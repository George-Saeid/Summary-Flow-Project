Translator’s Note to the Reader

In the author’s prologue to what is now called part I of Don Quixote (part
II appeared ten years later, in 1615, following the publication of a
continuation of the knight’s adventures written by someone using the
pseudonym “Avellaneda”), Cervantes said this about his book and the
need to write a preface for it:

I wanted only to offer it to you plain and bare, unadorned by a
prologue or the endless catalogue of sonnets, epigrams, and
laudatory poems that are usually placed at the beginning of
books.
Tell me, your grace: how much will
you pay me for each lash I give myself?”

“If I were to pay you, Sancho,” responded Don Quixote, “according

to what the greatness and nobility of this remedy deserve, the treasure of

Venice and the mines of Potosí would not be enough; estimate how much
of my money you are carrying, and then set a price for each lash.”

“The lashes,” responded Sancho, “amount to three thousand, three

hundred, and a few; of those I’ve given myself five: that leaves the rest;
let the five count as those few, and we come to the three thousand and
three hundred, which at a cuartillo each, and I won’t do it for less even if
the whole world ordered me to, comes to three thousand and three
hundred cuartillos, and that three thousand comes to fifteen hundred
half-reales, and that’s seven hundred fifty reales; and the three hundred
comes to one hundred fifty half-reales, which is seventy-five reales, and
add that to the seven hundred fifty, it comes to a total of eight hundred
twenty-five reales.
