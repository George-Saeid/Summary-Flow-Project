Remarkably, the Padua promptbook anticipates later acting texts by reducing 
the Folio's verbal density: the 'hard' language of Macbeth's speeches in Act 1, Scenes 
3 and 7, is trimmed; the Porter's part is cut entirely, as is Macbeth's interview with the 
murderers in Act 3, Scene 1; in Act 4, Scene 2, Ross loses his most impenetrable 
language (from 'I dare not speak' to 'Each way and none'); Macbeth's powerful 
soliloquy (Act 5, Scene 3) on 'the sere, the yellow leaf is cut; the other three Witches of 
Act 4, Scene 1, disappear, though Hecate may remain.
