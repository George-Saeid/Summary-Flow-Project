Then, it was as though everything was stripped away: sensation, memory, self, 
even the notion of existence that underlies reality - all seemed to have vanished 
utterly, their passing marked only by the realisation that they had disappeared, 
before that too ceased to have any meaning, and for an indefinite, infinite instant, 
there was only the awareness of something; something that possessed no mind, no 
purpose and no thought, except the knowledge that it was.
