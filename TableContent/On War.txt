BOOK TWO - On the Theory of War

ORIGINALLY THE TERM “ART OF WAR” ONLY

DESIGNATED THE PREPARATION OF THE FORCES

TRUE WAR FIRST APPEARS IN SIEGE WARFARE
NEXT THE SUBJECT WAS TOUCHED ON BY TACTICS
THE ACTUAL CONDUCT OF WAR OCCURRED ONLY

INCIDENTALLY AND INCOGNITO

REFLECTIONS ON THE EVENTS OF WAR LED TO THE NEED

FOR A THEORY

EFFORTS TO FORMULATE A POSITIVE THEORY
LIMITATION TO MATERIAL FACTORS
NUMERICAL SUPERIORITY
SUPPLY
BASE
INTERIOR LINES
ALL THESE ATTEMPTS ARE OBJECTIONABLE
THEY EXCLUDE GENIUS FROM THE RULE
PROBLEMS FACING THEORY WHEN MORAL FACTORS ARE

INVOLVED

MORAL VALUES CANNOT BE IGNORED IN WAR
PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS IN FORMULATING A THEORY OF

THE CONDUCT OF WAR

FIRST PROPERTY: MORAL FORCES AND EFFECTS -

HOSTILE FEELINGS

THE EFFECTS OF DANGER - COURAGE
EXTENT OF THE INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY DANGER
OTHER EMOTIONAL FACTORS
INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES
THE DIVERSITY OF INTELLECTUAL QUALITY RESULTS IN

A DIVERSITY OF ROADS TO THE GOAL

SECOND PROPERTY: POSITIVE REACTION
THIRD PROPERTY: UNCERTAINTY OF ALL INFORMATION

A POSITIVE DOCTRINE IS UNATTAINABLE
ALTERNATIVES WHICH MAKE A THEORY POSSIBLE - THE

DIFFICULTIES VARY IN MAGNITUDE

THEORY SHOULD BE STUDY, NOT DOCTRINE
THIS POINT OF VIEW MAKES THEORY POSSIBLE AND

ELIMINATES ITS CONFLICT WITH REALITY

THEORY THUS STUDIES THE NATURE OF ENDS AND

MEANS - ENDS AND MEANS IN TACTICS

FACTORS THAT ALWAYS ACCOMPANY THE APPLICATION

OF THE MEANS

TERRAIN
TIME OF DAY
WEATHER
ENDS AND MEANS IN STRATEGY
FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE APPLICATION OF THE

MEANS

THESE FACTORS FORM NEW MEANS
STRATEGY DERIVES THE MEANS AND ENDS TO BE

EXAMINED EXCLUSIVELY FROM EXPERIENCE

HOW FAR SHOULD AN ANALYSIS OF THE MEANS BE

CARRIED?
THE DIFFICULTY OF SEPARATING PERCEPTION FROM

JUDGMENT ART OF WAR

WAR IS AN ACT OF HUMAN INTERCOURSE

A. Interdependence of the Elements of War
B.
We see him complaining in Chapter
One of his view being “at odds with prevalent opinion,” and in Chapter Two
of the persistence of an “older view” by which “a battle accepted [that is,
initiated by the opponent] is regarded as already half lost.” In a later chapter
(Chapter Eighteen) we will see him speaking scornfully of “the clamor of
those whose vague emotions and still vaguer minds impel them to expect
everything from attack and movement, and whose idea of war is summed
up by a galloping hussar waving his sword.”

The modern soldier may know as a matter of practical experience that it

is sometimes necessary to assume a defensive posture (and he may even be
accustomed to seeing a “principle of security” included among the various
listings of “principles of war”) but that occasional necessity he is reluctant
to sanctify with any philosophy which imputes a special virtue to the
defensive.
