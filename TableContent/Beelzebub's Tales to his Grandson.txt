"They named the first seven fundamental aspects of each whole: 

1 erti-pikan-on 
2 ori-pikan-on 
3 sami-pikan-on 
4 okhti-pikan-on 
5 khooti-pikan-on 
6 epsi-pikan-on 
7 shvidi-pikan-on 

"And the second-order aspects: 

1 erti-noora-chaka 
2 ori-noora-chaka 
3 sami-noora-chakoo 

4 okhti-noora-chaka 
5 khooti-noora-chaka 
6 epsi-noora-chaka 
7 shvidi-noora-chakoo 

"And in order to indicate which of the three results of cosmic processes each 
of these names referred to, they added after each one the following: 
"For indicating the nuances of sound, after noting the number of their 

vibrations, they always added to the name the word 'alil. '
"In this connection you should know that this same 'hydrogen' is one of 
those seven cosmic substances which taken all together actualize for the given 
solar system what is called the 'inner ansapalnian octave' of cosmic 
substances, and that this independent octave, in its turn, is one of the seven in-
dependent parts of the 'fundamental common-cosmic ansapalnian octave ' 
"There is also an 'inner independent ansapalnian octave' present in the solar 
system to which our dear Karatas belongs, and we call its seven 
heterogeneous cosmic substances of different properties: 

1 planokurabâ€”which is their hydrogen  
2 alillonofarab  
3 krilnomolnifarab  
4 talkoprafarab 
5 khritofalmonofarab  
6 sirioonorifarab 
7 klananoizufarab  

"And on your planet, the genuine learned beings have given different names at 
different periods to these same seven 'rel-

atively independent' crystallizations of different properties or, according to 

their expression, 'active elements,' which compose the 'inner ansapalnian 

octave' of their own solar system, however, the contemporary 'learned 

chemists' there, who are already 'learned beings of new formation of the first 

water,' call them: 

1 hydrogen 
2 fluorine 
3 chlorine 
4 bromine 
5 iodine 

"They have no names at all for the last two definite crystallizations because 

these names did not reach them from their ancestors, and at the present time 

they do not even suspect the existence on their planet of these two cosmic 

substances, which are, nevertheless, the principal factors indispensable for 

their own existence.
