INTRODUCTION

These six plays for television span nearly twenty
years, but not evenly. The first four were written
close together (1965–7); Professional Foul followed
after a ten-year gap, and Squaring the Circle seven
years after that. My case history as a writer for
television understates my interest in plays on screen
but is fair comment otherwise. I wanted to be in the
theatre. The first play I wrote, in 1960, was meant
for the stage, and the next plays, for radio and TV,
were – I hoped – stepping stones towards getting a
play on the boards. 1967, the beginning of the ten-
year gap, was the year of my first professional stage
production in England.

This is not a philosophical claim for the value of

one medium over another. It is simply the way I felt,
and there were many like me in those early Osborne,
Wesker and Pinter years, when bliss was it to be
performed but to be staged was very heaven.

A Separate Peace was one half of an hour-long

programme consisting of a documentary and a play
which were supposed to illuminate each other. The
documentary 
(which 
I 
made 
with 
Christopher

Martin) was about chess. I now doubt that chess and
the desire to escape from the world are good
metaphors for each other.

Teeth, a Roald Dahl-type story (as I hoped), I take

this opportunity to dedicate to my much more recent
and much nicer dentist. Another Moon Called Earth
contributed a good deal to Jumpers: a woman who
won’t get out of bed, a husband working in the next

room, a death, a visiting detective. Penelope in this
play pushes someone out of the window and I began
Jumpers thinking that Dottie was going to be the
murderer of McFee.

Neutral Ground is based on Philoctetes by

Sophocles. It was written for a proposed Granda TV
series based on myths and legends. The series never
happened but three years later the play was taken
off the shelf and transmitted on its own, the only
vestige of its original inspiration being the hero’s
egregious name of Philo.

Leaving aside weightier matters, Professional Foul

serves as a good example of the concealed difficulty
in the most-asked question: ‘How long does it take to
write?’ When does one start counting? I had
promised to deliver a play by the last day of 1976 to
mark Amnesty International’s Prisoner of Conscience
Year (1977). On that day, after months of trying, I
had nothing to show, nothing begun and nothing in
mind. A visit to the USSR (not Czechoslovakia) finally
produced a ghost of a plot, and after that the play
was written in two or three weeks, including turning
a ballroom dancing team into the England Football
squad.

By comparison, the writing, rewriting, production

and post-production troubles of Squaring the Circle
were an endless saga (described in the Introduction
to the play’s first publication). Whether it is a play at
all, rather than a drama-documentary, is a question,
through perhaps not a vital one.

1966 by the BBC. The cast included:

JOHN BROWN
Peter Jeffrey

NURSE MAGGIE COATES
Hannah Gordon

DOCTOR
Ronald Hines

DIRECTOR
Alan Gibson

The office of the Beechwood Nursing Home. Behind
the reception counter sits a uniformed nurse. It is
2.30 a.m. A car pulls up outside. JOHN BROWN enters.
He is a biggish man, with a well-lined face: calm,
pleasant. He is wearing a nondescript suit and
overcoat, and carrying two zipped travelling bags.
Looking around, he notes the neatness, the quiet, the
flowers, the nice nurse, and is quietly pleased.

BROWN: Very nice.

NURSE: Good evening …

BROWN: ’Evening. A lovely night. Morning.

NURSE: Yes … Mr …?

BROWN: I’m sorry to be so late.

NURSE: (Shuffling papers) Were you expected earlier?

BROWN: No. I telephoned.

NURSE: Yes?

BROWN: Yes, You have a room for Mr Brown.

NURSE: Oh! – Have you brought him?

BROWN: I brought myself. Got a taxi by the station. I

telephoned from there.

NURSE: You said it was an emergency.

BROWN: That’s right. Do you know what time it is?

NURSE: It’s half-past two.

BROWN: That’s right. An emergency.

NURSE: (Aggrieved) I woke the house doctor.

BROWN: A kind thought. But it’s all right. Do you want me to

sign in?

NURSE: What is the nature of your emergency, Mr Brown?

BROWN: I need a place to stay.

NURSE: Are you ill?

BROWN: No.

NURSE: But this is a private hospital …

(BROWN smiles for the first time.)

BROWN: The best kind. What is a hospital without privacy? It’s

the privacy I’m after – that and the clean linen … (A
thought strikes him.) I’ve got money.

NURSE: … the Beechwood Nursing Home.

BROWN: I require nursing. I need to be nursed for a bit. Yes.

Where do I sign?

NURSE: I’m sorry, but admissions have to be arranged in

advance except in the case of a genuine emergency – I
have no authority –

BROWN: What do you want with authority? A nice person like

you.
(Moves.) Where have you put me?

NURSE: (Moves with him) And you have no authority –

BROWN: (Halts) That’s true. That’s one thing I’ve never had.

(He looks at her flatly.) I’ve come a long way.

NURSE: (Wary) Would you wait for just one moment?

BROWN: (Relaxes) Certainly. Have you got a sign-in book?

Must abide by the regulations. Should I pay in advance?

NURSE: No, that’s quite all right.

BROWN: I’ve got it – I’ve got it all in here –

(He starts trying to open one of the zipped cases, it jams
and he hurts his finger. He recoils sharply and puts his
finger in his mouth. The DOCTOR arrives, dishevelled from
being roused.)

NURSE: Doctor – this is Mr Brown.

DOCTOR: Good evening. What seems to be the trouble?

BROWN: Caught my finger.

DOCTOR: May I see?

(BROWN holds out his finger. The DOCTOR studies it, looks
up.)
(Guardedly.) Have you come far?

BROWN: Yes. I’ve been travelling all day.

(The DOCTOR glances at the NURSE.)
Not with my finger. I did that just now. Zip stuck.

DOCTOR: Oh. And what – er –

NURSE: Mr Brown says there’s nothing wrong with him.

BROWN: That’s right – I –

NURSE: He just wants a bed.

BROWN: A room.

DOCTOR: But this isn’t a hotel.

BROWN: Exactly.

DOCTOR: Exactly what?

BROWN: I don’t follow you.

DOCTOR: Perhaps I’m confused. You see, I was asleep.

BROWN: It’s all right. I understand. Well, if someone would

show me to my room, I shan’t disturb you any further.

DOCTOR: (With a glance at the NURSE) I don’t believe we have

any rooms free at the moment.

BROWN: Oh yes, this young lady arranged it.

NURSE: He telephoned from the station. He said it was an

emergency.

DOCTOR: But you’ve come to the wrong place.

NURSE: No, this is the place all right. What’s the matter?

DOCTOR: (Pause) Nothing – nothing’s the matter. (He nods at

the NURSE.) All right.

NURSE: Yes, doctor. (Murmurs worriedly.) I’ll have to make an

entry.

DOCTOR: Observation.

BROWN: (Cheerfully) I’m not much to look at.

NURSE: Let me take those for you, Mr Brown [the cases].

BROWN: No, no, don’t you. (Picks up cases.) There’s nothing

the matter with me …
(BROWN follows the NURSE inside. The DOCTOR watches them
go, picks up Brown’s form and reads it. Then he picks up
the phone and starts to dial.)

Brown’s private ward. A pleasant ward with a
hospital bed and the usual furniture. One wall is
almost all window and is curtained. BROWN and
NURSE enter. BROWN puts his cases on the bed. He
likes the room.

BROWN: That’s nice. I’ll like it here. (Peering through curtains)

What’s the view?

NURSE: Well, it’s the drive and the gardens.

BROWN: Gardens. A front room. What could be nicer?

(NURSE starts to open case.)

NURSE: Are your night things in here?

BROWN: Yes, I’ll be very happy here.

(NURSE opens the case, which is full of money – banknotes.)

NURSE: Oh – I’m sorry –

(BROWN is not put out at all.)

BROWN: What time is breakfast?

NURSE: Eight o’clock.

BROWN: Lunch?

NURSE: Twelve o’clock.

BROWN: Tea?

NURSE: Three o’clock.

BROWN: Supper?

NURSE: Half-past six.

BROWN: Cocoa?

NURSE: Nine.

BROWN: Like clockwork. Lovely.

(The DOCTOR enters with Brown’s form and an adhesive
bandage.)

DOCTOR: Excuse me.

BROWN: I was just saying – everything’s A1.

DOCTOR: I remembered your finger.

BROWN: I’d forgotten myself. It’s nothing.

DOCTOR: Well, we’ll just put this on overnight.

(He puts on the adhesive strip.)
I expect Matron will be along to discuss your case with
you tomorrow.

BROWN: My finger?

DOCTOR: … Well, I expect she’d like to meet you.

BROWN: Be pleased to meet her.

The hospital office. It is morning and the DOCTOR is
at the desk, telephoning.

DOCTOR: … I have absolutely no idea … The nurse said it

looked like rather a lot … His savings, yes. No, I don’t
really want the police turning up at the bedside of any
patient who doesn’t arrive with a life history … I think
we’d get more out of him than you would, given a little
time … No, he’s not being difficult at all … You don’t need
to worry about that – he seems quite happy …

Brown’s private ward. BROWN is in striped pyjamas,
eating off a tray. A second nurse – NURSE COATES
(MAGGIE) – is waiting for him to finish so that she can
take his tray away. MAGGIE is pretty and warm.

BROWN: The point is not breakfast in bed, but breakfast in bed

without guilt – if you’re not ill. Lunch in bed is more
difficult, even for the rich. It’s not any more expensive, but
the disapproval is harder to ignore. To stay in bed for tea
is almost impossible in decent society, and not to get up at
all would probably bring in the authorities. But in a
hospital it’s not only understood – it’s expected. That’s the
beauty of it. I’m not saying it’s a great discovery – it’s
obvious really – but I’d say I’d got something.

MAGGIE: If you’d got something, there wouldn’t be all this

fuss.

BROWN: Is there a fuss?

(MAGGIE doesn’t answer.)
I’m paying my way … Are you pretty full all the time?

MAGGIE: Not at the moment, not very.

BROWN: You’d think a place as nice as this would be very

popular.

MAGGIE: Popular?

BROWN: I thought I might have to wait for a place, you know.

MAGGIE: Where do you live?

BROWN: I’ve never lived. Only stayed.

MAGGIE: You should settle down somewhere.

BROWN: Yes, I’ve been promising myself this.

MAGGIE: Have you got a family?

BROWN: I expect so.

MAGGIE: Where are they?

BROWN: I lost touch.

MAGGIE: You should find them.

BROWN: (Smiles) Their name’s Brown.

(The MATRON enters: she is not too old and quite pleasant.)

MATRON: Good morning.

BROWN: Good morning to you. You must be Matron.

MATRON: That’s right.

BROWN: I must congratulate you on your hospital, it’s a lovely

place you run here. Everyone is so nice.

MATRON: Well, thank you, Mr Brown. I’m glad you feel at

home.
(MAGGIE takes Brown’s tray.)

BROWN: I never felt it there. Very good breakfast. Just what

the doctor ordered. I hope he got a bit of a lie-in.
(MAGGIE exits with the tray, closing the door.)

MATRON: Now, what’s your problem, Mr Brown?

BROWN: I have no problems.

MATRON: Your complaint.

BROWN: I have no complaints either. Full marks.

MATRON: Most people who come here have something the

matter with them.

BROWN: That must give you a lot of extra work.

MATRON: But it’s what we’re here for. You see, you can’t really

stay unless there’s something wrong with you.

BROWN: I can pay.

MATRON: That’s not the point.

BROWN: What is the point?

MATRON: This is a hospital. What are you after?

BROWN: (Sadly) My approach is too straightforward. An

ordinary malingerer or a genuine hypochondriac wouldn’t
have all this trouble. They’d be accepted on their own
terms. All I get is a lot of personal questions. (Hopefully.)
Maybe I could catch something … But what difference
would it make to you?

MATRON: We have to keep the beds free for people who need

them.

BROWN: I need this room.

MATRON: I believe you, Mr Brown – but wouldn’t another room

like this one do? Somewhere else? You see, we deal with
physical matters – of the body –

BROWN: There’s nothing wrong with my mind. You won’t find

my name on any list.

MATRON: I know.

BROWN: (Teasing) How do you know?

(She doesn’t answer.)
Go for the obvious, it’s worth considering. I know what I

like: a nice atmosphere – good food – clean rooms – no
demands – cheerful staff – Well, it’s worth the price. I
won’t be any trouble.

MATRON: Have you thought of going to a nice country hotel?

BROWN: Different kettle of fish altogether. I want to do

nothing, and have nothing expected of me. That isn’t
possible out there. It worries them. They want to know
what you’re at – staying in your room all the time – they
want to know what you’re doing. But in a hospital it is
understood that you’re not doing anything, because
everybody’s in the same boat – it’s the normal thing.

MATRON: But there’s nothing wrong with you!

BROWN: That’s why I’m here. If there was something wrong

with me I could get into any old hospital – free. As it is, I’m
quite happy to pay for not having anything wrong with me.

MATRON: But what do you want to do here?

BROWN: Nothing.

MATRON: You’ll find that very boring.

BROWN: One must expect to be bored, in a hospital.

MATRON: Have you been in a hospital quite a lot?

BROWN: No. I’ve been saving up for it … (He smiles.)

The hospital office. The DOCTOR is phoning at a desk.

DOCTOR: No luck? … Oh. Well, I don’t know. The only plan

we’ve got is to bore him out of here, but he’s disturbingly
self-sufficient … Mmmm, we’ve had a psychiatrist over …
Well, he seemed amused … Both of them, actually; they
were both amused … No, I shouldn’t do that, he won’t tell
you anything. And there’s one of our nurses – she’s getting
on very well with him … something’s bound to come out
soon …

Brown’s ward. BROWN is in bed with a thermometer
in his mouth. MAGGIE is taking his pulse. She
removes the thermometer, scans it and shakes it.

MAGGIE: I’m wasting my time here, you know.

BROWN: (Disappointed) Normal?

MAGGIE: You’ll have to do better than that if you’re going to

stay.

BROWN: You’re breaking my heart, Maggie.

MAGGIE: (Almost lovingly) Brownie, what are you doing to do

with yourself?

BROWN: Maggie, Maggie … Why do you want me to do

something?

MAGGIE: They’ve all got theories about you, you know.

BROWN: Theories?

MAGGIE: Train robber.

BROWN: That’s a good one.

MAGGIE: Embezzler.

BROWN: Naturally.

MAGGIE: Eccentric millionaire.

BROWN: Wish I was. I’d have my own hospital, just for myself –

with nurses, doctors, rubber floors, flowers, stretchers
parked by the elevators, clean towels and fire regulations
…

MAGGIE: It’s generally agreed you’re on the run.

BROWN: No, I’ve stopped.

MAGGIE: I think you’re just lazy.

BROWN: I knew you were the clever one.

MAGGIE: (Troubled, soft) Tell me what’s the matter, Brownie?

BROWN: I would if there was.

MAGGIE: What do you want to stay here for, then?

BROWN: I like you.

MAGGIE: You didn’t know I was here.

BROWN: That’s true. I came for the quiet and the routine. I

came for the white calm, meals on trays and quiet
efficiency, time passing and bringing nothing. That seemed
enough. I never got it down to a person. But I like you – I
like you very much.

MAGGIE: Well, I like you too, Brownie. But there’s more in life

than that.
(MATRON enters.)

MATRON: Good morning.

BROWN: Good morning, Matron.

MATRON: And how are we this morning?

BROWN: We’re very well. How are you?

MATRON: (Slightly taken aback) I’m all right, thank you. Well,

are you enjoying life?

BROWN: Yes, thank you, Matron.

MATRON: What have you been doing?

BROWN: Nothing.

MATRON: Now really, Mr Brown, this won’t do, you know.

Wouldn’t you like to get up for a while? Have a walk in the
garden? There’s no reason why you shouldn’t.

BROWN: No, I suppose not. But I didn’t come here for that. I

must have walked thousands of miles, in my time.

MATRON: It’s not healthy to stay in bed all day.

BROWN: What do the other patients do?

MATRON: The other patients are here because they are not

well.

BROWN: I thought patients did things … (Vaguely) made

things.

MATRON: I suppose you wouldn’t like to make paper flowers?

BROWN: What on earth for? You’ve got lots of real ones.

MATRON: You haven’t got any.

BROWN: Well, no one knows I’m here.

MATRON: Then you must tell somebody.

BROWN: I don’t want them to know.

MATRON: Who?

BROWN: Everybody.

MATRON: You’ll soon get tired of sitting in bed.

BROWN: Then I’ll sit by the window. I’m easily pleased.

MATRON: I can’t let you languish away in here. You must do

something.

BROWN: (Sighs) All right. What?

MATRON: We’ve got basket-weaving …?

BROWN: Then I’ll be left alone, will I?

The hospital office. The DOCTOR is on the phone.

DOCTOR: Well, I don’t know – how many John Browns are there

in Somerset House? … Good grief! … Of course, if it’s any
consolation it may not be his real name … I know it doesn’t
help … That’s an idea, yes … His fingerprints … No, no, I’ll
get them on a glass or something – Well, he might have
been in trouble some time …

Brown’s ward. BROWN is working on a shapeless
piece of basketry.

MATRON enters.

MATRON: What is it?

BROWN: Basketwork.

MATRON: But what is it for?

BROWN: Therapy.

MATRON: You’re making fun of me.

BROWN: It is functional on one level only. If that. You’d like me

to make a sort of laundry basket and lower myself in it out
of the window. That would be functional on two levels. At
least.
(Regards the mess sadly.) And I’m not even blind.
(MATRON silently dispossesses BROWN of his basketry.)

MATRON: What about painting, Mr Brown?

(That strikes a chord.)

BROWN: Painting … I used to do a bit of painting.

MATRON: Splendid. Would you do some for me?

BROWN: Paint in here?

MATRON: Nurse Coates will bring you materials.

BROWN: What colours do you like?

MATRON: I like all colours. Just paint what you fancy. Paint

scenes from your own life.

BROWN: Clever! Should I paint my last place of employment?

MATRON: I’m trying to help you.

BROWN: I’m sorry. I know you are. But I don’t need help.

Everything’s fine for me. (Pause.) Would you like me to
paint the countryside?

MATRON: Yes, that would be nice.

The hospital office. The DOCTOR is on the phone.

DOCTOR: No … well, we haven’t got anything against him

really. He’s not doing any harm. No, he pays regularly. We
can’t really refuse … He’s got lots left …

Brown’s ward. BROWN is painting a landscape all
aver one wall. He hasn’t got very far, but one sees
the beginnings of a simple pastoral scene, competent
but amateurish. MAGGIE enters, carrying cut flowers
in a vase.

MAGGIE: Hello – (She notices.)

BROWN: I’ll need some more paint.

MAGGIE: (Horrified) Brownie! I gave you drawing paper!

BROWN: I like space. I like the big sweep – the contours of

hills all flowing.

MAGGIE: Matron will have a fit.

BROWN: What are the flowers?

MAGGIE: You don’t deserve them.

BROWN: Who are they from?

MAGGIE: Me.

BROWN: Maggie!

MAGGIE: I didn’t buy them.

BROWN: Pinched them?

MAGGIE: Picked them.

BROWN: A lovely thought. Put them over there. I should bring

you flowers.

MAGGIE: I’m not ill.

BROWN: Nor am I. Do you like it?

MAGGIE: Very pretty.

BROWN: I’m only doing it to please Matron really. I could do

with a bigger brush. There’s more paint, is there? I’ll need
a lot of blue. It’s going to be summer in here.

MAGGIE: It’s summer outside. Isn’t that good enough for you?

(BROWN stares out of the window: gardens, flowers, trees,
hills.)

BROWN: I couldn’t stay out there. You don’t get the benefits.

MAGGIE: (Leaving) I’ll have to tell Matron, you know.

BROWN: You don’t get the looking after. And the privacy. (He

considers.) I’ll have to take the curtains down.

The hospital office.

MATRON: What did the psychiatrist think?

DOCTOR: He likes him.

MATRON: (Sour) He’s likeable.

DOCTOR: (Thoughtfully) I just thought I’d let him stay the

night. I wanted to go back to bed and it seemed the easiest
thing to do. I thought that in the morning … Well, I’m not
sure what I thought would happen in the morning.

MATRON: He’s not simple – he’s giving nothing away. Not even

to Nurse Coates.

DOCTOR: Well, keep her at it.

MATRON: She doesn’t need much keeping.

Brown’s ward. BROWN has painted a whole wall and
is working on a second one. MAGGIE sits on the bed.

MAGGIE: That was when I started nursing, after that.

BROWN: Funny. I would have thought your childhood was all to

do with ponies and big stone-floored kitchens …

MAGGIE: Goes to show. What was your childhood like?

BROWN: Young … I wish I had more money.

MAGGIE: You’ve got a lot. You must have had a good job …?

BROWN: Centre forward for Arsenal.

MAGGIE: You’re not fair! You don’t give me anything in return.

BROWN: This painting’s for you, Maggie … If I’d got four times

as much money, I’d take four rooms and paint one for each
season. But I’ve only got money for the summer.

MAGGIE: What will you do when it’s gone?

BROWN: (Seriously) I don’t know. Perhaps I’ll get ill and have

to go to a hospital. But I’ll miss you, Maggie.

MAGGIE: If you had someone to look after you you wouldn’t

have this trouble.

BROWN: What trouble?

MAGGIE: If you had someone to cook your meals and do your

laundry you’d be all right, wouldn’t you?

BROWN: It’s the things that go with it.

MAGGIE: You should have got married. I bet you had chances.

BROWN: Perhaps.

MAGGIE: It’s not too late.

BROWN: You don’t think so?

MAGGIE: You’re attractive.

BROWN: What are you like when you’re not in uniform? I can’t

think of you not being a nurse. It belongs to another world
I’m not part of any more.

MAGGIE: What have you got about hospitals?

BROWN: A hospital is a very dependable place. Anything could

be going on outside. Since I’ve been in here – there could
be a war on, and for once it’s got nothing to do with me. I
don’t even know about it. Fire, flood and misery of all
kinds, across the world or over the hill, it can go on, but
this is a private ward; I’m paying for it. (Pause.) The meals

come in on trays, on the dot – the dust never settles before
it’s wiped – clean laundry at the appointed time – the
matron does her round, not affected by anything outside.
You need never know anything, it doesn’t touch you.

MAGGIE: That’s not true, Brownie.

BROWN: I know it’s not.

MAGGIE: Then you shouldn’t try and make it true.

BROWN: I know I shouldn’t.

(Pause.)

MAGGIE: Is that all there is to it, then?

BROWN: You’ve still got theories?

MAGGIE: There’s a new one. You’re a retired forger.

BROWN: Ha! The money’s real enough.

MAGGIE: I know.

BROWN: How do you know?

MAGGIE: (Shamefaced) They had it checked.

(BROWN laughs.)

BROWN: They’ve got to make it difficult. I’ve got to be a crook

or a lunatic.

MAGGIE: Then why don’t you tell them where you came from?

BROWN: They want to pass me on. But they don’t know who to,

or where. I’m happy here.

MAGGIE: Haven’t you been happy anywhere else?

BROWN: Yes. I had a good four years of it once.

MAGGIE: In hospital?

BROWN: No, that was abroad.

MAGGIE: Where have you been?

BROWN: All over. I’ve been among French, Germans, Greeks,

Turks, Arabs …

MAGGIE: What were you doing?

BROWN: Different things in different places. (Smiles.) I was

painting in France.

MAGGIE: An artist?

BROWN: Oh very. Green and brown. I could turn a row of tanks

into a leafy hedgerow. Not literally. Worse luck.

The hospital office. The DOCTOR is on the phone.

DOCTOR: … He meant camouflage … Well, I realize that, but

there are a number of points to narrow the field … Must be
records of some kind … Service in France and Germany,
probably Middle East …

Brown’s ward. BROWN has painted two walls and is
working on a third.

MAGGIE: It’s very nice, Brownie. Perhaps you’ll be famous and

people will come here to see your mural.

BROWN: I wouldn’t let them in.

MAGGIE: After you’re dead. In a hundred years.

BROWN: Yes, they could come in then.

MAGGIE: What will you do when you’ve finished the room?

BROWN: Go back to bed. It’ll be nice in here. Hospital routine

in a pastoral setting. That’s kind of perfection, really.

MAGGIE: You could have put your bed in the garden.

BROWN: What’s the date?

MAGGIE: The twenty-seventh.

BROWN: I’ve lasted well, haven’t I?

MAGGIE: How old are you?

BROWN: Twice your age.

MAGGIE: Forty-four?

BROWN: And more. (Looking close.) What are you thinking?

MAGGIE: Before I was born, you were in the war.

BROWN: (Moves) Yes. Private Brown.

MAGGIE: Was it awful being in the war?

BROWN: I didn’t like the first bit. But in the end it was very

nice.

MAGGIE: What happened to you?

BROWN: I got taken prisoner … Four years.

MAGGIE: Is that when you were happy?

BROWN: Yes … Funny thing, that camp. Up to then it was all

terrible. Chaos – all the pins must have fallen off the map,
dive bombers and bullets. Oh dear, yes. The camp was like
breathing out for the first time in months. I couldn’t
believe it. It was like winning, being captured. The war
was still going on but I wasn’t going to it any more. They
gave us food, life was regulated, in a box of earth and wire
and sky. On my second day I knew what it reminded me of.

MAGGIE: What?

BROWN: Here. It reminded me of here.

The hospital office. Present are the DOCTOR, MATRON
and MAGGIE. The DOCTOR holding a big book – a
record of admissions, his finger on a line.

DOCTOR: John Brown. And an address. (To MAGGIE.) Well done.

MAGGIE: (Troubled) But does it make any difference?

MATRON: What was he doing round here?

DOCTOR: Staying with relatives – or holiday, we can find out.

MATRON: So long ago?

DOCTOR: Compound fracture – car accident. The driver paid

for him … Well, something to go on at last!

MAGGIE: He hasn’t done anything wrong, has he?

Brown’s ward. The painting nearly covers the walls.
BROWN is finishing it off in one corner.

BROWN: I was a regular, you see, and peace didn’t match up to

the war I’d had. There was too much going on.

MAGGIE: So what did you do then?

BROWN: This and that. Didn’t fancy a lot. (He paints.)

Shouldn’t you be working, or something?

MAGGIE: I’ll go if you like.

BROWN: I like you being here. Just wondered.

MAGGIE: Wondered what?

BROWN: I’m telling you about myself, aren’t I? I shouldn’t put

you in that position – if they find out they’ll blame you for
not passing it on.

MAGGIE: But you haven’t done anything wrong, have you,

Brownie?

BROWN: Is that what you’re here for?

MAGGIE: No.

(BROWN finishes off the painting and stands back.)

BROWN: There.

MAGGIE: It’s lovely.

BROWN: Yes. Quite good. It’ll be nice, to sit here inside my

painting. I’ll enjoy that.

The hospital office. The DOCTOR is on the phone.

DOCTOR: … Brown. John Brown – yes, he was here before, a

long time ago – we’ve got him in the records – Mmm – and
an address. We’ll start checking … there must be
somebody …

Brown’s ward. The walls are covered with paintings.
BROWN is sitting on the bed. The door opens and a
strange nurse – NURSE JONES – enters with Brown’s
lunch on a tray.

JONES: Are you ready for lunch –? (Sees the painting.) My, my,

aren’t you clever – it’s better than anyone would have
thought.

BROWN: Where’s Maggie?

JONES: Nurse Coates? I don’t know.

BROWN: But – she’s my nurse.

JONES: Yours? Well, she’s everybody’s.

BROWN: (Worried) You don’t understand – she’s looking after

me, you see.
(The DOCTOR enters; NURSE JONES leaves.)

DOCTOR: (Cheerful) Well, Mr Brown, good news.

BROWN: (Wary) Yes?

DOCTOR: You’re going to have visitors.

BROWN: Visitors?

DOCTOR: Your sister Mabel and her husband. They were

amazed to hear from you.

BROWN: They didn’t hear from me.

DOCTOR: They’re travelling up tomorrow. All your friends had

been wondering where you’d got to –

BROWN: Where’s Nurse Coates gone?

DOCTOR: Nowhere. She’s round about. I think she’s on nights

downstairs this week. I understand that you were here
once before – as a child.

BROWN: Yes. (Angrily) You couldn’t leave well alone, could

you?

DOCTOR: (Pause; not phoney any more) It’s not enough, Mr

Brown. You’ve got to … connect …

The 
hospital 
office. 
BROWN 
appears, 
dressed,

carrying his bags, from the direction of his room. He
sees MAGGIE and stops. She sees him.

MAGGIE: Brownie! Where are you going?

BROWN: Back.

MAGGIE: Back where?

(He does not answer.)
You blame me?

BROWN: No. No. I don’t really. You had to tell them, didn’t

you?

MAGGIE: I’m sorry – I –

BROWN: You thought it was for the best.

MAGGIE: Yes, I did. I still do. It’s not good for you, what you’re

doing.

BROWN: How do you know? – you mean it wouldn’t be good for

you. How do you know what’s good for me?

MAGGIE: They’re coming tomorrow. Family, friends; isn’t that

good?

BROWN: I could have found them, if I’d wanted. I didn’t come

here for that. (Comes up to her.) They won. (Looks out
through the front doors.) I feel I should breathe in before
going out there.

MAGGIE: I can’t let you go, Brownie.

BROWN: (Gently mocking) Regulations?

MAGGIE: I can’t.

BROWN: I’m free to come and go. I’m paying.

MAGGIE: I know – but it is a hospital.

BROWN: (Smiles briefly) I’m not ill. Don’t wake the doctor, he

doesn’t like being woken. (Moves.) Don’t be sorry – I had a
good time here with you. Do you think they’ll leave my
painting?

MAGGIE: Brownie …

BROWN: Trouble is, I’ve always been so well. If I’d been sick I

would have been all right.
(He goes out into the night.)

DIRECTOR
Alan Gibson

The waiting room.
Tatty furniture, ancient magazines.
Three people.
AGNES and FLORA sit together, conspiratorially, on a
settee, speaking quietly, on the borderline of
audibility as far as GEORGE POLLOCK is concerned.
From behind his illustrated paper he eavesdrops, his
eyes switching over the top of his paper. That is to
say, we see the paper first (it is Woman’s Own) and
then GEORGE peeps from behind it. We note, now or
later, that he has been studying a bra-and-panty ad.
But  AGNES is coming through now.

AGNES: The first thing I thought was – I’ll have to kill myself

now.

FLORA: No!

AGNES: Oh yes. I knew it was the end. And it was the real

thing for me.

FLORA: He wasn’t worth it.

AGNES: (Sighs) I don’t know. There never was another for me.

FLORA: Plenty of fish in the sea, I say.

AGNES: Different kettle altogether. Yes, I seriously considered

it.

That’ll teach him, I thought.

FLORA: What’ll?

AGNES: Killing myself.

FLORA: Ah. Serve him right.

AGNES: Yes, it would’ve. You’ll be sorry, I thought, Jack

Stevens – then you’ll know. (Sighs again.) Yes, I came
close; I wouldn’t be here today if we hadn’t been all-
electric.

FLORA: (Nods sympathetically) He was luckier than he knew.

AGNES: He would’ve carried his burden of guilt to his grave …

instead of which he’s got a very nice trading station in the
China Seas. (A reprise) … You’ll be sorry, Jack Stevens –
then you’ll know what you’ve done.

FLORA: What brought it about, then?

bathroom without knocking.

FLORA: No!

AGNES: Without so much as a by your leave.

FLORA: Disgusting.

AGNES: Said he didn’t know I was in there.

FLORA: Wells he would, wouldn’t he?

AGNES: And he did.

FLORA: What did you do?

AGNES: Turned my back quick as a flash. But he’d seen.

FLORA: He knew what he was doing all right.

AGNES: ‘Agnes,’ he said, ‘what have you done to your teeth?!’

(Pause.)

FLORA: Teeth?

AGNES: I was brushing my teeth after dinner. It’s only the two

middle ones that come out – the rest’s my own, what there
is, but of course it’s the gap, isn’t it?

FLORA: Oh yes. It’s the gap that’d give you away.

AGNES: (Recalling it with tragic clarity) ‘Agnes, … what have

you done to your teeth?!’ … It wasn’t the same after that
with Jack Stevens. A week later he’d got his third mate’s
papers and he was taken away, over the horizon, by a dirty
black tramp – yeh, Irene Castle from Cardiff, I still look out
for her.

FLORA: Got all her own teeth, has she?

AGNES: ’sa boat.

(POLLOCK – hereafter GEORGE – has allowed his curiosity to
leave him exposed, ear cocked, eavesdropping. The two
women catch him at it. He gives them a great white smile.
The door into the reception room opens. The receptionist
(the WIFE) does not notice GEORGE at first and seems about
to summon one of the two women. But GEORGE has stood
up. The WIFE is somewhat taken aback but recovers. She
changes the summons.)

WIFE: Er … Mr Pollock …

(The women stare at the queue-jumper GEORGE as he
follows the WIFE, smiling.)
(To the women) Mr Dunn won’t keep you a moment …
(GEORGE and the WIFE go into the reception room. As soon
as the door is closed behind them, the WIFE turns to him in

urgent enquiry, keeping her voice down.)
What’s the matter?

GEORGE: Nothing – I mean –

WIFE: You shouldn’t come here –

(She glances at the second closed door, which leads into
the surgery.)

GEORGE: Why not?

WIFE: I’m not impressed – just because you’ve got a guilty

conscience –

GEORGE: No …

WIFE: Well, you should have –

GEORGE: I’m sorry, lover – I was terribly disappointed myself

really disappointed.

WIFE: And don’t call me lover –

GEORGE: I’m sorry – (Tries to touch) Who gave you those

earrings –?

WIFE: (Moves away) You let me down –

GEORGE: I had to demonstrate a new line – there was big

money involved – They [earrings] aren’t real pearl, are
they? Can’t be –

WIFE: You’ve got another on the side – How many sides have

you got?

GEORGE: Oh now, that’s cynical, that is –

WIFE: Yesterday of all days –

GEORGE: Listen, you mustn’t be so possessive – who gave you

those earrings?

WIFE: A very good friend.

GEORGE: Don’t give me that – you’re a respectable married

woman. It was Harry, was it?

WIFE: It was my birthday –

GEORGE: I know it was your birthday – I told you I couldn’t get

away.

me.

GEORGE: How could I? – Think of last Saturday after tea – it

doesn’t add up –

WIFE: Lust –

GEORGE: Oh, I’m hurt –

WIFE: I knew it was a mistake –

GEORGE: Don’t let’s have regrets –

WIFE: Don’t make me laugh –

GEORGE: Don’t cry –

WIFE: You make me sick. I don’t care anyway – I’ve been

looking about, too, you know –

course [the earrings] –

WIFE: Think you can get away with anything – will you please

stop grinning!

GEORGE: Smiling – I’ve got a nice smile – Come here, you

misguided sexy insatiable receptionist you –
(He reaches to touch her; she recoils. Eyes on surgery
door.)

WIFE: For goodness’ sake!

GEORGE: He can’t hear us.

WIFE: Anyway, I’m working –

GEORGE: Live dangerously – let yourself go –

WIFE: Oh, give over –

GEORGE: You like my smile really – it’s one of the two things

you like about me –

WIFE: You’re only like this when you’re trying to make up –

GEORGE: We’re friends again, aren’t we?

WIFE: Are we?

GEORGE: Kiss and make up –

WIFE: Listen, you can’t carry on like that here –

GEORGE: Don’t worry about him –

WIFE: You’ve got to go now – you shouldn’t have come – there

are patients waiting –

GEORGE: I’m a patient –

WIFE: Please, George – they’ve got appointments –

GEORGE: I’ve got an appointment –

WIFE: You haven’t –

GEORGE: Yes I have –

WIFE: What for?

GEORGE: Teeth.

WIFE: You’ve got toothache?

GEORGE: No, it’s my check-up. Six-monthly.

WIFE: It’s not. (Going to her desk diary.)

GEORGE: Yes it is – would you care to examine me?

WIFE: Oh, stop it, will you? – (Scanning the diary) I can’t find

it –

GEORGE: There was a reminder at the office –

WIFE: What reminder?

– you can’t keep your mind on it, or off the other.

be nice –

GEORGE: I am being nice – I’m charming the pants off you –

that’s what brought us together.
(He advances, she backs, glancing at the surgery door.)

WIFE: You make me ashamed.

(The surgery door opens; the WIFE jumps; HARRY DUNN
smiles.)
Look who’s here, Harry.

HARRY: Hello, George. Nice to see you.

GEORGE: How are you, Harry?

HARRY: Ready and waiting.

WIFE: I’m sorry – we were –

GEORGE: Having a natter.

HARRY: Right you are. Well, come on in. (To the WIFE) Tell you

what – as it’s George, while I’m just giving him the once-
over, could you carry on with the files. I’ll give you a buzz
if there’s any concrete to be mixed.

GEORGE: You won’t find much wrong with my choppers.

HARRY: (To the WIFE) In flashing form, is he?

GEORGE: Ooh, he’s wicked, isn’t he?

(The WIFE smiles wanly. The two men go into the surgery,

HARRY closing the door. HARRY has a full complement of
dental apparatus. It is a good-sized surgery, and the chair
and machine sit in a good space, silent, waiting, ready for

GEORGE. HARRY and GEORGE look at it a moment, as though
the apparatus were a third occupant.) Well …
(He goes to meet it. Sits in the chair. There is some little
‘business’ over the first few lines of dialogue: principally,

HARRY is sorting and readying a few shiny metal
implements, and he fixes the paper-towel bib round

GEORGE’s neck.
The machine is a modern one. Its body holds two or three
squirters, rather like the nozzle of a petrol pump, only the
rubber tube attached disappears into the machine when
the nozzle is not in use: plus a swivel table for the tools:

and the big praying-mantis leg of the high-speed drill.

HARRY should make use of all his took and nozzles,
squirting air and water, swivelling, drilling, etc. The point
is that HARRY is playing with GEORGE. The dental procedure
does not have to he authentic or accurate. The director
and actors can assume that there is nothing much wrong
with 
GEORGE’s teeth, and that 
there 
is 
a 
logical

rationalization for using the machine indiscriminately for
effect.)

HARRY: Haven’t seen you for a while.

GEORGE: No – you know how it is. I’ve hardly had time to turn

round.

HARRY: Hard at it, are you?

GEORGE: My life’s not my own.

HARRY: Yes, I was only saying to Prudence – we haven’t seen

George for ages.

GEORGE: Yes, we’ll have to get together.

HARRY: Of course, we lead a very quiet life compared to yours,

I expect.

GEORGE: I’m never at home.

HARRY: Out and about, on the town – that’s George all over – I

told Prudence.

GEORGE: On the job.

HARRY: Lovely work if you can get it. Mind you, we haven’t

had a lot of chance anyway – with Prudence going to the
evening classes.

GEORGE: Oh yes.

HARRY: Did you know about that?

GEORGE: Er … no.

HARRY: Shows how long it is since we had you round. Now,

let’s have a look at you.
(GEORGE opens his mouth. HARRY peers and probes …)
… Yes, there’s her flower-arranging … dressmaking – I
don’t know, she shouldn’t be bored – I mean, she’s a
career woman really – but she’s got to fill up her life. And
then there’s her charity work … did you know about her
charity work?

GEORGE: (Signifies denial) Ughnugh.

HARRY: Must have been soon after we last saw you that she

took it up. Helps with old people, once or twice a week,

takes them about, cheers them up, poor things. She’s more
out than in … Still, it’s only a matter of time till I’m an old
person so I expect she’ll have more time for me then …
(Smiles; withdraws.)
(GEORGE closes his mouth. Reaches for the mouthwash.)

GEORGE: Well, mud in your eye, Harry – I see it’s your round.

(GEORGE washes out his mouth and sits back.)

HARRY: No wonder she’s so tired.

GEORGE: What?

HARRY: Prudence. Yes, I was only saying to her – it’s about

time we had George and Mary round for a game of cards.
We used to enjoy that. Lovely girl, Mary – one of the best.
Just as well she’s a working wife, I suppose.

GEORGE: How do you mean?

HARRY: How’s your social life?

GEORGE: Oh, very quiet.

HARRY: Quiet evenings at home.

GEORGE: That sort of thing. Only I’m never there. That’s why

they’re quiet.
(He starts to laugh, but has to open his mouth for HARRY.)

HARRY: Yes, just as well for Mary – she’s not the sort to sit

around the house …
(He probes.)
You’ve been letting yourself go a bit, haven’t you?
(GEORGE’s worried eyes.)
I’m glad you came in today – this is a serious warning,
George. You think what people can’t see isn’t happening –
but it all comes out in the end. Your sins always find you
out.
(GEORGE’s eyes; HARRY probes.)
I can spot the signs you know, a mile off, so you better
watch it, hadn’t you? I must say, I wouldn’t have thought it
of you.
(He withdraws long enough for –)

GEORGE: Now hold on, Harry –

(HARRY flicks on the spotlight. The glare is in GEORGE’s eyes.

GEORGE grips the sides of the chair.)

HARRY: I’m giving you fair warning – and Mary wouldn’t thank

you for it if it came to the worst, would she?

GEORGE: Look here –

(HARRY squirts.)

HARRY: Gums – it’s your gums you have to watch, they’re the

ones doing it. You haven’t been taking my advice – I told
you: daily massage and woodpoints in the crannies. If your
gums go then the lot goes. (He withdraws.) A serious
warning, George.

GEORGE: Oh – (In relief he takes a swig of water.)

HARRY: You’re not supposed to drink it.

GEORGE: My teeth are fine, Harry – I mean I don’t want to

teach you your job but – (He has to open his mouth to say
‘but’ and in goes the steel.)

HARRY: No pain? – there?

(Jab. GEORGE jumps.)
Yes, I thought as much.

GEORGE: You caught my gum there, Harry –

(HARRY sighs and turns away, fiddling with his tools.)

HARRY: Ah well … Yes, I’ve given it a bit of thought and I’m

going to have it out.

GEORGE: What?

HARRY: I mean – she gets home absolutely dead beat. She just

wants to go to sleep.

GEORGE: Oh. Well, I suppose it takes it out of her.

HARRY: The flower-arranging?

GEORGE: 
Oh 
well, 
I 
suppose 
it 
requires 
a 
certain

concentration.

HARRY: You may be right. You’ve got the best of it.

GEORGE: Me?

HARRY: Well, entertaining clients and that sort of thing – at

least you can take Mary along.

GEORGE: Oh, it’s not her kind of thing. Business, you know. It’s

just hard work.

HARRY: Same boat, then.

GEORGE: Yes.

HARRY: Of course, women notice these things.

GEORGE: What?

HARRY: When you get home dead beat. Just want to go

straight to sleep.

GEORGE: Oh yes.

HARRY: Same thing with me and Prudence. Only the other way

round, of course. Makes one very tense, you know – and in

my job you’ve got to have a very steady hand, got to be
cool and calm – (He turns round with a wicked tool.)

GEORGE: Harry! – (He brings his voice down.) There’s nothing

wrong, is there, Harry?

HARRY: Well, I’ve seen better, George. I don’t know if I can

save that one.

GEORGE: Don’t be daft.

HARRY: Pink toothbrush – admit it.

GEORGE: What?

HARRY: They’ve been bleeding, when you brush your teeth.

GEORGE: Well, a bit, perhaps. Now and again.

HARRY: Pyorrhoea.

GEORGE: What?

HARRY: Setting in. (Shakes his head.) I’ve told you before,

George – you’ve only got one set of teeth. Let them go
once and they’ve gone for good. Now look at my teeth –
(He shows them) I wasn’t born with better teeth than you,
but I look after them. I massage the gums. Use woodpoints
on them. I’ve got a row of good strong white shiny teeth
for that. See? Teeth are very important on every level. I
mean, apart from anything else, it was my teeth that first
attracted Prudence to me – she told me that.
(GEORGE starts to speak but HARRY is in there: jab. GEORGE
winces.)
There – see that? Blood.
(GEORGE starts to protest, to move.)
Hey – hold on, mouth open, head still – I don’t want to slip
with this little number.
(GEORGE freezes in alarm. HARRY starts to whistle softly.)
… Yes, Prudence is very particular about teeth. I’m sure
Mary’s the same. She’s got a lovely smile herself … Of
course, I’m not saying that teeth are a key to a man’s
character, but it’s the smile women look for. (He
withdraws.) I mean, that swine Collins had good teeth, I’ll
give him that, and he took Prudence in completely.

GEORGE: What?

HARRY: Oh – have I spoken out of turn? Well, it’s all water

under the bridge now.

GEORGE: What is?

HARRY: Collins – a trainee from the dental hospital. Nasty

piece of work. Thought I was an idiot.

GEORGE: Oh?

HARRY: 
Well, 
you 
know 
what 
Prudence 
is 
– 
very

impressionable, a bit young and dizzy, a sitting duck for a
bastard like Collins – I wouldn’t tell Mary about this, you
know, women don’t like each other to know when they’ve
made a bit of a fool of themselves – but there was a little
something between Prudence and Collins. Well, I didn’t
blame her, of course – I mean, she’s an innocent, really –
Collins took advantage of her. No, I just handled it my own
way.

GEORGE: Really?

HARRY: Oh yes. Collins wouldn’t be showing his face around

the fair sex for quite a while to come … and a real smiler,
he was. It was the craftiness I didn’t like. He was seducing
her right under my nose and he thought I couldn’t see. An
insult to my intelligence – that was it.

GEORGE: What did you –?

(HARRY has turned round, holding a syringe.)
What’s that?

HARRY: No point in causing unnecessary suffering, is there?

(GEORGE opens his mouth to protest.)
That’s it. (He puts in the needle.) We’ll just give it a
minute … Yes, well, I didn’t go to law, if that’s what you
mean. I could have done – oh yes, an open and shut case –
I could have sued him for thousands. But of course there
was no point – I mean, he wasn’t a man of substance. If
he’d been a man of substance, I wouldn’t have hesitated.
Thousands And the scandal. It would have ruined a man of
substance. How’s business?

GEORGE: What?

HARRY: Doing well? I always said to Prudence, George is a

man with a big future. Barring accidents. Oh yes.

GEORGE: Well, it’s all go. No time to myself for weeks.

HARRY: Of course it is. How’s the rowing?

GEORGE: The what?

HARRY: I thought you were a rowing man.

GEORGE: No, I wouldn’t say that.

HARRY: Oh, I thought you were a great one for the sculls on

the Serpentine.

GEORGE: Not me.

HARRY: Umm. Well … getting numb?

GEORGE: What? Oh – yes, I think so.

HARRY: Let’s have a look – (Probes.) Yes, funny business. I

mean, I had no reason to disbelieve it, because I know that
with Tuesday being Prudence’s free afternoon – (GEORGE
jerks.)
Sorry!
(HARRY withdraws.)
Better leave it a minute, then. (Sighs.) Who can one
believe, then?

GEORGE: Oh – of course – I’m with you – you mean on the

Serpentine with Prudence.

HARRY: That’s right.

GEORGE: Rowing!

HARRY: That’s what I said.

GEORGE: Yes – quite. I mean, it wasn’t actually rowing.

HARRY: No?

GEORGE: No – it was more in the nature of paddling.

HARRY: Ah.

GEORGE: Yes, I was in the Park, and you don’t often get a

chance to have a bit of a paddle – yes, I was just fixing up a
boat for myself – it was more a canoe, really – and lo! –
there was Prudence – ‘Hello,’ I said, ‘what are you doing
here?’ ‘Hello,’ she said, ‘fancy seeing you.’ ‘Fancy a
paddle,’ I said … Yes, she mentioned seeing me, did she?

HARRY: No, she didn’t mention it. It was Archie Sullivan.

GEORGE: Who?

HARRY: Archie Sullivan. Do you know him?

GEORGE: No, I don’t believe I do.

HARRY: Oh. He knows you.

GEORGE: Oh.

of a row on the Serpentine on her afternoon off work. I
can’t think what she was doing in the Park – though of
course she does have her activities as I told you.

GEORGE: Yes, it was the flowers, I think. Picking flowers. To

arrange.

HARRY: That’s funny.

GEORGE: Well, I suppose you have to bring your own – you

won’t find the local authorities lashing out the rates on
floral composition.

HARRY: No, but Tuesday is old people.

GEORGE: Oh – yes – She did have some old people with her.

Three or four. Very decent lot, I thought. Very clean and
well behaved.

HARRY: Did you have them in the boat?

GEORGE: No, they didn’t fancy it.

HARRY: Very nice.

GEORGE: What?

HARRY: Very nice, if you can get it. I don’t know how you do it.

Still getting your bit, then? On the job?

GEORGE: Now, Harry –

HARRY: No, I envy you – what a job! Lovely.

GEORGE: Oh, the job – Well, it’s very varied work, of course –

HARRY: Yes, you should have been on ‘What’s My Line?’

They’d never have guessed you, would they, not with your
mime. There you’d be rowing your boat – they’d never
guess Salesman in a million years. You’d have got a
diploma. (He has wandered off and has suddenly turned
round with a mallet and chisel. GEORGE sits bolt upright and
squawks –)

GEORGE: Harr!

(HARRY puts the chisel against the head-rest bracket and
gives it a good thump with the mallet.)

HARRY: Must get that seen to. (He puts down the mallet and

chisel.) 
Open up now. (Probes.) Yes, you won’t feel a thing.
(The drill; GEORGE’s eyes.)
Mmmm … (Whistles softly for a moment.) Incidentally,
when you and Mary come round could you bring
Prudence’s shoes with you.
(GEORGE’s eyes.)
Steady now. (Withdraws.)

GEORGE: What?

HARRY: Apparently she left them at your place after she fell in.

GEORGE: What are you talking about?

HARRY: Shoes. She left them behind. At your place after she

fell in. Of course, that’s my deduction, I may be wrong.

GEORGE: You are wrong, Harry. What are you trying to say? –

Prudence never came home without her shoes, did she?

HARRY: No, she was wearing Mary’s. Lucky thing you live so

close to the Park – she might have got pneumonia with her
shoes wet.

GEORGE: Mary’s shoes?

HARRY: Got Mary’s name in them. Same kind of shoes, only

with Mary’s name in them. Lucky they take the same size.
Must remember to thank her. Rinse please.
(GEORGE rinses and thinks.)

GEORGE: Oh – yes. Of course. Yes, it was when she was getting

out of the boat, she sort of –

HARRY: Fell in.

yes. ‘Tell you what,’ I said – ‘My place is very handy – I’ll
just nip up for a pair of Mary’s shoes for you to go home
in, don’t want to get pneumonia –’

HARRY: But she went with you, didn’t she?

GEORGE: Well, it seemed simpler, yes – cup of tea to warm her

up – footbath – Yes, you asked her about it, did you?

HARRY: No, I’ve hardly had a chance to speak to her. It was

Archie Sullivan who told me.

GEORGE: Oh? I must say, he gets about, doesn’t he? (Laugh.)

He ought to have been on ‘What’s My Line?’ if anyone –
with his mime – just following people about, they’d never
guess him in a million years.

HARRY: Oh, I don’t know. I mean, he’s a private enquiry agent,

isn’t he?

GEORGE: Is he?

HARRY: Well, he says he is. I don’t see why he should lie about

it.
(Up.) Mary!
(The door opens and the WIFE enters.)
Ah, Mary – this husband of yours is having a bit of trouble
after all –

WIFE: Not serious is it, Harry?

GEORGE: I meant to tell you, lover – you’d never guess who I

met in the Park –
(He finds his mouth full of drill.)

HARRY: (Drilling) Well, it’s not too good at all. He hasn’t been

taking care. I’m trying to save what I can.

But … (Withdraws.)
(GEORGE starts to speak.)
Spit.
(GEORGE rinses.)

GEORGE: Yes – I couldn’t get a taxi – traffic jams as far as you

could see – and I had to meet this big client – so I thought,
I know – I’ll cut through the Park – and of course I forgot
about the lake – bang in the way – so what do you think I
did? I’ll tell you –
(HARRY has returned with brush and liquid.)

HARRY: Now whatever you do, don’t move your head while I’m

doing this.

GEORGE: What does it do?

HARRY: Stains green – we don’t want to get it on your teeth,

but it’s very good for your gum condition, so I’m giving it a
try Ready?
(GEORGE freezes with mouth open. HARRY administers. The

WIFE mixes paste.)
… I was just saying, Mary – old George has a very
interesting job. Takes him into all sorts of places.

WIFE: Mostly pubs.

HARRY: Yes – and the lake.

WIFE: What lake?

HARRY: The Serpentine. You’ll never guess what he was doing

yesterday.

WIFE: Demonstrating a new line, he said.

HARRY: Ha-ha – that’s a new line – eh, George?

(GEORGE frozen.)
(MARY comes round to the front and notices the extractors.
She picks them up.)

MARY: Harry, you don’t mean –?

HARRY: Don’t worry – you won’t know the difference.

MARY: (Upset) It’s not the same, though, is it?

HARRY: Well, he should have thought of that in all these

months of neglect.

MARY: But he’s always brushing his teeth. He’s a maniac

about them.

HARRY: It’s the gums, Mary, it’s the gums. Oh – you moved,

George!
(He withdraws.)

Yes, he was on the lake, demonstrating –

GEORGE: Life-jackets. Have you got green on my teeth?

MARY: Life-jackets?

GEORGE: The new line. I was demonstrating it, rowing a boat

the client was worried about it causing restriction – He
was going to order a thousand as long as it didn’t interfere
with the rowing – that’s what he said – so I went out and –

MARY: Life-jackets. It was my birthday, too. He let me down,

you know.

HARRY: Tsk, tsk. You don’t know when you’re well off, George

a beautiful wife –

MARY: Oh really, Harry –

HARRY: Beautiful, I said – and on her birthday – if I was in

your shoes, George – oh, that reminds me – Ah! – you
moved again? Where was I?

MARY: Do you think I’m beautiful, really, Harry?

HARRY: I say it in front of George. A man would be proud to

have you for a wife.

MARY: Oh, Harry – isn’t he sweet, George? You see I’ve got

them on? [Earrings.]

HARRY: You do something for those earrings. They’re nothing

by themselves.

MARY: You’re flirting!

HARRY: Oh, I wouldn’t do it behind George’s back.

MARY: No, you don’t say much, Harry – but I did wonder (She

touches her earrings.)

Prudence for a boat-ride on the Serpentine yesterday.

MARY: He what?

GEORGE: (Free but strangled) Yes, I was demonstrating the life

jacket and it all went very well, and suddenly I saw
Prudence. Well, I took her for a paddle, just for a minute,
and when she was getting out of the boat she slipped and
fell in – I mean, got her shoes wet – so as it was cold, I
suggested that she borrowed a pair of yours so she
wouldn’t get pneumonia, and we nipped back to the flat
and she borrowed your shoes, I knew you wouldn’t mind,
of course –

HARRY: They all had a cup of tea.

MARY: All?

HARRY: She had some old people with her, according to

George.

GEORGE: Yes – three or four, very nice old people – we all had

a brew-up while Prudence was changing her shoes – cup of
tea and a piece of cake – me and Prudence and some old
folks, in the flat yesterday … I forgot to tell you.

HARRY: Old Pru certainly gets about. She’s never at home.

Just like George.

GEORGE: I meant to tell you – I say, Harry – you haven’t got

green on my teeth, have you?

HARRY: Only one of them – I told you not to move –

MARY: George –

HARRY: Don’t you worry – it’s lucky it’s that one –

GEORGE: Why? – what’s lucky about it?

(HARRY inserts a clamp: this is a fitting like a tiny girder –
the top and bottom hold apart the upper and lower jaw,
preventing GEORGE from closing his mouth, which is wide
open.)

HARRY: I’m afraid he won’t be needing it anyway.

MARY: Not that I care. Life-jackets.

HARRY: Fascinating job. Of course I’m very dull.

MARY: No, you’re not, Harry.

HARRY: Nothing very romantic about dentistry.

MARY: But you’re romantic at heart, Harry – that’s what

counts. You’re a gentleman.

HARRY: I’m glad you liked the earrings.

MARY: Did you choose them, Harry?

HARRY: Yes – I really looked around for those. Actually, I didn’t

get around to mentioning it to Prudence – didn’t want her
to get any ideas –

MARY: What ideas would she get, Harry?

(HARRY withdraws from GEORGE’s mouth. They go out of his
vision and their voices are off screen. We are left with

GEORGE’s eyes and gaping mouth.)

HARRY: Oh … ideas …

MARY: You don’t have ideas, do you Harry?

HARRY: Well, I’m only human. Aren’t we all? George and

Prudence and you are …

MARY: I’m only human –

HARRY: Of course you are, Mary … Are you sure those

earrings aren’t too tight –

MARY: Well, of course, being new …

HARRY: I was worried about that – there, does that pinch a bit

–

MARY: It’s slipped a bit, that’s what it is –

HARRY: This way?

MARY: No, the other way, Harry … if you just push my hair

back a little –

HARRY: Like this …?

MARY: Can you see …?

HARRY: Just turn your head a little –

MARY: Yes, Harry … that’s better … that’s nice …

(The dialogue runs down to silence while we stay on

GEORGE’s face. His eyes move right and left. He tries to
twist but he can’t see behind the head-rest.
Six or seven seconds of silence.
They come back into GEORGE’s view. Harry’s tie is almost
under his ear. Mary’s little white dental receptionist’s cap
is cock-eyed. HARRY, humming softly, fits the oxygen mask
over GEORGE’s face. Dissolve into FLORA and AGNES in the
waiting room. There are two or three new people in the
waiting room: old ill-kept faces. FLORA and AGNES are sitting
together as before.)

FLORA: Oh, I could have had him – just like that – (She snaps

her fingers) – he was begging me.

AGNES: I can see it now … On his knees.

FLORA: On his knees. I told him.

AGNES: You did.

FLORA: Straight out. I want a man who’s all there.

AGNES: A whole man –

FLORA: I’m not interested in half a man, I said –

AGNES: You’re right.

want the lot and I can get it. I said to him – I don’t care
about how you look without them – though he did look
horrible – that’s not the point, it’s the principle –

AGNES: That’s it, I wouldn’t have a man without them on

principle –

FLORA: Because if they’ve gone already, what’ll go next, I said.

AGNES: That’s the point.

FLORA: (Pause; sighs) Mind you, I was sorry. Six months later

mine turned black. I would’ve had anybody.
(They sigh.
The door to Mary’s office opens. MARY is there. Behind her

GEORGE comes out of the surgery into the office, followed
by HARRY. GEORGE is a stricken man.)

MARY: Er … who was next?

(AGNES and FLORA start telling each other to go first. 
We move through to GEORGE and HARRY.

GEORGE moves. MARY turns to let him go by, but in the
doorway –)
(Cool) Did you say you’d be late again tonight?

she does with all the dresses she makes …
(GEORGE is going.)
Oh – by the way – I was going to catch up on the
paperwork today – I was wondering if I could ask Mary to
stay behind a while – as she knows the ropes … Would you
mind, Mary –?

MARY: Oh no, that’ll be all right – George is out tonight, he’s

tied up.

HARRY: Well, take care, George – and don’t forget – daily

massage, get in there with the woodpoints.
(GEORGE turns to face the patients, who all stare at him
with blank faces. GEORGE lets out a thin smile which is
more like a wince. His middle tooth is missing. At this, all
the patients smile at him, as one of their own. All around
there are smiles like broken-down brooms.)

1. INT. BONE’S STUDY. DAY

BONE is working.

PENELOPE: (Off-camera, distant) Dah-ling!

(BONE takes no notice.)
Dah-ling….
(He has heard but won’t respond.)
Help! Fire! Murder!

BONE: (Murmurs) Wolf …

PENELOPE: Wolves! Look out!! Rape! Rape! Rape!

BONE: Not the most logical of misfortunes.

PENELOPE: Go away, you brute! Don’t force me! My husband

will kill us both!

BONE: I do not insist on plausibility –

PENELOPE: Because I love him.

BONE: Logic is all I ask.

PENELOPE: Oooooh … aaaah … I can’t fight you any more – It’s

too lovely – oh – don’t stop – ah – I don’t care if he comes
in –
(BONE weakens, cracks and breaks. He slams down his pen,
marches to her room.)

2. INT. PENELOPE’S ROOM. DAY

TV set shows ceremonial parade.

PENELOPE: I think you owe me an apology.

BONE: Penelope, you know I can’t have my work interrupted –

PENELOPE: Here you are, at the gallop – not bearing buckets of

water – by no means with a poker raised to my defence –

BONE: Where’s Pinkerton?

PENELOPE: – not a trace of aniseed dusted on your trousers to

lure away the pack – oh no –

BONE: For God’s sake –

PENELOPE: As far as you’re concerned, credibility begins with

the thought of my unfaithfulness –

BONE: Penelope –

PENELOPE: How dare you?

BONE: I’m sorry –

PENELOPE: If that’s what you think of me –

BONE: I don’t – not for a moment did I think –

(They have been competing with the television music. BONE
turns it off. The music continues, fainter, but more real.)

PENELOPE: Do you mind? there’s going to be a commentary –

(BONE goes to the window. The music drifts up. BONE stares
down.)

BONE: A parade …

PENELOPE: A parade …! Where’ve you been for the last ten

days?

BONE: Oh yes … the moon man. He’s come back …

PENELOPE: The moon man? You make him sound like a piece of

cheese. Don’t you see he was the first? He’s changed
everything.

BONE: Well, he didn’t discover it, after all. We all knew it was

there. Nor did he have to navigate. He just – sat, really.
And somebody had to be first. One thing leads to another;
the last thing led to the moon. Logic. (Peering out) I can’t
see him … He must come near the end …

PENELOPE: You’re such a fool – you should be down there

cheering with all the rest. Can’t you see he’s smashed
through?
(BONE closes the window. He turns back from the window.)

BONE: A cargo. He might have been a piece of cheese. He

used to be a monkey. Before that he was a television
camera. Now he is a man – but still a cargo. He sat. What
else did he do?

feet on solid ground, and brought everything into question
– because up till then the world was all there was – and
always had been – it was us and we were it – and every
assumption was part of the world which was all there was,
and is no longer –
(He stares at her, uncomprehending.)

BONE: What did you want me for?

PENELOPE: I can’t remember.

BONE: Well, I’ll …

PENELOPE: I can’t remember.

BONE: Well, I’ll …

(PENELOPE remembers.)

PENELOPE: The window …

(BONE goes to the window and opens it.)
I wanted you to close the window …
(BONE goes back and closes it.)

BONE: Penelope, I’ve go to get on with my work.

PENELOPE: History! Do you think history matters now?

BONE: I do not write history, I dissect it – lay bare the logic

which other men have taken to be an arbitrary sequence of
accidents.

PENELOPE: Read me what you’ve done today.

BONE: You think in quantities. I am not a typist.

PENELOPE: You don’t care that I’m ill.

BONE: Where’s Pinkerton?

PENELOPE: I don’t know.

BONE: It’s her job to look after you.

PENELOPE: I let her go out to watch the parade.

BONE: She would have had a better view from the window.

(He moves.)

PENELOPE: Play with me – just till Albert comes.

BONE: Is he coming again?

PENELOPE: Why shouldn’t he come?

BONE: Why should he?

PENELOPE: You resent me having visitors?

BONE: You don’t have visitors. You have Albert. He never

comes to see me.

PENELOPE: There’s nothing the matter with you.

BONE: I don’t like him.

PENELOPE: You don’t know him.

BONE: So you entertain a man I don’t even know?

PENELOPE: Entertain?

BONE: What am I supposed to think?

PENELOPE: What do you think?

BONE: I make no judgements. I’m asking you.

PENELOPE: Asking me what?

BONE: What would you think in my position?

PENELOPE: I don’t think I like your tone. Albert is a very dear

friend, and it is natural that I should ask him to come and
see me. You have never bothered to emerge from your
cave to introduce yourself and now you ask why you don’t
know him.

BONE: I can put two and two together, you know. Do not think

you are dealing with a man who has lost his grapes.
Putting two and two together is my speciality. I did not fail
to notice it when you began to receive visits from a
handsome stranger who arrived once or twice a week with
an air of quiet expectation, to leave an hour later looking
more than a little complacent –

PENELOPE: Albert’s been coming to see me for months.

BONE: I did not leap to any hasty conclusion – I do not deal in

appearances, suspicions or wild surmise. I bide my time
and examine the evidence. But ten days ago you took to
your bed and remained there for no reason that has
declared itself, while at the same time, the stranger, Albert
by name, began calling every day. So I think it’s time we
had this out. There is no doubt a logical explanation.
(Starts to pace.) We have on the one hand, that is to say in
bed, an attractive married lady whose relations with her
husband are, at their highest, polite, and have been for
some time. We have, on the other hand, daily visits by a
not unhandsome stranger who rings the doorbell, is
admitted by Pinkerton and shown into the lady’s bedroom,
whence he emerges an hour or so later and lets himself
out. Now let’s see, does anything suggest itself? Wife in
bed, daily visits by stranger. What inference may one
draw?

PENELOPE: Sounds to me that he’s the doctor.

BONE: Doctor?

PENELOPE: What the hell did you think he was?

BONE: You mean you’re ill?

PENELOPE: Good grief …

BONE: But he came before and you weren’t ill then.

PENELOPE: How do you know? Perhaps I was being brave. You

don’t care! All you can do is accuse me –

BONE: Really, Penelope, I never –

PENELOPE: How could you –?

BONE: I made no accusations – I merely –

PENELOPE: You don’t care that I’m not well –

BONE: How was I supposed to know you weren’t well! I didn’t

know he was a doctor.
(She turns on the TV.)

TV COMMENTATOR: … and what a magnificent occasion it is! Not

even the rain can dampen the spirit here today as the
people of London pay their homage to the lunanaut … and
here comes the second rank of the Household Cavalry – I
can see the glint of their brass as they come up out of
Whitehall into the square, followed by the massed bands of
the Royal Air Force – Well, we still have some way to go
before the high point of the procession, the golden capsule
itself, reaches us here at – And here comes the fly-past of –
(Jets roar in and whine away.

BONE heads for the door. PENELOPE switches off the set.)

PENELOPE: Darling … play with me …

BONE: I can’t … I’m so behind …

PENELOPE: Oh, play with me.

(The jets reach the house, roar overhead and whine away.)

BONE: You don’t mean –? Do you mean? – Oh, Penelope …

(He reaches for her. She disengages herself peevishly.)

PENELOPE: Oh, stop it! I meant play games.

BONE: Games.

PENELOPE: Amuse me. Jolly me along.

BONE: That’s what Pinkerton’s for.

PENELOPE: I got rid of her. Actually.

BONE: What do you mean?

PENELOPE: Gave her the push.

BONE: You didn’t.

PENELOPE: This morning.

BONE: Why?

PENELOPE: Sudden impulse.

BONE: You can’t.

PENELOPE: Did.

BONE: You must have had a reason.

PENELOPE: Felt like it.

BONE: A reason –

PENELOPE: Thirty-four years – suddenly it was quite enough.

BONE: She was your nanny – part of the family –

PENELOPE: Serve her right.

BONE: You can’t just throw your old nanny into the street!

PENELOPE: Did. Well, she always won.

BONE: Won what?

PENELOPE: Everything! Every damn thing. Cards, noughts and

crosses, charades – she had a mean winning streak, old

Pinkers, so out she went.

BONE: I’m shocked.

psychology of being a patient – but oh no! ‘Oh, Penny, look
at me, I’ve won again!’

BONE: What was behind it? – No such thing as pure impulse –

Yes, I’m shocked. And you need someone – I can’t stop to –
If you’re going to stay in bed there’s got to be someone –

PENELOPE: Albert will get me somebody. Albert would do

anything for me.

BONE: Why, what do you do for him?

PENELOPE: Play with me.

BONE: What exactly is the matter with you?

PENELOPE: It hasn’t got a name yet. I’m the first person to

have it.

BONE: Measles? Yellow fever? Gastroenteritis? – what’s the

matter with you?

PENELOPE: Nothing, in here. I’m all right in bed.

BONE: I’ve got to work.

PENELOPE: Tell me about it!

BONE: Tell you …?

PENELOPE: Entrance me! What are you on now?

BONE: I’m still on the Greeks.

PENELOPE: 
The 
Greeks! 
Warriors 
and 
poets! 
Lovers!

Philosophers! Extending knowledge and empire – the rule
of law and democracy! – sculptors in marble and gods in
the image of man!

BONE: Yes, those Greeks.

PENELOPE: How far have you got?

BONE: The third century.

PENELOPE: You’re catching up!

BONE: BC.

PENELOPE: Oh. But you’ve done the Etruscans.

BONE: Yes.

PENELOPE: The Etruscans! Mysterious shadows in the warm

Italian stones that guard the secret of a vanished culture –
a civilization under the olive hills!

BONE: (Rises) Which explains nothing.

PENELOPE: Play! Here then – just one go. [Pencils and paper.]

I’ll be crosses, you be noughts.

BONE: Are you better today?

PENELOPE: I’m keeping my spirits up. Albert says that’s the

main thing.

BONE: Do you like him?

PENELOPE: He’s all right in his way.

BONE: What way is that?

PENELOPE: Oh, you know.

BONE: No. What does he do?

PENELOPE: He’s a doctor.

BONE: I mean –

PENELOPE: Three crosses! I won. You’re better than Pinkerton.

BONE: I thought –

her. (BONE looks at her.)
Only teasing, darling. Again!

BONE: Why does he bring you flowers?

PENELOPE: I’m a private patient.

BONE: You must be paying him a fortune.

PENELOPE: I’ve got a fortune.

BONE: Well, you never earned it, any more than me!

your daddy earned it. Your go.

BONE: What does he do to you, Albert?

PENELOPE: 
He 
keeps 
my 
spirits 
up. 
My 
trouble 
is

psychosomatic, you see.

BONE: Is it?

PENELOPE: Yes. I haven’t actually got it, you see.

BONE: Got what!

PENELOPE: I’ve just got the symptoms.

BONE: Hysterical.

PENELOPE: Hilarious.

BONE: I meant –

sank my entire fleet in three minutes. That’s really what
did it, you know.

BONE: I think you should get up.

PENELOPE: I can’t. I’ve lost the use of my legs.

(She is preparing battleship papers.)

BONE: That was very sudden.

PENELOPE: No it wasn’t. It was very gradual. There, that’s

yours. Mark it one to eight down and A to H across. You’re
allowed four submarines, three destroyers, two cruisers
and an aircraft-carrier. Put them anywhere you like.

BONE: I know how to play. (He marks his paper.) If you’re not

going to get any better we’ll have to change your doctor.

PENELOPE: There’s no question of my getting better. I can only

hope to hold my own.

BONE: Does he ever mention me?

PENELOPE: Mmmmmm, he says you’re only half a man.

BONE: That’s a filthy lie and you know it! – I am constantly

repulsed –

PENELOPE: … because every time he comes, he sees half of

you, peering through the door. C-four.

BONE: What?

PENELOPE: C-four. Have I hit anything?

BONE: Oh. No.

PENELOPE: Your go.

BONE: B-six.

PENELOPE: No. G-two.

BONE: Submarine.

PENELOPE: Pow! Starboard torpedo away, sir! … Boom!

(Distant gun booms.)
We’ve got her! By George, we’ve got her! The sea is
boiling and here she comes up like a great wounded
whale, and the conning tower flies open and little men are
jumping into the sea! Depth charges! Let go number one!
Let go number two! – Boom!
(Distant gun again.

BONE rises.
Third gun.)

BONE: What was that?

PENELOPE: The salute … Now they’re saluting him …

(Music in.)

BONE: Are they going round the block?

PENELOPE: No! – the procession is miles long. They’ve got

eighteen different military bands and then there’s the
tanks and everything, and the rocket-carrier with the
capsule and the lunanaut … I want to see him – his face – I
want to see if it shows, what he has seen.

BONE: What?

PENELOPE: God, is it only me? I tell you, he has stood outside

and seen us whole, all in one go, little. And suddenly
everything we live by – our rules – our good, our evil – our
ideas of love, duty – all the things we’ve counted on as
being absolute truths – because we filled all existence –
they’re all suddenly exposed as nothing more than local
customs nothing more – because he has seen the edges
where we stop, and we never stopped anywhere before –

BONE: Penelope –

PENELOPE: I’m telling you – when that thought drips through

to the bottom, people won’t just carry on. The things
they’ve taken on trust, they’ve never had edges before.
(Jets scream over the house and whine away into the
distance.)

BONE: Oh come on now … Er, G-five.

PENELOPE: Nothing. H-three.

BONE: Nothing. A-four.

PENELOPE: Nothing. B-seven.

BONE: Nothing. E-six.

PENELOPE: Nothing. C-two.

BONE: Nothing. D-four.

(He has scored, it’s on her face. Horror.
The doorbell rings.)

PENELOPE: Ding-ding-ding!

Alarm stations, alarm stations! We’ve been hit – We’re
blowing up – Don’t jump! – don’t jump – the sea’s on fire.
(She throws herself back on the bed, hiding her face. 
The doorbell rings again. 
She lifts her face, smiling.)
That was close! Don’t let him in till I’m ready.

3. INT. HALL. DAY

BONE opens the front door, ALBERT is there, carrying
an expensive bunch of flowers.

ALBERT: Good morning.

BONE: Good morning. Miss Pinkerton isn’t here today.

ALBERT: I’ve come to see Mrs Bone.

BONE: Yes, I know. I was just saying Miss Pinkerton isn’t here

today, that’s all. I thought you might have been wondering

why she didn’t open the door today.

ALBERT: Yes, I was wondering.

BONE: Well, she isn’t here today.

ALBERT: Ah.

BONE: Well, this way! She won’t keep you a moment.

4. INT. BONE’S STUDY. DAY

BONE: I’m Mrs Bone’s husband.

ALBERT: Mr Bone.

BONE: Yes … Yes, I’m something of a logician myself.

ALBERT: Really? Sawing ladies in half – that kind of thing?

BONE: Logician. Well, sit down, sit down! My wife speaks very

highly of you.

ALBERT: And I’m very fond of her.

ALBERT and BONE: (Together) How is she?

BONE: Well, you’re the doctor – how am I supposed to know

how she is? She doesn’t tell me anything. The first day she
stayed in bed I thought she’d had a bad night, and the next
day I thought – lazy old thing! – and – well, it’s just gone
on and on and there’s no end to it. All she’ll say is, she’s all
right in bed.

ALBERT: Yes, well, there’s something in that.

BONE: You think so? I understand you’re a good friend of hers.

ALBERT: Thank you. Is this where you do your work?

BONE: What? – Oh … yes. Yes, this is where I’m getting it all

down. It’s an immense undertaking of course –
(ALBERT is regarding the unkempt bed, turning over the
blanket with his stick.)
Yes – I bunk down in here – the midnight oil, you know –
I’ve been bunking down in here since – well, it’s my life’s
work of course.

ALBERT: Your life’s work!

BONE: Yes. How long would you say I’ve got?

ALBERT: Are you inviting tenders?

BONE: No – just a professional estimate.

ALBERT: Well, I’d say as long as you’ve had.

BONE: (Appalled) Is that all? But I’m not half-way yet – not

nearly.

ALBERT: What do you write?

BONE: It’s sort of history.

ALBERT: What of?

BONE: The world.

ALBERT: The history of the world! How far have you got?

BONE: I’m doing the Greeks at the moment, third century.

ALBERT: Broken the back of them.

BONE: BC. But I’ve done the Etruscans.

ALBERT: Found plenty of new stuff, have you?

BONE: Well no, I mean practically nothing is known about the

Etruscans. You see, I’m not exactly a historian – the actual
history has all been written up by other people – but I’m
discovering the patterns – exposing the fallacy of chance –
there are no impulsive acts – nothing random – everything
is logical and connects into the grand design.

ALBERT: Is there one?

BONE: There’s got to be something going on beside a lot of

accidents. If it’s all random, then what’s the point?

ALBERT: What’s the point if it’s all logical?

BONE: I hadn’t meant to do a history of the world, only of

myself 
… 
but 
the 
thing 
keep 
spreading, 
making

connections back, wider and deeper all the time, the real
causes, and suddenly I knew that everything I did was the
culminating act of a sequence going back to Babylon …

PENELOPE: (Off-camera) Dah-ling …

good end to your book.

BONE: The lunanaut?

ALBERT: The logical place to stop, I would have thought. The

day man bridged the cosmic gap. That was the day she
took to her bed, you know.
(BONE reacts.)

PENELOPE: (Off-camera) Dah-ling!

ALBERT: Well, if you’ll excuse me –

BONE: (Blocking his way) What exactly do you do in there?

ALBERT: Well, I … examine her.

BONE: She won’t let me examine her! You must have a good

time, examining people.

ALBERT: Well, it’s different for us medical men, you know. You

think that when I’m examining Penelope –

BONE: Penelope?

ALBERT: Her name is Penelope, isn’t it?

BONE: Yes.

ALBERT: She told me it was. You think that when I’m

examining Penelope I see her eyes as cornflowers, her lips
as rubies, her skin so soft and warm as milk … you think
that when I run my hands over her back I am carried away
by the delicate contours that flow like a sea shore from
shoulder to heel – Oh, I know, dear fellow! – you think my
mind turns to ripe pears as soon as I press those firm pink
–

BONE: No, I don’t!

ALBERT: But it’s misconception. To us medical men the human

body is an imperfect machine constructed from cells,
tissues, organs …

PENELOPE: (Off-camera) Help! Fire, murder!

ALBERT: Funny thing, I knew a fellow called Bone once – I

wonder if he was a relation? Yes, he wanted to be an
osteopath but he couldn’t face the pleasantries –

5. INT. HALL. DAY

ALBERT: – which every patient would have felt obliged to

make, so he took his wife’s maiden name of Foot and now
practises in Frinton as a chiropodist. My name is Pearce.
Albert Pearce.

PENELOPE: (Off-camera) Rape! Rape! Rape!

ALBERT: I believe she’s ready for me.

(The doorbell rings. 

ALBERT enters the bedroom, closing the door. 

BONE answers the front doo. CROUCH is standing there.)

BONE: Yes?

CROUCH: Crouch, sir. Hall porter downstairs.

BONE: Is the lift out of order?

CROUCH: No sir, it’s another matter I’ve come about.

BONE: You look as if you could do with a sit-down.

CROUCH: You’re right sir, thank you sir – it’s a long haul.

BONE: Come this way. Did you want to see me?

CROUCH: Well, I’m seeing everybody, sir, making enquiries.

You know what happened out there?

BONE: The parade?

6. INT. BONE’S STUDY. DAY

CROUCH: The incident. There’s been a bit of an incident. (He

sags into a chair.) Woman, middle-aged to elderly, five foot
one, grey hair in a bun, blue dress, starched apron, fell in
the street. Dead.

BONE: Oh … yes?

CROUCH: I’ve seen her coming in and out, but I’ve drawn a

blank at the other flats. No one missing of that description
here, sir?

BONE: Pinkerton …

CROUCH: Ah.

BONE: Oh dear … A small old-looking grey-haired lady in a

white apron?

CROUCH: (Takes off his peaked cap) Relative, sir?

BONE: My wife’s nanny.

CROUCH: I’ve got to make a bit of a report, you see.

BONE: Yes … I’d better go and break the news … she’ll be

most upset.

CROUCH: Right, sir. I’ll wait here.

(BONE goes out.)

7. INT. HALL. DAY

BONE crosses hall, goes into bedroom.

8. INT. PENELOPE’S ROOM. DAY

PENELOPE is sitting up in bed. ALBERT is kneeling on
the bed, kissing her chastely. He releases her and
kneels back. They take no notice of BONE.

PENELOPE: Do that last bit again.

(He kisses her.)
Pray-kiss?

ALBERT: No.

PENELOPE: Start again, from the beginning.

Tip-toe?
Slow?

ALBERT: (A clue) Ssssh!

PENELOPE: Quiet? Soft?

(ALBERT nods.)

Soft?
(ALBERT grabs her.)
Grab?

ALBERT: As if you were running away.

PENELOPE: Catch!

ALBERT: Y!

PENELOPE: Catchy?

(He prays.)
Priest? Pray? Monk?
(He nods.)
Monk!
(ALBERT kisses her.)

BONE: Softly softly catchee monkey.

ALBERT: Correct!

PENELOPE: Shut up! He spoilt it! What do you want?

BONE: Pinkerton’s dead.

ALBERT: Dead!

BONE: There’s a man come to make a report.

PENELOPE: What does he want to know?

BONE: I don’t know.

PENELOPE: Well, it’s a fat lot of good asking me, then, isn’t it?

BONE: Monk-key. In the singular. Softly softly catchee monkey.

Not monkiss.

ALBERT: Mr Bone, this is intolerable! I will not be interrupted

in this frivolous manner while I’m bringing aid and comfort
to a patient!
(BONE retreats, closing the door.)

9. INT. BONE’S STUDY. DAY

In the study CROUCH is looking at one of Bone’s
notebooks.

CROUCH: The Etruscans soon fizzled out, didn’t they? I mean,

there wasn’t much to them. I never thought much of Eye-
talians, mind you …

BONE: (Briskly) Mr Crouch, how exactly can we help you

regarding this matter of Pinkerton’s death? She was an old
lady, rather frail. She fell down, fractured something
perhaps – and died. It’s very sad, but she had a splendid
life in the best houses – what else can one say?

CROUCH: I thought you might know how it happened.

BONE: I thought she fell in the street?

CROUCH: From the window. We were all watching the parade

and suddenly, behind us – thump … Amazing to think
where he’s been, the lunatic …
(But BONE is already marching back to the bedroom.)

10. INT. HALL. DAY

BONE crosses hall to bedroom.

11. INT. PENELOPE’S ROOM. DAY

BONE storms in and stops dead.
No one is in sight. The drapes are drawn round the
bed. Albert’s shoes, sticky hat and cape are lying
neatly outside, on chair.

PENELOPE: (Inside) Who is it?

BONE: Me. How is she?

(PENELOPE’s head and bare shoulder appears.)

PENELOPE: What?

BONE: I was asking how you were.

PENELOPE: What do you want?

BONE: He says Pinkerton fell from the window.

PENELOPE: Who does?

BONE: He says –

PENELOPE: I wish you’d shut up about Pinkerton! Go away!

(She ducks back inside.)

BONE: Well, it must have been your window – it’s the only one

overlooking … You can’t hide!

PENELOPE: Hee hee hee, can’t see me!

BONE: Who gave Pinkerton the push?

ALBERT: (Within) Say ninety-nine.

PENELOPE: Ninety-nine, doctor.

ALBERT: Feel any pain … there?

PENELOPE: No … no …

ALBERT: There?

PENELOPE: That’s closer … down a bit … Yes, yes … Oh yes,

that’s it … yes, yes … yes … oh yes …
(BONE retires.)

12. INT. HALL. DAY

BONE crosses.

13. INT. BONE’S STUDY. DAY

BONE: My wife’s in bed with the doctor at the moment, Mr …

CROUCH: Crouch, sir. I see you’re a historical man. I’ve got a

historical turn of mind myself. Have you read The Last of
the Wine?

BONE: Mr Crouch, let us not draw any hasty conclusions, let

us be logical. Firstly, you say Miss Pinkerton fell from the
window. Secondly, there is only one window overlooking
the parade. Therefore – thirdly, my wife has lost the use of
her legs, so – fourthly – Why didn’t you take the lift, as a
matter of interest?

CROUCH: Ah, well, I was calling at every floor, you see, and it

was always a case of just one more – but you’re right, sir, it
does build up on you.

BONE: You could have taken the lift to the top and worked

your way down.

CROUCH: By God, that’s a brainwave you’ve got there.

BONE: Thank you. As you can see, I’m a cerebral man. I-fifthly,

Miss Pinkerton was in service with my wife’s family for
thirty-four years and well loved – a second mother almost,
certainly third or fourth – fifthly – sixthly – it’s unthinkable.

CROUCH: Yes, it’s a truly wonderful era, sir, for brains – they

get you right to the top – take the loony – he’s put us out of
date –

BONE: Therefore –

CROUCH: Ah!

(ALBERT has appeared, perfectly dressed once mare.)

ALBERT: Is this the fellow?

CROUCH: Good morning, sir.

ALBERT: Splendid. You examined the body?

(He takes out a pad of certificates and starts scribbling.)

CROUCH: I did have a look.

ALBERT: Well done. Eyes dilated?

CROUCH: Could well have been.

ALBERT: Excellent. Heart stoppage?

CROUCH: Not a flutter.

ALBERT: Adds up. Any signs of vertigo?

CROUCH: Well, she fell a long way.

ALBERT: Quite agree.

(He tears off certificate, hands it to CROUCH.)
Put yourself in my hands. No point in casting a shadow
over a day of triumph.

CROUCH: Oh yes, sir – we better hurry if we want to see him.

14. INT. HALL. DAY

They move towards front door.

BONE: Just a minute –

ALBERT: Ah – yes, I think she’s out of danger now. The main

thing is – keep her amused. Humour her – plenty of fruit
drinks – that kind of thing –

BONE: You think I’m a fool, don’t you?

ALBERT: Mr Bone, medicine has many forms not given to the

layman to understand – but we medical men have given up
our youth to learn its mysteries and you must put your
trust in us.

BONE: There’s nothing wrong with her. When’s she going to

get up?

ALBERT: Get up? My dear fellow, Penelope can’t get up. She’s

unable to leave her bed. I’m sorry, there’s nothing I can do.
She’ll never walk again.
(Briskly to CROUCH:) Come along, let’s get this matter tidied
up.
(They leave.

BONE walks to bedroom door.)

15. INT. PENELOPE’S ROOM. DAY

Sound of parade, cheering.
PENELOPE is standing by the window, watching the
parade. She does not look round.

PENELOPE: There he goes … standing so straight and

handsome in his yellow uniform … There goes God in his
golden capsule. You’d think that he was sane, to look at
him, but he doesn’t smile because he has seen the whole
thing for what it is – not the be-all and end-all any more,

but just another moon called Earth – part of the works and
no rights to say what really goes – he’s made it all random.

BONE: She was your nanny.

PENELOPE: Poor Pinkers. You think I’m just a bad loser – but

no one is safe now.

BONE: You can’t hush it up, you know. And what about me?

There’s the law – accessory after the fact. You can’t flout
the laws – and nor can Albert.

PENELOPE: (Fondly) Huh – him and his ripe pears …

BONE: And don’t think I don’t know what’s going on!

PENELOPE: Nobody knows except me, and him; so far. Albert

almost knows. You’ll never know. There he goes … (She
smiles. Waves her hand slightly at the lunanaut below.)
Hello …
(The parade fades into the distance.)

1. EXT. OPEN COUNTRY. DAY. WINTER

An establishing shot of a passenger train.

2. INT. TRAIN. DAY

The compartment is full, six passengers. Four of
them are ‘LOCALS’, including one pretty GIRL. The
fifth is COMISKY, an American salesman. The sixth is
PHILO, who is distinguished from the others by his air
of slightly nervous reserve; by his clothes, which
suggest a bureaucratic correctness despite being
offset by a fur hat; and by his tiny pet monkey, which
peeps from his overcoat pocket. It seems like a party,
and COMISKY is the life and soul of it. The chatter of
the LOCALS is in a foreign tongue. A bottle is passed
round. Fruit and bread rolls are being shared. Only
PHILO abstains. COMISKY concentrates on the GIRL,
who is wearing a fur hat much like Philo’s.
COMISKY takes her hat and puts it on his head. He
prevents her from snatching it back.

COMISKY: I will take you home to America. I love you. Mrs

Comisky will learn to love you, give her time. (He brushes
aside interruptions and defends the hat.) I love you. Is this
man your husband? Forget him. (He kisses her hand
gallantly. She snatches her hat back. He takes a swig from
a proffered bottle.) OK, at least let me take your hat to
America. I want to buy the hat. I always wanted a fur hat.
(He takes out his wallet and from the wallet a note. The
gesture is misunderstood. Ribald laughter and protest.
The GIRL slaps him lightly.

PHILO interrupts for the first time – tells the girl briefly, in
her language, that the man just wants the hat. At this
point two uniformed officials, TRAIN POLICE, enter and the

LOCALS obviously know them well. Tickets and travel
documents are offered. The cramped compartment is alive
with chatter, the TRAIN POLICE joining in. The GIRL puts up

with the flirting. Philo’s document is obviously ‘special’ – it
consists of several items, passport, letter, photo, identity
card. The attitude of the TRAIN POLICE changes into one of
nervous respect, which rapidly infects the other people,
except COMISKY, who remains oblivious until he is the only
person left talking. COMISKY falls silent and looks round
blankly.)
Whassamatter …?
(The OFFICIALS salute PHILO and leave. PHILO strokes his
monkey, and looks embarrassed.)

3. EXT. FRONTIER STATION. DAY

A small frontier post, not even a village.
At one platform a train is waiting to leave, just
beyond a guarded gate.
A few people in view, several in uniform.
In the distance our first train is approaching.

4. INT. TRAIN. SAME TIME

Only 
COMISKY 
AND 
PHILO 
are 
left 
in 
the

compartment. PHILO drinks from a small bottle of
spirits, emptying it.

COMISKY: You’re coming all the way?

PHILO: Yes.

COMISKY: Sam Comisky – the New Jersey Comiskys, capitalists

– except the laundromat failed. You been in there on a
trip?

PHILO: Yes.

COMISKY: It’s a tight country for a salesman. I’m in and out.

(The train brakes and slows.)
The frontier. All change. I’ll be glad to get back into
Austria. How long was your visit?

PHILO: Fifteen years. Do you have by any chance some

Austrian money – a coin for the public telephone?
(COMISKY looks at him in surprise but fishes a fistful of
coins out of his pocket.)

COMISKY: Probably. There, how’s that?

(He gives PHILO a coin.)

PHILO: Thank you. May I also make you a gift?

(PHILO takes off his fur hat and offers it to COMISKY.)

COMISKY: Really?… Well, gee thanks.

5. EXT. FRONTIER STATION. DAY

PHILO, with no luggage except a briefcase, hatless
now, gets off the train and walks rapidly towards the
guarded gate, towards the waiting train. Amid the
other passengers 
COMISKY 
follows, 
carrying 
a

suitcase and the hat. He stops and puts the hat on.
The monkey climbs out of Philo’s pocket, up his coat.
An ASSASSIN is scanning the passengers, uncertainly,
not sure of himself.
PHILO is at the gate.
The monkey with a little squeal jumps off PHILO and
scampers up COMISKY, comically-angrily pulling at
his hat. COMISKY laughs.
The monkey sits on 
COMISKY’s shoulder. The

ASSASSIN sees COMISKY and the monkey now.
The ASSASSIN produces a machine-pistol and starts
shooting from close range. It takes one long burst
and then COMISKY and the monkey are dead on the
platform.
PHILO takes that in at a glance and turns swiftly
through the gate, unnoticed. The passengers and
GUARDS, etc. scatter, some towards the corpse.
PHILO pulls himself up into the waiting train.

6. INT. STATION OFFICE. SAME TIME

Two GUARDS stand nervously, holding guns, watching
the ASSASSIN. The ASSASSIN holds the phone to his
ear and waits, drumming his fingers on a piece of
paper on the table. The paper is a snapshot, a long-
range blow-up of PHILO with the monkey on his

shoulder. Behind the ASSASSIN, the train with PHILO
on it can be seen leaving the station.

7. INT. RAILWAY STATION. DAY

Establish Vienna Station. Philo’s train arriving.

8. INT. VIENNA STATION. SAME TIME

PHILO disembarks from the train.
He is being covertly watched by two or three men.
One of the men is SANDERS; another, OTIS.

9. INT. VIENNA STATION. SAME TIME

PHILO 
studies 
the 
phone, 
etc., 
reading 
the

instructions, holding Comisky’s coin.
Cutaway: SANDERS and OTIS watching.
PHILO dials.

TELEPHONE: Toytown International.

PHILO: Toytown? Thank you. I want the Sales Director in

charge of train sets.
(A hand comes over PHILO’s shoulder and cuts off the call.

PHILO turns and sees SANDERS.)

SANDERS: I’m out.

(OTIS’s head joins him in the frame.)
This is Mr Otis of Model Aeroplanes. He’s taken over
Exports.

10. CREDITS

11. EXT. SMALL RAILWAY STATION. DAY

A third railway station. (The film is to end on a
railway station, and this plethora of stations is
intended to top and tail the whole; thus it is hoped
that a virtue is made of the repetition.) This station is
Montebianca, clearly not much of a place.
A train has just arrived. Two men get off it: they will

be referred to as LAUREL and HARDY, whom they
resemble in shape though not in amiability.
LAUREL and HARDY each carry a small suitcase. They
move slowly and deliberately, taking in the station as
though it were a hotel room.

12. EXT. STATION BOOKSTALL. SAME TIME

LAUREL picks up a Guide to Montebianca.

13. EXT. PAVEMENT CAFE. DAY

LAUREL and HARDY sit at a table. LAUREL reads the
guidebook. HARDY sits with his fingers on a closed
file lying in front of him on the table. They are in the
same clothes as before – town suits, town shoes,
collars and ties, but slightly shabby. No suitcase now.

LAUREL: (Reading) ‘The population of Montebianca is sixteen

thousand, five hundred.’
(He looks around the café, where a handful of people are
sitting.) Sixteen thousand, four hundred and ninety-two to
go.
(The WAITER comes with their order of drinks, which he
places on top of the file. HARDY carefully puts the drinks to
one side.)

HARDY: My friend, perhaps you can help me a little.

(HARDY turns over the cover of the file, revealing a formal
photo of PHILO, and a banknote.)     I will be quite frank
with you
It is a little matter of a runaway husband. An old story.
Maybe he is a customer here?
(The WAITER examines the photo.)
It is not recent. He’s missing for two years.

WAITER: Yes. Maybe I can help you a little.

(HARDY gives him the banknote. The WAITER puts it in his
jacket pocket.)
Yes, I can help you. Here he is definitely not a customer.
(The WAITER smiles and goes about his business. LAUREL
shakes his head.)

LAUREL: Sixteen thousand … Well, sooner or later they will all

walk past this table.

HARDY: Our orders are forty-eight hours.

LAUREL: Orders.

(A couple stroll past the table.)
Sixteen thousand, four hundred and ninety.

HARDY: Does it say how many bars?

LAUREL: (Looking through the guidebook) Probably 
a

hundred.
(HARDY downs his drink, closes the file and stands up.)

HARDY: You see? The odds improve.

(LAUREL also finishes his drink. HARDY moves out, having dropped
some money on the table. 
LAUREL makes a small detour

towards the WAITER, who is balancing a laden tray on the tips
of his fingers. HARDY approaches him smiling, dips his  hand
into the waiter’s pocket and retrieves the banknote. With
 his other hand he delicately flicks the tray, sending it
crashing to  the floor.)

LAUREL: Don’t play games.

(He turns and follows HARDY away.)

14. MONTAGE OF THREE BAR INTERIORS

LAUREL and HARDY are having no success in their
search for PHILO. Barmen and serving girls, etc. are
shown the photo but it means nothing to them.

15. INT. BAR

LAUREL: Why would he come here anyway?

HARDY: To drink.

LAUREL: No, to Montebianca. It’s nothing, it’s too small, it’s

not a country, it’s a joke.

HARDY: Yes, it’s a funny place.

LAUREL: It’s a joke with postage stamps. Who wants it?

HARDY: Tourists. The mountains … very beautiful, they say,

LAUREL: Let’s go. Maybe he’s stopped drinking. Two years is a

long time – many things about him must have changed.

HARDY: No, he drinks. I know them. Besides, what else do we

know of him? Did you read the file? Half a sheet. How can

we work from half a sheet on a whole man?

(HARDY looks around absently and notices at an adjoining
table an oldish man playing with a white kitten. HARDY
pauses on that.)
Zut!

16. INT. VETERINARY SURGERY. DAY

A cat in a cage. Then a line of cages containing
puppies, birds, mice, etc., with which LAUREL is
trying to ingratiate himself.
LAUREL and HARDY are alone in the room. The door
opens and a NURSE in white enters.

NURSE: No, I’m sorry, Doctor Wolensk is operating just now.

HARDY: I just want the vet.

NURSE: Doctor Wolensk is the animal doctor.

HARDY: Oh. The animal doctor … Well, I’ll just go and talk to

him a minute. (He moves to the door.)

NURSE: I’m sorry, it is not permitted –

(LAUREL catches her by the arm, quite pleasantly.)

LAUREL: He’s an animal lover.

(HARDY goes through the door. The NURSE tries to get free of

LAUREL, who pulls her up, not quite so pleasantly.)
People he don’t like so much.

17. INT. OPERATING ROOM. SAME TIME

WOLENSK is working over an unconscious dog. He
looks up and sees HARDY.

WOLENSK: Who are you?

HARDY: I’m looking for a friend.

WOLENSK: There is no one here. Please leave.

HARDY: (Sympathetically) Oh! … A broken leg?

WOIENSK: That’s right. A car accident.

HARDY: I would shoot him.

WOLENSK: (Shocked) Shoot the dog?

HARDY: No, the driver.

WOLENSK: (Shouts) Nurse! (To 
HARDY) Who gave you

permission –?

(HARDY takes out an automatic and examines it casually.)

HARDY: No, I mean I’d really shoot him, I get so angry.

(WOLENSK pauses and looks fearfully at HARDY.)
This friend of mine has a monkey.

WOLENSK: What’s his name?

HARDY: I don’t know.

WOLENSK: You don’t know your friend’s name?

HARDY: Oh – I thought you meant the monkey.

WOLENSK: Look – what is this?

HARDY: Where do monkeys come from?

WOLENSK: Africa … South America …

no 
Austrian 
monkeys 
or 
Serbian, 
Bulgarian, 
no

Montebiancan monkeys. Naturally. It gets too cold for
them. And of course we do not have the jungle. Altogether,
a monkey needs special attention here. Injections and so
on. They would come to you; of course. You are the only
vet. The only animal doctor, that is to say. My friend had
another monkey but it died. A shooting accident. I think
probably there is another monkey now. Very very probably.
If so, no doubt you have done injections, and you can tell
me where my friend lives.

WOLENSK: Oh …

HARDY: By the way, this gun is a toy, I do not really shoot

motorists.
(HARDY puts the gun back in his pocket, rendering it
harmless at the psychological moment.

WOLENSK laughs his relief, laughs away his own foolishness
for being so frightened.)

WOLENSK: Yes … Your friend lives in the Sondra Apartments,

top floor.

HARDY: Thank you, Doctor. By the way, what is my friend’s

name?

WOLENSK: Buchner.

(The illogicality of the question catches up on him, but

HARDY has gone.)

18. INT. SONDRA APARTMENT BLOCK. DAY

It is obviously fashionable and expensive. LAUREL

and HARDY approach it and glance dubiously at each
other, but they go in.

19. INT. SONDRA APARTMENTS. DAY

The lift arrives at the top floor. LAUREL and HARDY
come out of the lift. They are in a carpeted hall.
HARDY takes out his automatic and holds it down by
his side.
LAUREL rings the doorbell of the penthouse.
The door is opened by a uniformed MAID. LAUREL and
HARDY don’t like this.

LAUREL: Mr Buchner at home?

MAID: Mrs Buchner?

LAUREL: Mr Buchner.

MAID: No Mr Buchner.

(HARDY pushes past her and goes in.)

20. INT. PENTHOUSE. SAME TIME

As though he owns the place HARDY throws open
every door he sees. Behind the third one is MRS
BUCHNER in bed, sitting up and looking very
beautiful in a negligee, eating breakfast off a tray
and offering a spoonful of soft-boiled egg to her
monkey.

21. EXT. SONDRA APARTMENT BLOCK. DAY

LAUREL and HARDY walk out of the building. HARDY
pauses on the pavement and furiously thumps his fist
against the wall, and wonders what to do next.
Down the road comes a car, a smallish saloon, say a
Fiat. It just goes past, but the occupants are featured
– ACHERSON and CAROL.

22. EXT. MONTEBIANCA. DAY

The Fiat drives out of the town.

23. EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY

The Fiat in the distance, in bare, hilly country. Its
approach is being watched by a BOY. The BOY is with
the camera on a hilltop. Down the opposite slope, in
the valley, is the village. The car is heading towards
the village.

24. INT. CAR. SAME TIME

CAROL is looking at the guidebook.
The road is a very bad one, narrow and rutted. The
car bumps all the time and has to go quite slowly.

CAROL: Nice to get off the beaten track.

(ACHERSON is silent.)
It says the views are unexampled by the largest traveller.

ACHERSON: Views of what?

CAROL: I don’t know. Do you want to stop for a while?

ACHERSON: Why?

CAROL: Why? We’re supposed to be on holiday. What’s the

matter?

ACHERSON: Nothing’s the matter. I’m not in a holiday mood.

Besides, I’m combining it with business, aren’t I? I’m
taking the little woman on a sales trip. Nice hotel, exotic
food, unexampled views, all on the firm. A perk.

CAROL: Who’d send a salesman to Montebianca?

ACHERSON: We would. It’s off the beaten track. Tell me, do you

fancy Giles Foster?

CAROL: Yes, I do rather.

ACHERSON: I thought you did.

CAROL: I thought you thought I did. (Pause.) Were you really

at school with him?

ACHERSON: Yes.

CAROL: Well, he’s doing quite well. I hope you’re not going to

spoil my holiday.

25. EXT. THE ROAD. SAME TIME

The BOY, in the same position, watches the car,
which is too far away to be audible. Then he turns
and starts making his way quickly down the opposite
slope, descending towards the village.

26. EXT. THE VILLAGE. SAME TIME

The BOY runs into the village. He goes into the bar.

27. INT. BAR. SAME TIME

The bar is almost empty. The boy’s father (BORIS) is
the barman. He is talking to the only customer. The
BOY goes past them, through a door and then up the
back stairs.

28. INT. PHILO’S ROOM. SAME TIME

PHILO is asleep on an unkempt bed in an unkempt
room. He obviously has few possessions; but one of
them is a monkey. The boy’s knock is heard. The
monkey wakes PHILO. The BOY opens the door and
comes in.

BOY: Captain! Somebody comes.

PHILO: (Waking) Hah?

BOY: A car comes. You said to wake you any time –

PHILO: Yes. Who comes?

BOY: A car. A Fiat, I think.

PHILO: So?

BOY: You told me –

PHILO: Yes. How many people?

BOY: I don’t know. I was on the hill. I ran here.

PHILO: Of course. My good scout.

BOY: Maybe only a tourist. They get lost.

PHILO: Of course. They will drive through to Zlens. Tell me if

they stop, eh? If it’s children in the car it’s all right. Tell
me if it’s just men. Anything funny, you tell me, eh?

BOY: Yes, Captain. Who do we wait for?

PHILO: I tell you, it could be a bishop and his grandmother, or

the last man in the Tour de Monte bicycle race. But
probably there is no need for play-acting. Probably he will
look like a debt collector. A debt collector can be any man
in a suit and a car. Tell me if it stops.

BOY: He wishes you to pay a debt?

PHILO: Yes.

BOY: But you do not wish to pay it?

PHILO: If it can be avoided. I do not owe it. Do you see?

BOY: Of course. Will you buy me a gun?

PHILO: What do you want a gun for? This is not cowboys. (He

picks up the monkey.) Oh no, it is not cowboys.

29. INT. HOTEL ROOM. IN THE TOWN. DAY

Laurel’s and Hardy’s room.
LAUREL lies on his back on one of the twin beds.
HARDY paces up and down.

LAUREL: Books. The library.

HARDY: For me it’s still the monkey. For ten years in Moscow

he keeps a monkey. Maybe the monkey is the only friend
he trusted, a man in his position. Now he is alone
somewhere. I see him with a monkey. We’ll try the pets’
doctor again. Show him the photo.

LAUREL: Now you show him the photo … (He laughs shortly.)

HARDY: Who would expect two people with monkeys in a place

like this?

LAUREL: Not me. A monkey is a risk for him. ‘Look at that

man, he has a monkey’ … no.

HARDY: After a while a man takes risks. Two years now. He

thinks he is well hidden. Maybe even forgotten. He needs a
friend who asks no questions. I think we visit the animal
doctor.

LAUREL: No, the animal nurse. You spoiled the doctor. Next

time if he has any more friends with monkeys he will say
nothing and then telephone.

30. EXT. VILLAGE. DAY

ACHERSON and CAROL walk into the village. They are
objects of great curiosity. It is not the kind of village

which is used to tourists. VILLAGERS, mainly children
and old people, emerge and watch them.

31. INT. PHILO’S ROOM. SAME TIME

PHILO sees this from the window. ACHERSON starts
talking to one of the VILLAGERS.
The BOY enters the room urgently.

PHILO: Yes – I see them. I don’t like this walking.

(Cutaway to ACHERSON.)

ACHERSON: It’s very simple. I want – to buy – money – look, I

have money – I want to buy petrol. Auto er no go, halt.
(Nobody 
understands 
him. 
BORIS 
shows 
up 
and

gestures ACHERSON and CAROL to enter the bar. 
Finish cutaway.)

BOY: Tourists. English.

PHILO: Yes. I suppose so.

BOY: My father is bringing them. What shall I do‚ Captain?

PHILO: Nothing. Yes – take Mimi. In your room.

(He gives the BOY the monkey, and the BOY goes out. PHILO
takes a big drink‚ pouring from a bottle into a dirty glass.
There is a knock on the door, and BORIS shows in ACHERSON
and CAROL, with a flourish.)

BORIS: Anglitch!

ACHERSON: I say, do you speak English?

PHILO: Yes.

ACHERSON: Thank the Lord for that. We’ve run out of petrol,

about a mile down the road, if you can call it a road.

PHILO: You were coming here?

ACHERSON: No. Well, we weren’t going anywhere in particular.

Just having an afternoon off … a bit of a tour … the views,
and all that.

PHILO: An afternoon off?

ACHERSON: We’re in Montebianca, for the week; business and

pleasure, sales and marketing – last year was Majorca,
frightful place, but it gets you away –

CAROL: Charles …

ACHERSON: Oh yes – getting off the point. My name’s Acherson

… My wife, Carol.

CAROL: How do you do? – We’d be awfully grateful if you …

PHILO: You ran out of petrol just from Montebianca?

ACHERSON: We hired the car there, paid for it to be topped up

– they’re all such thieves. They took me for just another
stupid tourist. Well, they won’t get away with it. I’ve got
connections at the Consulate. Look – is there any petrol in
the village?

PHILO: No, no cars, no tractors. The fields are too rocky, they

use horses.
(He speaks briefly to BORIS, who replies.) Yes, there’s a
pump four miles back where you turned off the main road.
He’ll send someone to get a can for you.

ACHERSON: Thank you. Can you tell him we’ll pay for the

trouble.

PHILO: He knows that.

(BORIS leaves the roam.)

ACHERSON: Well, we mustn’t impose on you.

CAROL: No. Is there a bathroom? – I could do with a bit of a …

PHILO: (Suddenly deciding to accept them) There’s clean

water in the jug. Please avail yourself. The towel’s clean,
too – you’re lucky; I count the weeks by clean towels.

ACHERSON: Have you been here long?

PHILO: Yes.

ACHERSON: Well, the simple life. I must say I quite envy you.

the claret wasn’t château-bottled.

are you?

PHILO: No.

ACHERSON: It’s our first time here. Always been curious to see

the place. Beautiful country, charming people –

CAROL: He can’t stand it –

ACHERSON: Now hold on, Carol …

PHILO: I can’t stand it either.

ACHERSON: Frightful hole, isn’t it? Why don’t you leave?

PHILO: I have a problem with papers.

ACHERSON: Oh yes … they’re very keen on papers. Well –

(He turns to CAROL, who is drying her hands.)

PHILO: Did you find soap?

CAROL: Yes, thank you. Where should I empty the water?

PHILO: It’s all right.

CAROL: Well, thank you.

ACHERSON: We’ll be in the bar. Might see you there. Perhaps

we could buy you a drink before the fellow comes back
with the petrol.

PHILO: Yes. Thank you. I usually have a glass or two around

this time.

ACHERSON: Fine.

(PHILO closes the door after them, and sits down on the
bed. He laughs to himself‚ at himself, and has a drink on
himself.)

32. EXT. MONTEBIANCA TOWN. SHOPS CLOSING. LATE

AFTERNOON

LAUREL and HARDY are watching the vet’s door. One
or two cars are parked around there. LAUREL, bored,
is glancing at the guidebook. He starts to laugh.

LAUREL: Hey‚ it mentions you. The views are unexampled by

the largest traveller.
(HARDY glowers at him.
Up the road, the NURSE comes out of the vet’s. She walks
away from them, and they start to move. But after three
paces she stops and gets into the front passenger seat of a
waiting car. LAUREL and HARDY look round helplessly but
this is not a taxi-laden place. The NURSE is seen to kiss the

BOYFRIEND as the car moves. HARDY throws his hat on the
ground.)

33. INT. VILLAGE BAR. LATE AFTERNOON

BORIS 
behind 
the 
bar. 
Some 
LOCALS. 
PHILO,

ACHERSON and CAROL share a table and a bottle. The
BOY enters, carrying a two-gallon can with some
difficulty. He stops when he sees the three of them
together.

PHILO: Here! – S’okay.

(It is apparent that PHILO is looser through drink. The BOY
sees now that CAROL is holding Mimi the monkey.)

They are friends. (To CAROL.) Here is my other friend – in
fact he is my scout.

CAROL: He’s a scout?

(The BOY smiles but is disappointed by PHILO. ACHERSON
gives the BOY money, which the BOY gives to BORIS. PHILO
explains this –)

PHILO: His father.

ACHERSON: Oh. Well, are you ready, Carol?

CAROL: I’ll wait for you here, darling. You’ll be back in half an

hour.

ACHERSON: Well, come for the walk.

way so you might as well pick me up.
(He’s not sure about it.)
Honestly, I’ll be perfectly all right.

ACHERSON: Fine. Well, see you both later.

CAROL: Bye-bye, darling.

(CAROL gives Mimi to PHILO and gets up to see ACHERSON to
the door. ACHERSON goes. Mimi sits on PHILO’s shoulder.

PHILO pours a drink.
There is a flash. CAROL has taken his picture. The camera
was in her shoulder bag.)

PHILO: (Sharply) What are you doing?

CAROL: What’s the matter?

(Everybody in the bar looks at CAROL.)
I like to take pictures. Is it all right?

PHILO: (Subsiding) Yes … of course.

CAROL: I’d like to take some in the village.

PHILO: Yes. Why not?

34. EXT. THE CHURCH. LATE AFTERNOON

A wedding is taking place.
A BRIDE and GROOM and wedding guests come out of
the church with much gaiety.
CAROL takes a picture.
CAROL moves around the village looking for and
finding picturesque subjects. She is watched by not
particularly friendly faces of women. CAROL see

PHILO watching her from his upstairs window. She
waves at him cheerfully. She raises the camera to her
eye, but through the lens she sees his window empty.
The shadows lengthen.

35. EXT. ROAD. SAME TIME

ACHERSON walks along the road. There is no one in
sight. Then ACHERSON gets the feeling he is being
watched. He looks around. Perhaps he hears a
sound. The surroundings begin to look sinister to
him. He hurries on towards the car. Then he
definitely sees something move, off the road, behind
rocks. He puts the can down quietly and moves off
the road and waits. After a moment he moves aside
quietly and then changes direction back towards the
road. Ahead of him, his back to ACHERSON, the BOY
reveals himself.

ACHERSON: (Relieved) Hey! – You scouting?

(The BOY looks at him, embarrassed.)
Come on, then.
(The car is only yards away. ACHERSON gets the can. The
boy takes the cap off the tank, and ACHERSON pours the
petrol. When the can is empty, ACHERSON puts it into the
car. The BOY screws the cap on the tank.
There is the sound of petrol trickling. ACHERSON sees petrol
on the road and realizes the tank is holed.
The BOY is paying no attention. On the back window-ledge
of the car, among boxes and odds and ends, he sees part of
a rifle.)

36. INT. VILLAGE BAR. LATE AFTERNOON

PHILO, without Mimi, is drinking. CAROL comes in
and puts the camera on the table in front of him.

CAROL: Hello.

PHILO: Mrs … I’ve forgotten your name.

CAROL: Acherson.

of petrol. I don’t see many people …

CAROL: You didn’t seem very pleased at first.

PHILO: I didn’t know who you were … You could have been …

anybody.

CAROL: Well we were. (She smiles at him.)

PHILO: What does your husband do?

CAROL: He’s a sales executive.

PHILO: What does that mean? A salesman?

CAROL: I suppose so. He never discusses work at home. I

suppose he’s just a salesman.

PHILO: He said he had connections. At the Consulate.

CAROL: Oh that. A school friend. Charles was just bad-

tempered about the car. He isn’t frightfully good about
Abroad. Last year the Spaniards were dirty, the year
before the French were grasping and the year before that
the Italians were impertinent. Now the Montebiancans are
all thieves – oh‚ I say, you’re not –?

PHILO: No, I’m not.

CAROL: Well, what are you?

PHILO: We’re not on the maps any more. The Russians, you

know … They saved us in the war, that’s how it started,
and now they have saved us out of existence. I’d like to go
back while my own language is still being spoken. But I
can’t leave here.

CAROL: Did you choose to come?

PHILO: Choose? I don’t know. It’s neutral ground. They let me

in and they let me stay.

CAROL: What do you do?

PHILO: Drink. I have some savings, in the bank in town. I write

Boris a cheque once a month.

CAROL: And when the money’s gone?

PHILO: When the money’s gone I’ll be dead, if I time it right.

What does your husband sell?

CAROL: Toys.

(This naturally brings PHILO up short.)

PHILO: Toys?

CAROL: Yes, that’s right. Toytown International. He’s on the

export side.
(PHILO stares at her.)

37. MIX TO REPRISE, SCENE 9

Telephone: Toytown International.

PHILO: Toytown? Thank you. I want the Sales Director in

charge of train sets.
(SANDERS cuts off the call.)

SANDERS: I’m out.

(OTIS joins him in the frame.)
This is Mr Otis of Model Aeroplanes. He’s taken over
Exports.

OTIS: Welcome to Vienna, Mr Marin.

SANDERS: Mr Otis is an American. I’m afraid.

OTIS: I’m attached to London. Just happened to be visiting.

Kind of lucky.

38. EXT. VIENNA STATION. SAME TIME

PHILO, SANDERS and OTIS walk out of the station and
into a waiting car‚ all three men getting into the
back.

39. INT. CAR. SAME TIME

The car moves off through the city.

SANDERS: My name is Sanders. A friend of a friend called from

the frontier. Pity about the trouble. Who was it?

PHILO: An American salesman. Comisky, I think. Poor man.

They killed my monkey, too.

OTIS: Your monkey, Mr Marin?

PHILO: I couldn’t leave Nana behind – I’d had her for years.

OTIS: That’s an exotic sort of pet, Mr Marin. You must have

felt pretty secure.

PHILO: Why not?

OTIS: But at the frontier …

PHILO: I don’t understand it.

SANDERS: They must have known you were doing a bunk. They

were waiting for you.

PHILO: I don’t know – I’ve been thinking, perhaps it was

Comisky they wanted – perhaps he was – somebody in the
game – a bizarre coincidence …

OTIS: (Coldly) They were waiting for you. Think about it,

Marin. Just stay quiet and think about it.

PHILO: (To SANDERS) Who is this man? I want to see Brigadier

Payne in London. I work for him. And him I trust.

club, where he reads The Times through a magnifying
glass, I’m told. The old soldiers have gone, and the
professionals are in charge.

OTIS: You’ve been away a long time, Marin, and for the last

four years you’ve been working for me. And at the moment
I don’t even know if you are who you are supposed to be,
because you’re supposed to be dead, you and your monkey.
(The car stops outside an old nondescript building.)

40. EXT. CAR. SAME TIME

The three of them get out of the car and enter the
building. Outside the main door there is a brass
plate: Toytown International.

41. INT. TOYTOWN OFFICE. DAY

A simple room. Sanders’s office.
SANDERS sits behind the desk. PHILO stands. OTIS is
not there.

PHILO: You take your orders from an American?

SANDERS: I wouldn’t put it like that. It’s liaison, common

interest. There’s been a merger. None of us likes it. Otis
reports to a committee of three, one of whom is a German.
Funny old world. I can tell you that because the German’s
mistress ran off to Moscow with the Naval Attaché. But I
suppose you’d heard.

PHILO: No, I hadn’t. Brigadier Payne was kicked out?

SANDERS: Decent sort, Payne. Trouble was he bumped off a

couple of Washington’s lads in East Berlin – the Americans’
own fault, in my view, since they never told us what they
were about, but the result was this idiotic combined ops,
and I have to take orders from Otis. Though I wouldn’t put
it like that. He’s top man for the toy factory now as far as
Clearance goes. I’m told he’s decent sort when you get to

know him, but no one ever has, so his decency is a sort of
secret.

PHILO: Have you got a drink in here?

SANDERS: Heavens, no.

PHILO: Well, what happens now?

SANDERS: What did you want?

PHILO: I want to go back to England.

SANDERS: To the office?

PHILO: I don’t know.

SANDERS: Nor me. It’s not like it was with Payne.

PHILO: I had a right to leave, Sanders.

SANDERS: You were working for us.

PHILO: I’m not a British agent. I don’t belong to anybody.

(OTIS enters, carrying a file.)
I don’t owe you people a thing.

OTIS: An explanation, Philo.

PHILO: Oh – so I’m not dead?

OTIS: Your prints came through for you. (He tosses a

fingerprint card on the desk.) Well, now. What brings you
to Vienna?

PHILO: (Shrugs) You had a friend inside. One day he had

enough.

OTIS: Why?

PHILO: That would take a lot of explaining.

OTIS: Well, I’d like to take your explanation back to London,

and I’m leaving tonight.

PHILO: Without me?

OTIS: That depends. Why did you have enough?

PHILO: Look, I wasn’t in it for your country. I had my own.

OTIS: Common interest.

PHILO: That may have been so in the old days. Now my

country doesn’t even show on your maps. The tanks have
been followed by the map-makers, and in the schools the
children are only taught Russian. I wasn’t doing any good
in there. I was doing more before.

OTIS: (Angrily) What – with that sad little group of émigrés

keeping the flag flying from a maisonette in Notting Hill?
That’s where Payne took you from, Marin, and it’s a lot
sadder now with their photographs of dead generals and
their middle-aged amateurs getting picked up in Leningrad

with their coat linings stuffed with leaflets. Leaflets! Don’t
tell me you came back for that?

PHILO: No.

OTIS: What, then?

PHILO: Listen, Otis. They’ve got away with it. My war is lost. It

was probably lost before I joined it. And I’m tired of
fighting in yours.

OTIS: That’s why you got out?

PHILO: Yes.

OTIS: Just like that? Catch a train in Moscow, change here and

there, across borders, everything smooth, no questions, all
the way to the frontier. And then they shoot the wrong
man.

PHILO: That’s right.

OTIS: Most people have more trouble.

PHILO: Most people would. Listen, Otis, back in the East you

can’t do much without the right papers, but with the right
papers you can do anything. They believe in papers.
Papers are power. And my job was papers.

OTIS: And the shooting?

PHILO: I don’t know – I’ll never know.

OTIS: What do you want, Marin?

PHILO: I want a home. A country. I think you owe me that.

OTIS: I don’t owe you a thing except your gratuity, and that’s

in the bank.

PHILO: I don’t want it. I want nationality, Otis.

(OTIS regards him coolly.)

OTIS: We’ve got papers too, you know.

42. EXT. DISCOTHEQUE. NIGHT

LAUREL and HARDY have found the car. Parked.
Empty.

43. INT. DISCOTHEQUE. SAME TIME

LAUREL and HARDY find the NURSE dancing with her
boyfriend, two rockers in a room jammed with
rockers, LAUREL, with old-world courtesy, ‘cuts in’, a
custom clearly new to the BOYFRIEND, who would

resist but HARDY gathers him in a friendly embrace
with a hearty cry of recognition. The BOYFRIEND
protests, HARDY kisses him on each cheek, and lifts
him an inch off the floor and moves him like a shop-
window dummy behind a pillar and puts him down.
The BOYFRIEND hits HARDY, who starts a casual sort
of fight which quickly achieves Hardy’s intention:
two 
BOUNDERS 
converge 
on 
HARDY 
and 
the

BOYFRIEND and expel them from the premises.
HARDY plays it soft.

44. EXT. DISCOTHEQUE. SAME TIME

HARDY and the BOYFRIEND are shoved out by the
BOUNCERS. HARDY shakes himself loose and lights a
cigar, offering one to the BOYFRIEND. The BOYFRIEND
swings at HARDY, who massacres him in a few
seconds, HARDY settles against the wall to wait for
LAUREL.

45. INT. DISCOTHEQUE. SAME TIME

Everybody is dancing appropriately to the rock music
except LAUREL, who is firmly foxtrotting with the
helpless and bewildered NURSE.

NURSE: What do you want?

LAUREL: I have a message from a friend. He asked me to give

you this. (In his ‘leading hand’, the one holding her hand,
he is clutching the photo of Philo. He turns the photo
towards her.)

NURSE: What’s that?

LAUREL: You know him. Think back.

(The gamble pays off.)

NURSE: Oh yes. What do I want with a picture of Mr Kramer?

LAUREL: Kramer. Exactly. He brought his monkey to the

animal doctor and instantly he was in love.

NURSE: Monkey? What monkey? I knew him when I worked in

the library. That was a year ago.

LAUREL: The library, by all the saints. (Pause) He lived near

the library?

NURSE: In the Olympia Hotel. I was always sending him

reminders.

LAUREL: Reminders?

NURSE: For the books. Where is my friend? Will you stop

making this stupid dance, you make me ridiculous.

LAUREL: Listen, you’re dancing with a genius. (He shakes his

head scornfully.) Monkey …

46. INT. FOYER OF OLYMPIA HOTEL. NIGHT

LAUREL and HARDY arrive. It’s a small hotel, and
there is only a DESK CLERK around, LAUREL is still
smirking and laughing to himself.
HARDY looks grim. They arrive at the desk.

CLERK: Good evening.

HARDY: What room is Mr Kramer?

CLERK: Kramer? There is no Mr Kramer.

(HARDY reaches out for the CLERK’s throat, drags him over
the counter and stands him up.)

HARDY: Do not tell me there is no Mr Kramer.

LAUREL: (Amused) The one with the monkey.

CLERK: Oh – him.

(The smile drops off LAUREL’s face. HARDY turns to look at
him expressionlessly.)

HARDY: Yes. Him.

47. INT. THE BAR. EVENING

Some kind of bar game going on. Skittles perhaps.
CAROL is watching it. LOCALS playing and drinking.
She reaches for her camera to take a picture, starts
to check that she’s turned the film on, pauses,
frowns at the camera. She opens the camera. There
is no film in it now.

48. EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. EVENING

PHILO is moving rapidly towards the car, short-
cutting across rocks. From behind a rock, a rifle
pokes at him.
Close-up of trigger being squeezed.
It’s a cap-rifle. The BOY stands up gleefully. He’s got
a cowboy hat on, too. PHILO turns the other way and
sees ACHERSON.

ACHERSON: Hello, old man. Bad news.

PHILO: The car will not take you away after all.

ACHERSON: Right. Tank’s holed.

PHILO: Of course. You’re bad news for me, Acherson.

ACHERSON: How’s that, old man?

(PHILO goes up to the car and looks in. He takes out one of
the boxes lying on the back seat. The box has a picture of
a train set and some writing, PHILO looks at the box and
tosses it back.)

PHILO: So you’re in the toy business.

ACHERSON: That’s it. Santa Claus.

PHILO: You might as well go home.

ACHERSON: Old man, I don’t understand you at all. How far is

that garage?

PHILO: (Pause) It’s not a garage. It’s a pump.

ACHERSON: This is a welding job. It seems we’re here for the

night. (He moves to walk back.)

PHILO: Acherson! – you’re wasting your time! I don’t owe you

people a thing!

ACHERSON: Anything you say, old man. (He strides off.)

BOY: Is he the debt collector?

PHILO: No – not the one I feared. This one I despise.

49. INT. CONTINUATION OF FLASHBACK

Two locomotives race past each other.
If’s a toy train set, or rather several of them
combined into an extensive layout, on the floor of a
store room which contains many boxes of toys,
including boxes identical to the one seen in
Acherson’s car in the last scene.

PHILO is playing trains.
The door is audibly unlocked and opened.

PHILO: (Without turning round) I’m not hungry, take it away.

(But it’s OTIS, accompanied by SANDERS.)

OTIS: Well, you’ve managed to pass the time, I see. I’m glad

somebody plays with the window-dressing.

PHILO: Where’ve you been?

OTIS: Taking a personal interest, in London.

(OTIS gets interested in the train set and squats down to
mess with it. Pretty soon trains are whizzing round, with

OTIS working the points as he talks.)

PHILO: I could have come with you.

OTIS: On your papers?

PHILO: Next time I’ll come out with a British passport and a

working permit. Look, can’t we just go and discuss it over
a drink somewhere?

OTIS: As of now you’re free. Sorry it took so long.

PHILO: Free? Free to do what? go where?

OTIS: Home.

PHILO: London?

(OTIS looks at him.)

OTIS: Home.

PHILO: What are you talking about? You know what would

happen to me if I went back there … God, I need a drink …

OTIS: What made you hit the bottle?

PHILO: Hit the bottle?

OTIS: You made a fool of yourself at a public dinner on the

seventh; you were drunk at a reception for the Polish
delegation the week you came out, and at another for the
Bulgarians the week before that. It seems you even drank
in your office. Why was that?

PHILO: Well, I congratulate you. I also drank in bed. Did no

one tell you?

OTIS: Why?

(SANDERS has squatted down and is messing with the trains
but he gets the points switched wrong and there is a
minor derailment.) (Irritably) Sanders, what the hell do
you think you’re doing? (To PHILO) Why?

PHILO: Nerves.

OTIS: What did you have to be nervous about?

PHILO: That’s a damn silly question.

OTIS: What were you nervous about? (Pause.) You were all

right. A comrade. Good record. Impeccable behaviour.
Regular promotion. Suddenly you had nerves.

PHILO: I had decided to get out.

OTIS: Why?

PHILO: I told you.

OTIS: Speeches. Speeches about maps and schoolchildren.

Why did you get out?

PHILO: Otis, I’m not talking to you any more.

OTIS: And how did you get out? (For this he abandons the

train set and looks straight into PHILO’s eyes.) Think before
you reply. The right answer might get you where you want
to go.

PHILO: I’m telling you the truth. I told you why and I told you

how.

OTIS: You gave yourself false papers.

PHILO: Not false. The real thing, falsely obtained. That’s a

trick which perhaps only one man in the country could
have played, and only once, but I was the man.

(He spells it out now.) Only you were already blown.

PHILO: (Total disbelief) No.

OTIS: You were blown.

PHILO: I tell you I wasn’t.

OTIS: How long had they been on to you?

PHILO: If they were on to me I didn’t know it.

OTIS: You knew it because they told you.

PHILO: No! They had nothing on me! For God’s sake, I was

sending you stuff almost to the week I left.

OTIS: Fakes.

PHILO: Don’t be stupid – the stuff was from my own

department.

OTIS: They were fakes, Marin. The Reschev Memorandum was

a fake, and so was the Geller business. Blinds, both of
them, and that takes us back four months.

PHILO: You’re wrong –

OTIS: I’m not wrong, because Geller’s dead. What do you

think I was doing in Vienna when you showed up?

PHILO: (Shaken) I didn’t know. I swear I didn’t know. If they

were using me I didn’t know it.

OTIS: Then how did you get out?

(PHILO now understands the implication.)

PHILO: You think I made a deal with them?

operation …

PHILO: You’re mad. And they’re not stupid. If I had made a

deal they’d expect you to think of it.

OTIS: So they shot that poor bastard Comisky.

(PHILO is shaken by that.)

PHILO: Oh … Otis, if you think that, there’s no talking to you.

OTIS: I don’t like that shooting. It makes you look too clean

for words, it’s like a diploma. I don’t like it at all. Those
babies don’t shoot the wrong man, and they don’t shoot
anybody on a frontier railroad track like it was their
nomination for an Oscar. If they wanted you they could
have taken you any time you stepped outside your front
door. Why didn’t they?

PHILO: If you want to know what I think, I think now that they

were on to me, they found out I’d gone; but they didn’t
know where I was till I showed my papers on that last
train, and then there was no time to do things properly,
just a quick bullet at the frontier for the man with the
monkey.

OTIS: You’d never have got so far.

PHILO: I was careful, and I had the right papers.

OTIS: You would have been followed for weeks, everywhere.

They would have known everything you were doing.

PHILO: How do you know? Maybe I had a tail, maybe not,

Maybe I lost him or he lost me. Maybe I was luckier than I
knew. I don’t know, and you don’t know.

OTIS: I didn’t know. But there’s a doubt, and that’s enough.

The British don’t want you. Do you, Sanders?
(SANDERS says nothing.)

PHILO: Now wait a minute – I’m not asking you for a job. But a

home is one thing you owe me. (He turns to SANDERS.) I
was your man, I played your game for fifteen years, and
now I want to come home.

SANDERS: I’m sorry … You’re a bad risk, that’s all. I really am

sorry, Marin … you know what they’re like.

OTIS: They didn’t like the Reschev thing going wrong. It cost

a lot of money. And they didn’t like Geller being dead. I
don’t like it either. In fact if I had my way, I wouldn’t let
you walk away quite so fast and easy.
(OTIS turns to leave the room. On his turn, PHILO moves
forward in anger to grab him, but SANDERS restrains PHILO;
which saves PHILO’s life, because OTIS has turned back with
a gun in his hand. This tableau slowly relaxes.)

PHILO: Yes … you really believe it, don’t you? You think I came

over to work from your factory.

OTIS: I doubt they were hoping for the jackpot, not in the

factory but maybe somewhere on the road … I guess
they’d know I wouldn’t employ a Russian national in the
factory, however clean he was.

PHILO: (His worst moment) I’m not Russian!

(Even OTIS is taken aback by that.)

OTIS: Like you said, look at the maps. (He goes out.)

50. INT. SANDERS’S OFFICE. DAY

From 
a 
zip-bag, 
SANDERS 
is 
taking 
out 
the

possessions which had been taken from PHILO on his
arrival.
PHILO watches him from the chair, his energy gone.

SANDERS: Wallet … money … diary … lighter.

(The lighter is in pieces. SANDERS reassembles it.)

PHILO: You’re making a mistake.

SANDERS: It’s like this, Marin. There are two kinds of mistake

Otis can make. He can let a bad apple in or keep a good
apple out. If he makes the first mistake things could go
very badly for Otis. If he makes the second mistake – well,
who’s going to ever know? (Hands over the lighter.)
Lighter. (Opens a cigarette case.) How many cigarettes did
you have in here?

PHILO: I don’t know.

(SANDERS reaches into his pocket for his own case and
feeds a few of his cigarettes into Philo’s case.)

SANDERS: The Americans are so touching. They still expect to

find something inside a cigarette.

PHILO: Where am I supposed to go?

SANDERS: That’s up to you. Anywhere they’ll have you. Shop

around.

PHILO: Shop? I can’t even move. I’ve got to have papers – you

know that.

SANDERS: I could mention a couple of embassies to you. It’s

most unfortunate. There used to be quite a few places, but
nowadays it’s all one big place, underneath.
(PHILO stares out of the window.)

PHILO: They’ll be looking for me. I think you know that,

Sanders.

SANDERS: (Evenly) If they find you I’ll know it. It really isn’t

my show, you know.

looking for me himself. Perhaps next month, perhaps next
year – it could be longer; but that Reschev paper was the
real thing, and when Otis realizes that, he’s going to need
me badly. He’s going to need me to save his little war, and
his career. But you tell him not to waste his time, because
now I wouldn’t spit on him, not if he was on fire.

51. INT. PHILO’S ROOM. NIGHT

PHILO, drinking, alone, lying on the bed.
He hears sounds outside the window and goes to
look. In the yard, a horse is pulling the Fiat in, with
the BOY at the horse’s head, and ACHERSON at the
wheel. ACHERSON gets out of the car, and looks up
steadily at PHILO while PHILO stares back.

52. INT. SECOND (ACHERSONS’) ROOM. SAME TIME

CAROL also watching from the window.
This room is bare … two beds, a couple of chairs, a
washstand.

53. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT

The DESK CLERK leads LAUREL and HARDY to one of
the bedroom doors. He knocks. The door is opened

by a wild-looking middle-aged woman with a parrot
on her shoulder.

WOMAN: What is it, Joseph?

JOSEPH: There are some men, they wish to speak with you.

(LAUREL and HARDY move in politely but firmly.)

54. INT. WOMAN’S ROOM. SAME TIME

The room is a menagerie of pets of all kinds, and
consequently squalid.

WOMAN: The maid refuses to clean my room, Joseph. Will you

speak to her?

HARDY: We are friends of Mr Kramer.

CLERK: You remember Mr Kramer? With the monkey?

WOMAN: Of course. I have not seen him since he left here.

CLERK: These men were wondering if you knew … if he told

you where he was going.

WOMAN: He was my friend.

HARDY: Naturally.

WOMAN: As you see I have many friends, but he was unique,

you understand.

LAUREL: I understand. He talked to you.

WOMAN: All my friends talk to me.

LAUREL: Oh yes. (To parrot) Where’s Kramer? (He tries to

ruffle the parrot’s neck and gets nipped. He looks around.)
Which is your best friend?

WOMAN: (Indicating parrot) My oldest friend is Tamburlaine.

He is very old.

LAUREL: Yes … well … here’s a friend. (He strokes a puppy,

making friends.)

HARDY: About Mr Kramer. Is he in town?

WOMAN: No, in the country.

HARDY: In the country? Where?

WOMAN: It’s a secret.

HARDY: A secret? We’re his friends.

WOMAN: That’s what he said. He said you’ll come and say you

are his friends.
(LAUREL produces a wicked looking flick-knife and snaps
the blade out, with his other hand holding up the puppy by
the scruff of its neck. The WOMAN and the CLERK stare at

him in disbelief. LAUREL smiles.)

HARDY: I’m sorry about my friend. Now, for one dog – where is

Mr Kramer?

55. INT. ACHERSONS’ ROOM. NIGHT

ACHERSON and CAROL are lying on their backs on
separate beds, not talking, perhaps smoking. Faint
music is heard – a local band.

ACHERSON: Well, here we are.

CAROL: Here we are.

ACHERSON: Boris says that Stanislavsky the welder will be

brought from Zlens in the morning.

CAROL: How big is that hole?

(ACHERSON makes a small hole with his finger and thumb.)
Did nobody think of chewing-gum?

ACHERSON: Stanislavsky works with nothing else. It’s his

method.

CAROL: (Amiably) Oh, shut up.

ACHERSON: (Pause) Well, I think I’ll get drunk, then.

(A knock at the door.)

CAROL: Yes, why don’t you? Come in!

(PHILO enters.)

PHILO: Excuse me.

CAROL: Hello, Mr Kramer. Thank you for arranging the room.

PHILO: I’m afraid it is not very nice, but of course they are not

used to …

CAROL: Of course.

PHILO: (Pause) I’ve been thinking about … about you being

here.

CAROL: Oh yes?

PHILO: (To ACHERSON) I see you do not wish to talk to me. I am

sorry I was rude to you.

ACHERSON: Not at all. But thank you anyway for the thought.

CAROL: What were you thinking about?

PHILO: About coincidence. I think this is the first time any

tourist has spent the night in this village, in this house.
Why you? – why now?

CAROL: Funnily enough, my mind was going on the same lines.

In fact I was wondering whether Charles had arranged the

whole thing.
(ACHERSON looks at her in sharp surprise. PHILO is also
taken aback.)

PHILO: Why should you think that?

CAROL: We were supposed to be having dinner with some

people tonight. He doesn’t like them.

ACHERSON: (Relapsing) Oh, don’t be ridiculous.

CAROL: The Fosters will think we’ve stood them up. They’ll be

disappointed.

ACHERSON: Giles Foster will be very disappointed.

CAROL: And I’m disappointed –

(ACHERSON gets suddenly to his feet.)

that music?

PHILO: The wedding feast. The whole village is there.

ACHERSON: Can we go?

PHILO: You will be welcomed. There is a tradition of

hospitality here.

ACHERSON: Good. (To CAROL) Coming?

CAROL: No, thanks.

(ACHERSON hesitates and then leaves with PHILO.)

56. INT. OUTSIDE ACHERSONS’ ROOM. SAME TIME

As they go …

PHILO: The Fosters?

ACHERSON: Friends of ours in Monte.

PHILO: The British Consul?

ACHERSON: Yes. I was at school with him. Always was a little

toady. Do you know him?

PHILO: No. Is that why you came here?

ACHERSON: No – I told you. A sales trip.

PHILO: Oh yes. Another coincidence. Where did you go last

year?

ACHERSON: Majorca. I think I mentioned that too.

PHILO: And before that?

ACHERSON: Italy. No – that was the year before. Paris last year.

Wonderful town but the French are awful, the waiters and
so on, they’re tip mad. No place like home, is there?

PHILO: When do you go back?

ACHERSON: Tomorrow night. Last train to Trieste then the

sleeper to Paris, and the boat train from there … Ever
been to England?

PHILO: Yes. Years ago.

ACHERSON: Well, if you ever think of going back I hope you’ll

look us up. We’re in the book. Acherson. Will you
remember?

PHILO: I’ll remember Toytown International.

ACHERSON: I doubt that you’ll find me there, between you and

me. Carol doesn’t know it yet but I’m sort of due for the
push.

PHILO: Oh. I’m sorry. Why?

ACHERSON: Long story. I’m not really their type.

57. INT/EXT. WEDDING FEAST. NIGHT

Whatever this involves, it involves music, dancing
and drinking not to say drunkenness.
Judging by Acherson’s state, a good lot of drinking
time has elapsed, PHILO, also drunker but joylessly,
finds ACHERSON, among new friends. They are able
to speak English, ACHERSON and PHILO, without
being understood by those around them.

ACHERSON: Frightfully good party, old man. I wish Carol would

come down.

PHILO: Yes – she could take pictures.

ACHERSON: (Hush-hush) Natives don’t like it – ruined her last

film, she says. I say, you don’t happen to have a ladies’
nightie and some perfumed soap …?

PHILO: I’m afraid not.

ACHERSON: She wanted to get away from the tourists. Now

she wants perfumed soap. Never mind, let’s have a drink.

PHILO: I like your wife very much. You don’t mind me saying

that?

ACHERSON: Not at all, old man.

PHILO: How long have you been married?

ACHERSON: Four years. It’s the only life, you know. Splendid

girl, Carol. Didn’t want to marry me at first.

PHILO: No?

ACHERSON: No, stuck on a tennis champion. Thick as two

planks.

PHILO: Do you play tennis?

ACHERSON: Golf. Handicap of eighty-one. Play much golf?

PHILO: Not much.

ACHERSON: You should. If you played golf you’d know people.

(Pauses.) Still, I don’t suppose there’s a lot of golf around
here.

PHILO: Not a lot.

ACHERSON: (Nodding wisely) They haven’t got the grass.

PHILO: What else do you do?

ACHERSON: How do you mean –?

PHILO: I want to know about your life.

ACHERSON: Oh, it’s a good life, on the whole – lots of friends,

bridge friends, golf friends … I don’t know … I mow the
lawn and help with the dishes. Quiet life, really, I don’t ask
for more. Of course, England is the place, isn’t it? I mean,
if you’re English. God, I must sound – sorry, sorry, old man,
where was I? – No, the thing about England is the trees.
Don’t you agree?

PHILO: The trees?

ACHERSON: You don’t get nice trees in other places, not the

variety. Nice trees are taken for granted in England. Yes,
awfully fond of trees, damned fond, I don’t mind telling
you. I say, I’m not drunk, you know, not entirely. Carol’s
got a tree, you know – her own. I actually bought her a
tree for her birthday. You can do that – phone them up and
tell them to send round a tree, and round it comes, on a
lorry, not a sapling, a tree. They dig a hole and in it goes,
bingo. Cherry tree. No cherries, it’s the blossom she likes.
I’d do almost anything for Carol. (He wipes away a tear.)

PHILO: Yes. I hope you will be happy, and find a job where you

– where you are their type. It’s not good, is it, if you’re not
really interested in the things.

ACHERSON: What things?

PHILO: Well, the toys, of course.

ACHERSON: Oh ah. The toys. (He starts to giggle.)

PHILO: What’s the matter?

ACHERSON: Oh, the whole thing’s so frightful, old man. I’m

glad I’m going really.

PHILO: Why are they throwing you out?

ACHERSON: I stopped a few black marks, that’s all. That’s what

the factory is all about. The actual job is merely the
surface activity. Underneath that runs the main current of
preoccupation, which is keeping one’s nose clean at all
times. This means that when things go wrong you have to
pass the blame along the line, like pass-the-parcel, till the
music stops – and you don’t know the half of it.

PHILO: No?

ACHERSON: No. I have the title of Co-ordinator. The lowest

rank of technical responsibility. Do you see the hideous
subtlety of that position? All the black marks at the bottom
rise like damp till they reach me. And those that start at
the top are deflected down. I am a sort of elephants’
graveyard for every black mark somewhere in motion in
the Department. (He looks earnestly at PHILO, caution
apparently gone.) They’re making a scapegoat out of me,
old man. Acherson pays so that honour is satisfied, and the
big chief can carry on. Well, he’s probably right. And
furthermore I don’t care, because it was making me sick –
the callous abstraction of human lives: the pin moved
across the map, the card removed from the index … it’s a
trick, old man, a sleight of mind which allows the
occasional squalid alliance for the necessary end, the
exceptional act of injustice for the overall good, the
regrettable sacrifice for the majority’s health – yes, he’s
probably right and he’s certainly got the cleanest nose in
Christendom, but if there’s a God above it will all catch up
on him one day and perhaps even he will see himself as
the cold-blooded zombie he really is, and I wish to God I
could be there.
(It is evident that, in his cups, ACHERSON has gone beyond
the physical presence of PHILO; but seeing PHILO staring at
him, ACHERSON registers the shock of self-awareness – and
tries to smile, but PHILO can’t resist it now – he comes
clean.)

PHILO: Otis …

(ACHERSON’s brain takes this. He tries to say something but
his instinct is to get away from his own indiscretion. He
staggers away, starts to run, with PHILO going after him,

leaving the party music, etc.)

58. EXT. VILLAGE. NIGHT/DAWN. SAME TIME

The street is deserted. ACHERSON stumbles and runs
into an open space, where there is a fountain pool or
a horse trough; at which point PHILO catches up with
him, grabs him and pushes him under the water.
ACHERSON comes up fighting and spluttering, and
goes down again under the water, PHILO drags him
up and shakes him, and lets him go. The whole
experience – and the water – have done something to
sober both of them.

PHILO: Now you tell me why you are in Montebianca.

ACHERSON: Who are you?

PHILO: Marin.

ACHERSON: Marin?

PHILO: Philo.

ACHERSON: Philo Marin?

PHILO: No. My code name was Philo.

ACHERSON: Code name? I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re

talking about.

PHILO: Well, I’m not talking about toy trains.

(After a pause ACHERSON gives up.)

ACHERSON: You see how I’m not their type.

PHILO: You remember Philo?

ACHERSON: Yes … I remember when you came out. There was

a fuss, wasn’t there? – at the frontier … Small world.

PHILO: Is it? What’s this so-called sales trip you’ve told your

wife about?

ACHERSON: It’s just a security leak at the Consulate. They

think the place has sprung a leak.

PHILO: A coincidence, you mean?

ACHERSON: That’s right … What the hell would I want with

you? (He picks himself up, his clothes dripping.)

PHILO: What do they say about me? Or am I forgotten?

ACHERSON: No, you’re remembered.

PHILO: What is remembered? What do they say? That I was a

traitor?

were one of them, weren’t you? Doesn’t that make you a
patriot?

PHILO: Acherson, you’re a pig.

it. It was a long time ago – and I’m getting pneumonia.

PHILO: No – I want you to know what happened.

ACHERSON: You were blown, weren’t you?

PHILO: I don’t know if I was or not. But Otis thought they’d let

me out on a long string.

ACHERSON: Otis would.

PHILO: Yes, of course he would, he’d be in the wrong job if he

didn’t – but you’re as bad as Otis, Acherson – worse
because you’re not even honest. You get a little drunk and
you start moralizing and you think because you have seen
through the dirt, that makes you clean. But you didn’t have
the morality to get out before you were kicked out, and to
tell Otis why.

ACHERSON: Point taken. Now if you’d excuse me …

PHILO: I’m sorry Acherson, but I won’t excuse you. You talk

about Otis making lives into abstract bits of his game – but
I stand in front of you and my life means nothing. Otis
knows what he did to me, but you don’t know, Acherson.
You think I’m lucky not to be in a British gaol or a Russian
cemetery, so on the whole I’m OK.

ACHERSON: No … that’s not …

PHILO: You don’t know what it is to be an outlaw. There are

only two sides in Europe now and I’m tainted to both. Well,
I found a place, and here I rot – in this no man’s land
among people who don’t speak my language, where the
landscape, the smells, the architecture, the very air, is
foreign to me. You come here for a few days and you think
it’s charming till you have to spend one night too close to
it, and then you’ll go back home and tell your golf friends
about your little adventure. Well, tell them about me.
Acherson. Tell them what they did to me.
(PHILO has followed ACHERSON towards the bar, which is
dark and empty. ACHERSON turns before going in.)

ACHERSON: Look, I’ll talk to Otis –

PHILO: Don’t waste your time.

ACHERSON: No, no, I’ll tell him …

PHILO: You don’t understand, Acherson. He had his chance.

I’d rather die in this prison.

59. INT. ACHERSONS’ ROOM. SAME TIME

Dawn, CAROL is asleep. ACHERSON comes in quietly.
He starts to strip off his wet clothes, and to dry
himself. CAROL wakes.

CAROL: Charles …!

ACHERSON: It’s all right. Go back to sleep.

CAROL: What happened to you?

ACHERSON: Our friend pushed me in the fountain.

(CAROL lies back and chuckles.)

CAROL: Good party?

ACHERSON: What do you think of him?

CAROL: He doesn’t know whether to be friendly or suspicious.

What did he have to say?

ACHERSON: Quite a bit. People like that … what does one do

about them?
(The note in his voice brings her up.)

CAROL: He upset you.

ACHERSON: He did a bit.

CAROL: You’re sorry for him?

ACHERSON: I suppose so.

CAROL: You can’t afford to be sorry for people. Not if there’s

nothing you can do about it.

ACHERSON: He’d like to leave. I offered to put in a word for

him at home, but he didn’t go for that.

CAROL: Oh … perhaps he’ll change his mind.

ACHERSON: He doesn’t like us.

CAROL: He likes me. Let’s not talk about him. (She comes over

to his bed, wearing only underwear, and kisses him
tamely.) It’s better than the hotel now.

ACHERSON: Is it?

CAROL: More sordid. (She kisses him again.) Much better.

(He starts to respond.)

60. EXT. THE ROAD. EARLY MORNING

Along the unmade road, out of sight of the village a
handful of children are walking, fooling around as
they go. They are dressed for school and carry books.
The BOY is among them.
Their road is approaching a more important metalled
road. There are still no houses in view.
The group reaches the junction. A car is heard
approaching.
The car arrives, slows down.
HARDY is driving, LAUREL is looking at a map. They
are going to turn into the village road but they are
not certain about it. The car stops some way from the
children.

The BOY looks at the car, at LAUREL and HARDY,

and he feels that these are the ‘debt collectors’. He
goes up to the car.

LAUREL: Ah … Ask him.

HARDY: (To BOY) Vlastok? (He points.)

(The BOY shakes his head. He points down the main road,
and signifies a turn further along.)

BOY: Vlastok – that way – the next road.

(LAUREL squints at his map, but HARDY is already reversing
the car. They drive off in the direction indicated by the

BOY.
A tattered old bus that serves as a school bus arrives. The
other  children climb aboard, but the BOY breaks away and
starts to trot back towards the village.)

61. EXT. BAR. THE YARD. MORNING

STANISLAVSKY the welder is busy welding under the
Fiat. ACHERSON stands by.

62. INT. ACHERSONS’ ROOM. SAME TIME

The door is open, CAROL, dressed, is repairing her
face and hair.
PHILO comes to the door.

CAROL: Hello. Charles has just gone down.

PHILO: Is the car all right?

CAROL: Pretty well. He’s just checking it. You look a bit rough.

PHILO: Yes. I’m sorry I kept your husband up so late … I think

he’s a good man.

CAROL: Well, why shouldn’t he be a good man?

(CAROL takes some Alka Seltzer out of her handbag.)
Here’s something for you. Charles had some.
(There is water in a jug, and a glass.)
I suppose the water’s all right?

PHILO: Oh yes – much better than you drink in London.

CAROL: Sorry. (She gives him the drink.)

PHILO: Thank you.

CAROL: Who looks after you?

PHILO: I don’t need much looking after. I eat downstairs on

credit. I’ve got a bank account in town.

CAROL: Do you go?

PHILO: No. It’s a three-mile walk to the bus. Boris usually goes

in for me, if I need anything.

CAROL: You’re a bit of a mystery, aren’t you?

There must be many. Do you mind if I ask you a pointless
question?

CAROL: No, go ahead. I don’t promise to answer.

PHILO: What kind of trees do you have in your garden at

home?

CAROL: Trees?

PHILO: Yes.

CAROL: (Amused) Well, let’s see – there are only three I think,

a couple of elms or something like that, and a cherry.

PHILO: Thank you.

CAROL: Is that all?

PHILO: Yes. Do you like cherries?

CAROL: Yes, but there’s no fruit on it, just flowers.

PHILO: Ah. Does your husband look after the garden?

CAROL: What, him? Golf most weekends.

PHILO: Do you play?

CAROL: No.

PHILO: What do you play?

CAROL: Nothing.

PHILO: You never did?

CAROL: I played some tennis – look, what is this?

PHILO: I’m sorry. Mrs Acherson, I’m very glad you came this

way. You are an innocent person.

CAROL: That sounds rather dull.

PHILO: Oh no, innocence is rare.

CAROL: Mr Kramer … are you in some kind of trouble?

PHILO: (Pause) I’d like to ask your husband a favour.

CAROL: Oh. You won’t get him into trouble, will you?

PHILO: No.

CAROL: All right. I’ll be down in a couple of minutes.

63. EXT. THE YARD. MORNING

ACHERSON is coming out from under the car. BORIS
finishes pouring in petrol from a can. He screws on
the cap. STANISLAVSKY has a tiny Citroën, battered.
He packs his tools.
PHILO helps ACHERSON to his feet.

PHILO: Is it all right?

ACHERSON: Yes.

PHILO: Leaving now?

ACHERSON: In a few minutes.

PHILO: About last night.

ACHERSON: I behaved stupidly.

PHILO: Yes. But you’re all right. (Pause.) You said you might

help me.

ACHERSON: If I can.

PHILO: You can. I’d like to come with you. Give me a few

minutes – I haven’t got much I want to take.

ACHERSON: Hold on, old man – go where?

PHILO: I want to come with you, when you leave the country.

ACHERSON: What do you mean?

PHILO: I want to travel with you. Party of three. Tourists.

Friends.

ACHERSON: To England?

PHILO: No, only as far as Trieste.

ACHERSON: (Bewildered) You want to go to Trieste?

PHILO: I want to go home. I can make my own way from

Trieste.

ACHERSON: I don’t understand – what do you want?

PHILO: (Climbing) Papers, Acherson. I’m asking you for

papers. And for your company over the border. Three
English tourists. They aren’t going to pick me out.

ACHERSON: (Up) What the hell are you talking about?

PHILO: Papers, Acherson! British papers! I’ve earned them.

I’m owed them. Now I’m asking you to give them to me.

ACHERSON: How on earth do you expect me to –

PHILO: Don’t lie to me, Acherson. Refuse if you’re afraid of

Otis, but don’t lie to me. I know you’ve got the rank, and I
know Foster has got the blank documents. Every season
some British tourist loses his passport, and I know what
papers Foster has got. They just need his stamp. (Pause.)
Look, I can’t leave the country in my own identity because
the West doesn’t want me, I tried before. And I can’t go
East because the Russians do want me. But as a British
subject I can get into Trieste, and from Trieste I can
disappear. I’ve still got friends, and I want to go home.

ACHERSON: You don’t know what you’re asking.

PHILO: Yes, I do. I’m asking you to deny the Otises. I’m a used-

up spy without a country, and I’m asking you to recognize
me.

ACHERSON: Look, I can probably fix a British visa, given time,

but that’s for England, Marin. You can’t use it like a free
pass to the world.

PHILO: I don’t want to go to England. I’m dying, Acherson, I’m

slowly killing myself, bottle by bottle. Well, it doesn’t
matter very much, but I don’t want to die here, I want to
die where I was born. I might last years, or only weeks, or
I could get caught on my first day, but I want that day,
Acherson.
(CAROL comes prettily towards the car.)

CAROL: Have you paid?

ACHERSON: Yes.

CAROL: Well, I suppose we should … (To PHILO) Thank you for

everything.

ACHERSON: (Like a sudden decision) Mr Kramer is coming

with us.

CAROL: Oh – fine. Into town?

PHILO: I hope to travel with you when you leave.

CAROL: Oh really? A holiday in England?

PHILO: Just as far as Trieste. Your friend Mr Foster is going to

help with the papers. That was the favour.

CAROL: I’m sure Giles will do all he can to help. If he won’t do

it for Charles, he’ll do it for me. (She glances at ACHERSON.)
He thinks I fancy him, but I don’t. (She gives ACHERSON a
brief kiss.)

ACHERSON: All right, let’s get a move on.

64. EXT. THE ROAD. DAY

Long shot.
The Fiat is going back along the road.
The BOY is short-cutting to the village, over the hill.
He sees the car in the distance, and pauses to watch
it, then continues to hurry.

65. INT. FIAT. DAY

ACHERSON driving, CAROL in front, PHILO at the back
amid luggage and boxes of toys – guns, cars, etc.
PHILO holds the monkey.

PHILO: Will you do something for me?

ACHERSON: What’s that?

PHILO: We go through Pilz – the next village on the main road.

Can you stop at the school there. I want to say goodbye to
the boy. It won’t take a minute.

ACHERSON: Yes, all right.

(Another car is coming towards them – the LAUREL and

HARDY car, say a Mercedes. The road is narrow and the
Mercedes is travelling fast. An accident is avoided.)
Who’s that?

PHILO: (Worried) I don’t know.

66. EXT. VILLAGE. SAME TIME

The BOY runs into the village, worried and scared.
The Mercedes is already there, parked, empty.
The BOY runs straight into the bar.

67. INT. PHILO’S ROOM. SAME TIME

LAUREL and HARDY are quietly looking at the room.
They realize that the bird has flown.
The BOY is heard running. He arrives in the room.
The BOY stops dead, LAUREL and HARDY recognize
him. HARDY sighs and looks at LAUREL.
The BOY backs away, but LAUREL closes the door. The
BOY is really frightened and starts to cry. HARDY
opens the door with a sudden movement and goes.
LAUREL follows him.

68. EXT. VILLAGE. SAME TIME

The Mercedes drives away at speed.

69. EXT. THE METALLED ROAD. DAY

The Mercedes at speed.

70. EXT. THE METALLED ROAD. DAY

The Fiat is being driven sedately.

71. EXT. THE METALLED ROAD. DAY

The Mercedes at speed drives through Pilz and out of
frame, leaving the Fiat in frame parked by the
school.
PHILO comes out of the school looking disappointed
and puzzled.

72. EXT. MONTEBIANCA TOWN. DAY

The Fiat drives into town.

73. EXT. MONTEBIANCA HOTEL. SAME TIME

The Fiat stops to drop CAROL and PHILO. They go into

the hotel. The Fiat moves on.

74. EXT. BRITISH CONSULATE. SAME TIME

The Fiat stops round the corner. ACHERSON gets out
and walks into the Consulate.

75. INT. CONSULATE. SAME TIME

ACHERSON climbs the rather fine staircase.

76. INT. CONSULATE OFFICE. SAME TIME

GILES FOSTER in one chair.
ACHERSON enters.
OTIS is standing by the window.

OTIS: Hello, Charles … How did it go?

(ACHERSON sits tiredly in a chair.)

ACHERSON: He’s at the hotel. I think we’ve got him all right.

But I don’t think he’ll play when he finds out. God, what a
pantomime, eh, Giles?

77. INT. HOTEL BATHROOM. DAY

PHILO enjoying a bath. The monkey is there.

78. INT. HOTEL BATHROOM. DAY

PHILO shaving, taking off much of his beard.

79. INT. BARBERSHOP. DAY

PHILO getting a haircut.
CAROL waits for him.
The Mercedes cruises by slowly. LAUREL and HARDY
looking for the Fiat.

80. EXT. CLOTHES SHOP. DAY

PHILO in new clothes, emerging with CAROL.

81. INT. PHOTOGRAPHER’S. DAY

Flash! PHILO has his picture taken.

82. INT. CONSULATE OFFICE. DAY

Close-up of Philo’s new photo on document. The
document is held by OTIS. ACHERSON is the other
person in the room.

OTIS: There you are, Charles. With this he’ll be almost as

British as you are. And that’s awfully British … old man.
(ACHERSON, it is at once clear, is in no mood for jokes,
especially jokes about Philo.)

ACHERSON: He really does want to go his own way, you know.

OTIS: That’s all right. Just get him on that train.

ACHERSON: What happens when he gets to Trieste?

OTIS: Charles, just get him on the train. The rest is taken care

of.

ACHERSON: Have you got a legal hold on him?

OTIS: (Smiles) Well, he’ll have British papers, won’t he?

ACHERSON: All this to get one old man through one gate. Why

are you here? Why do you want him so badly?

OTIS: You were briefed. You were told enough to operate on.

What the hell did you expect?

ACHERSON: I expected to be told the truth. He’s not working. I

know he isn’t. He’s got nothing. He’s drunk a lot of the
time and he sees nobody. And what on earth could anyone
pick up in this place?

OTIS: Look, you’ve done your job. So far he trusts you. So just

finish it.

ACHERSON: (Heedless) But he was clean when he came out …

You know that now, don’t you?
(If’s an accusation, OTIS hesitates, but nods, and tells the
truth.)

OTIS: Yes. And he’s not working. All right, I dropped him and

now we need him. I made a mistake.

ACHERSON: (Laughs shortly) Black mark … So here you are,

taking an interest.

OTIS: Are you trying to tell me I’m here to save my own skin?

ACHERSON: Are you trying to tell me you aren’t?

OTIS: (Sharply) Don’t push it, Charles. They might junk me yet

but they’d still need Marin. And badly. We’ve got a new
pipeline on Reschev. It looked all wrong but now it could
make a lot of important sense and we need Marin to read
it. That’s why I’m here, so get off your white horse. It
never bothered you much while you sat behind your desk
in London – you’ve got people like Marin walking
tightropes all over Eastern Europe and some of them fall
off; it never bothered you, and now suddenly it’s all
become a nice old drunk dreaming of the old country. Well,
forget it. (Pause.) (Forgiving) Look, you and I – we’ve
worked pretty well together. I thought we understood each
other.

ACHERSON: I’m beginning to understand you, Otis. Do you

know I surprised myself a little, talking to Marin. When I
got to the bit about you, what a bastard you were and all
that, I surprised myself. I found I was quite articulate on
the subject.

OTIS: Feel free. Just deliver.

ACHERSON: Oh yes, I’ll deliver. But it won’t do you any good.

He hates you and he hates us.

OTIS: Yes, he’s full of poison. It’s had time to build up, and I’ll

need time to release it. He wants a change of scene,
someone to talk to. He’ll come round, I know him. Just get
him on the train.

ACHERSON: No. He doesn’t want to go to England.

OTIS: He thinks he doesn’t, but it’s just his hurt feelings.

England was what he was holding out for.

ACHERSON: It’s gone sour on him. You turned it sour. Look,

he’s not a professional, and you’re playing by professional
rules. He’s a sick old man who probably shortened his life
by the number of years he’s worked for us and then got
kicked out for his pains. You can’t make it good now.

OTIS: (Losing patience) I’m not here to make things good. And

not  are you. What the hell do you think I’m running – a
compensations board? He was the victim of an accident
and he wasn’t insured, and it was a pity for him, and you
don’t like it. Well, I don’t like it. But he can’t go home now

because the first time he gets drunk, or the third, or the
fortieth, he’s going to confide in someone again; and if
they find out what it is we’ve got, then what we’ve got is
no good any more. Do you understand that?

ACHERSON: Yes. Yes, I suppose I do.

OTIS: Good. Well, that’s why we spent two months looking for

him before we got lucky. The Russians have been looking
for him for two years. Let’s see if we can keep ahead for
one more day.

83. EXT. STREET. DAY

The Fiat is where ACHERSON parked it.
LAUREL and HARDY have found it.
LAUREL stands on the pavement, keeping a watch.
HARDY is half in the car.

84. INT. CAR. SAME TIME

HARDY is rummaging around, puzzled at finding
boxes of toys. He tosses cars, six-shooters and dolls
aside; shakes his head. Must be the wrong Fiat. He
opens the glove locker, looks behind the sun-visors,
in the door pockets. He gets out of the car.

85. EXT. STREET. SAME TIME

HARDY Walks to LAUREL.

HARDY: I don’t know. Toys.

LAUREL: We’re wasting time.

HARDY: No … It smells right. We’ll see.

86. EXT. STREET. DAY

The Fiat twits. LAUREL and HARDY sit in the front
seats.

87. INT. CAR. SAME TIME

LAUREL looks straight ahead-cross-cut Laurel’s point-
of-view.
HARDY watches the mirror-cross-cut Hardy’s point-of-
view. A few people approach and pass from each
direction. 
LAUREL and 
HARDY are looking for

someone, who hesitates on seeing them.
HARDY sees ACHERSON in the mirror. ACHERSON
hesitates, and walks on.

HARDY: Here he is.

(ACHERSON walks past the Fiat, disowning it.

LAUREL and HARDY glance at each other and watch as

ACHERSON walks on ahead.

HARDY starts the car.
Insert ACHERSON’s tense face.)

88. EXT. STREET. SAME TIME

The Fiat moves forward slowly. When it is a few
yards behind ACHERSON, LAUREL gets out of the Fiat
while it is still moving at walking pace. The Fiat
overtakes ACHERSON, stops. HARDY gets out, turns to
ACHERSON and moves to meet him.
ACHERSON looks over his shoulder to see LAUREL
walking towards him. They move up to ACHERSON,
and without comment, ignoring Acherson’s protest,
frisk him, taking out his wallet and an envelope first.

ACHERSON: What the devil –? Who are you?

(There is nothing in Acherson’s pockets to enlighten

LAUREL and HARDY. HARDY goes through Acherson’s wallet.)
I don’t want any trouble. There’s money in there – take it.
(HARDY drops the money and bits of paper on the ground.
He hesitates. LAUREL is disgusted.)

LAUREL: Toy salesman …

ACHERSON: That’s right.

(HARDY rips open the envelope. It contains Philo’s
documents, with the photo.)

89. EXT. TOWN/COUNTRY. DAY

HARDY drives the Fiat. ACHERSON sits next to him.
Behind 
ACHERSON is 
LAUREL 
with 
a 
gun 
to

ACHERSON’s neck.

90. EXT. COUNTRY DAY

The Fiat draws up off the road at a lonely spot.
HARDY gets out and looks around. He nods at
LAUREL.
LAUREL gets out from the back, opens Acherson’s
door and stands a few paces back. LAUREL beckons.
He holds his gun down, relaxed. ACHERSON, without
hurrying, picks up a shiny Lone Ranger six-shooter
from the floor between the seats. He levels it at
LAUREL, cocks the hammer. LAUREL blinks in surprise
and starts to laugh. He brings his gun hand up, but
ACHERSON fires and the bullet knocks LAUREL over
backwards.
HARDY starts getting his own gun out but ACHERSON
kills him with his second shot.

91. INT. RAILWAY STATION. EVENING

This is the station where we saw LAUREL and HARDY
arrive. A PORTER trundles the Achersons’ luggage.
CAROL is there. She tips the PORTER. The PORTER
puts the luggage on the platform. The train is
arriving.

92. EXT. STATION BAR. SAME TIME

ACHERSON and PHILO at a table with drinks. The
monkey is in Philo’s pocket. ACHERSON takes the
(ripped) envelope out of his  pocket and gives it to
PHILO.

OTIS: Marin … are you listening to me?

PHILO: What?

ACHERSON: Change your mind. Come all the way.

(PHILO looks up from examining the papers.)

PHILO: Why? Why does it matter to you?

ACHERSON: They’ll find you and kill you.

England. I’d rather go home.

ACHERSON: England was your home once.

PHILO: I thought so too but I was wrong.

ACHERSON: (Almost angry) Marin – will you listen –

PHILO: What’s the matter? – You haven’t changed your mind?

ACHERSON: No …

PHILO: You don’t have to worry about me. Everything’s going

to be all right.

ACHERSON: That’s bloody nonsense! – you’re as good as dead

if you don’t come with me. Please stop thinking about
going home – will you, Marin?

things … I think differently. My memories are good ones
now. I don’t think about the commissars, the fear, the
system, all the things that changed when the Russians
came. The things I remember don’t change. I was born in a
small town. I lived in a street which led into a small square
and twice a week there was a market in the square. And
round about six o’clock in the evening, when the market
was packing up, the ground would be littered with
vegetables which hadn’t sold and were too cheap to save –
cabbage leaves, carrots, some peppers. I particularly
remember the peppers lying around the edges of the
square – red, orange, yellow, green, and all shades in
between, all sunset and forest colours, lying about the
square. What mattered to us then was that they were
edible, and free, but what I remember now is the way the
square looked on a summer evening after the market.
(Pause.) That’s what you are giving back to me. (The train
is heard arriving in the station. The few people in the bar
get up to leave, PHILO stands up.

ACHERSON sits tense and anguished.

CAROL comes into the bar.

CAROL: Come on, we must get on the train. The porter’s taken

the luggage.

(She turns to leave again and PHILO follows her. The door
closes behind them. ACHERSON stands up and with a sudden
decision moves briskly out, on to the platform, where PHILO
and CAROL are moving away from him.)

93. THE PLATFORM. SAME TIME

ACHERSON: (Shouts) Marin!

(PHILO and CAROL turn to him.)
You’re not going home!

PHILO: What?

ACHERSON: Forget all that! Otis is on that train.

(PHILO moves towards him. CAROL stares at ACHERSON, then
turns and starts running towards the train, out of the
scene. PHILO reaches ACHERSON.)
The whole thing is his operation. I’m sorry …
(PHILO spits in his face.)
Marin – please understand –

PHILO: You Judas! I spit on you. I am ashamed of the stupid

old man I am – but on you I spit!

ACHERSON: I’m sorry.

PHILO: – because you cheat so much for such a small prize.

Well, I will not go with you to England.

ACHERSON: Yes, I know that.

PHILO: You can take away my hope but you will not take my

honour.
(PHILO is raving. ACHERSON seems stunned, but now he’s
suddenly had enough and he turns angrily on PHILO.)

ACHERSON: Honour? – what honour? You’re a stubborn, bitter

old man. I don’t blame you – it’s understandable, you have
been ill-used. Otis made a mistake and you paid for it
because in the game we’re playing his skin is worth more
than yours and there’s never enough justice to go round.
But you carry your grievance around like a badge – that’s
all your bloody honour is and you’ve got to like it.

PHILO: I trusted you after I’d forgotten how to trust.

(The steam goes out of ACHERSON.)

ACHERSON: It’s not such a significant betrayal, judged by the

scale of the world’s duplicity.
(PHILO pushes the papers back to ACHERSON.)

PHILO: I thought you were my friend.

ACHERSON: Well, as it turns out, you were right. (He pushes

the papers back again.) I should hang on to these, because
you can’t stay here. We got to you only just in time, one
move ahead of your other friends. If I were you I should
take the morning train and see how far you can get.

PHILO: You’re lying. Where are they?

ACHERSON: I had to kill them, but there’ll be others.

PHILO: (Incredulous) You? (Laughs.) You can’t stop trying,

Acherson.
(PHILO turns to go. 

OTIS enters the scene, CAROL is behind him. OTIS greets PHILO
like an old friend.)

PHILO: I am very much as you last saw me. Please do not

waste time in persuasion. Use force or let me go.

OTIS: Marin, I need you.

PHILO: I am the same man, the same risk.

OTIS: Marin …

PHILO: No. You had no time for me then and you will not make

use of me now.

OTIS: You need me.

PHILO: No. You cheated me, Otis.

OTIS: (Getting angry) You’re cheating yourself. You want

freedom – I’m giving it to you. You want a country – you
can have it. You want apologies – you’ll get them. But you
won’t forgive and you won’t accept, and I knew you
wouldn’t so we had to go through this whole bloody
charade. And now you want to go home. All right – but first
ask yourself to which side you really belong.

PHILO: Not yours, Otis. Not anyone’s.

OTIS: Look, there are no neutral corners in this world, not for

you. I made a mistake and I’m sorry, but in this world, you
are with us.

PHILO: Words.

OTIS: You’d rather wait till their triggermen find you?

PHILO: Yes, I would.

(OTIS pauses, then nods with finality. He turns to ACHERSON
expressionlessly.)

OTIS: Are you coming?

ACHERSON: Yes.

OTIS: Think about it, Acherson.

ACHERSON: You can do what you like with me. I’ve just had

enough of this picnic. And at bottom I think you’re wrong.

OTIS: You had a duty.

ACHERSON: Duty! He’s been conned all down the line. The

Russians conned him out of his country, and the British
conned him into working for them, and you conned him out
of his due at the end of that, and now you’re conning him
to get what’s left and cover up your mistakes. So don’t
preach at me about duty.
(CAROL is frightened by this outburst.)

CAROL: (Coming forward) Charles –

ACHERSON: You go ahead. I’ll be coming.

CAROL: It’s stupid. It may be right but it’s stupid.

ACHERSON: Yes, that’s about it.

(The train makes sounds of getting ready to go.)

OTIS: Come on, let’s forget it.

(OTIS turns to go to the train. CAROL turns to follow him.

PHILO grabs her sleeve.)

PHILO: You’re his wife!

(She looks at him with stone eyes.)

CAROL: No. No, I’m not, actually.

(She follows OTIS. PHILO is stunned.)

PHILO: So much deception. Was it all necessary?

ACHERSON: Why not? It was Carol who got through your

distrust, wasn’t it? (He moves.)

PHILO: Are you really going back?

ACHERSON: Yes.

PHILO: What will they do to you?

ACHERSON: I don’t know.

PHILO: Are you frightened?

ACHERSON: No, I’m just tired. Goodbye, Marin.

PHILO: Do you think I’m worth it, Acherson?

ACHERSON: Yes, I think so.

PHILO: (A curse) Otis … I’ll kill him!

(ACHERSON smiles helplessly and moves. PHILO moves with
him.)
You touched me, Acherson. Yes, I am a stubborn, bitter
man, and you are stupid, but we are holding out for
something. Aren’t we? Stay.

ACHERSON: How can I? What for?

PHILO: They’ll break you for this.

ACHERSON: One of those things.

PHILO: (Bursts out) You think I’ll go with you, don’t you? – to

save your neck.

ACHERSON: No. Goodbye.

PHILO: You’re blackmailing me! (Desperate) Otis set this up,

didn’t he?

ACHERSON: No.

PHILO: Tell me he set it up!

ACHERSON: (Rounds on him) That’s what you want to think so

you can forget all about it. Well, think it.

PHILO: No – just tell me the truth.

ACHERSON: Otis didn’t set it up.

(ACHERSON starts running towards the train. PHILO stands
still for a moment.)

PHILO: (Screams) Acherson!

(PHILO runs after ACHERSON as the train starts to move.)

94. EXT. TRAIN AT SPEED. NIGHT

95. INT. TRAIN. NIGHT

ACHERSON stands in the corridor looking out at the
night. Behind him are the closed doors of the
sleeping compartment. The nearest door opens and
OTIS comes to ACHERSON’s shoulder. PHILO can be
seen sitting inside the compartment, on the bunk.
The adjacent compartment is seen, CAROL in the
doorway.
OTIS pats ACHERSON on the shoulder.

OTIS: Very nice. Very nice. (Pause) You need a holiday,

Charles.
(OTIS goes back into the sleeper he shares with PHILO and
closes the door.

CAROL looks at ACHERSON, troubled and sympathetic.)

CAROL: Are you coming in?

(ACHERSON does not respond, but continues to stare at the
black country rushing by.

Fade to black.)

1. INT. AEROPLANE. IN FLIGHT

The tourist class cabin of a passenger jet.
We are mainly concerned with two passengers.
ANDERSON is an Oxbridge don, a professor. He is
middle-aged, or more. He is sitting in an aisle seat,
on the left as we look down the gangway towards the
tail. MCKENDRICK is also in an aisle seat, but across
the 
gangway 
and 
one 
row 
nearer 
the 
tail.

MCKENDRICK is about forty. He is also a don, but
where 
ANDERSON gives a somewhat fastidious

impression,
MCKENDRICK is a rougher sort of diamond.
MCKENDRICK is sitting in the first row of smokers’
seats, and ANDERSON in the last row of the non-
smokers’ seats, looking aft. The plane is by no means
full. The three seats across the aisle from ANDERSON
are vacant. The seat next to ANDERSON on his right is
also vacant but the seat beyond that, by the window,
accommodates a SLEEPING MAN.
On the vacant seat between ANDERSON and the
SLEEPING MAN is lying a sex magazine of the
Penthouse type. The magazine, however, is as yet
face down.
The passengers are coming to the end of a meal.
They have trays of aeroplane food in front of them.
MCKENDRICK puts down his fork and lights a
cigarette.
ANDERSON dabs at his mouth with his napkin and
puts it down. He glances around casually and notes
the magazine next to him. He notes the SLEEPING
MAN.
MCKENDRICK has a briefcase on the seat next to him,
and from this he takes a glossy brochure. In fact, this
is quite an elaborate publication associated with a

philosophical congress. The cover of this programme
is seen to read: ‘Colloquium Philosophicum Prague
77’.
ANDERSON slides out from under his lunch tray a
brochure identical to McKendrick’s. He glances at it
for a mere moment and loses interest. He turns his
attention back to the magazine on the seat. He turns
the magazine over and notes the naked woman on its
cover. He picks the magazine up, with a further
glance at the SLEEPING MAN, and opens it to a spread
of colour photographs. Consciously or unconsciously,
he is holding the brochure in such a way as to
provide a shield for the magazine.
MCKENDRICK, casually glancing round, sees the twin
to his own brochure.

MCKENDRICK: Snap.

(ANDERSON looks up guiltily.)

ANDERSON: Ah …

(ANDERSON closes the magazine and slides it face-up under
his lunch tray.
McKendrick’s manner is extrovert. Almost breezy.
Anderson’s manner is a little vague.)

MCKENDRICK: I wasn’t sure it was you. Not a very good

likeness.

ANDERSON: I assure you this is how I look.

MCKENDRICK: I mean your photograph. (He flips his brochure

open. It contains small photographs and pen portraits of
various men and women who are in fact to be speakers at
the colloquium.) The photograph is younger.

ANDERSON: It must be an old photograph.

(MCKENDRICK gets up and comes to sit in the empty seat
across the aisle from ANDERSON.)

MCKENDRICK: (Changing seats) Bill McKendrick.

ANDERSON: How odd.

MCKENDRICK: Is it?

ANDERSON: Young therefore old. Old therefore young. Only odd

at first glance.

MCKENDRICK: Oh yes.

(ANDERSON takes a notebook, with pencil attached, from his
pocket and writes in it as he speaks.)

ANDERSON: The second glance is known as linguistic analysis.

A lot of chaps pointing out that we don’t always mean what
we say, even when we manage to say what we mean.
Personally I’m quite prepared to believe it. (He finishes
writing and closes the notebook. He glances uneasily out
of the window.) Have you noticed the way the wings keep
wagging? I try to look away and think of something else
but I am drawn back irresistibly … I wouldn’t be nervous
about flying if the wings didn’t wag. Solid steel. Thick as a
bank safe. Flexing like tree branches. It’s not natural.
There is a coldness around my heart as though I’d seen
your cigarette smoke knock against the ceiling and break
in two like a bread stick. By the way, that is a non-smoking
seat.

MCKENDRICK: Sorry.

(MCKENDRICK stubs out his cigarette. ANDERSON puts his
notebook back into his pocket.)

ANDERSON: Yes, I like to collect little curiosities for the

 language chaps. It’s like handing round a bag of liquorice
 allsorts. They’re terribly grateful. (A thought strikes him.)
 Oh, you’re not a language chap yourself?  
(The question seems to surprise MCKENDRICK, and amuse
him.)

MCKENDRICK: No. I’m McKendrick.

ANDERSON: You’ll be giving a paper?

MCKENDRICK: Yes. Nothing new, actually. More of a summing

up of my corner. My usual thing, you know …
(MCKENDRICK is fishing but ANDERSON doesn’t seem to
notice.)

ANDERSON: Jolly good.

MCKENDRICK: Perhaps you’ve come across some of my stuff …?

(ANDERSON now wakes up to the situation and is contrite.)

ANDERSON: Clearly that is a reasonable expectation. I am

sorry. I’m sure I know your name. I don’t read the
philosophical journals as much as I should, and hardly ever
go to these international bunfights. No time nowadays.
They shouldn’t call us professors. It’s more like being the
faculty almoner.

only English, actually singing for our supper, I mean. I
expect there’ll be a few others going for the free trip and
the social life. In fact, I see we’ve got one on board. At the
back.
(MCKENDRICK jerks his head towards the back of the plane.

ANDERSON turns round to look. The object of attention is

CHETWYN, asleep in the back row, on the aisle. CHETWYN is
younger than MCKENDRICK and altogether frailer and neater.

ANDERSON squints down the plane at CHETWYN.) Do you
know Prague?

wakes up to that.) Oh, Prague. Sorry. No, I’ve never been
there. (Small pause.) Or have I? I got an honorary degree
at Bratislava once. We changed planes in Prague. (Pause.)
It might have been Vienna actually. (Pause. He looks at the
window.) Wag, wag.

MCKENDRICK: It’s Andrew Chetwyn. Do you know him?

ANDERSON: (Warily) Not personally.

MCKENDRICK: I don’t know him personally. Do you know his

line at all?

ANDERSON: Not as such.

MCKENDRICK: (Suspiciously) Have you heard of him?

ANDERSON: No. In a word.

MCKENDRICK: Oh. He’s been quite public recently.

ANDERSON: He’s an ethics chap, is he?

MCKENDRICK: His line is that Aristotle got it more or less right,

and St Augustine brought it up to date.

ANDERSON: I can see that that might make him conspicuous.

MCKENDRICK: Oh, it’s not that. I mean politics. Letters to The

Times about persecuted professors with unpronounceable
names. I’m surprised the Czechs gave him a visa.

ANDERSON: There are some rather dubious things happening

in Czechoslovakia. Ethically.

MCKENDRICK: Oh yes. No doubt.

ANDERSON: We must not try to pretend otherwise.

MCKENDRICK: Oh quite. I mean I don’t. My work is pretty

political. I mean by implication, of course. As yours is. I’m
looking forward to hearing you.

ANDERSON: Thank you. I’m sure your paper will be very

interesting too.

MCKENDRICK: As a matter of fact I think there’s a lot of juice

left in the fictions problem.

ANDERSON: Is that what you’re speaking on?

MCKENDRICK: No – you are.

ANDERSON: Oh, am I? (He looks in his brochure briefly.) So I

am.

MCKENDRICK: ‘Ethical Fictions as Ethical Foundations’.

ANDERSON: Yes. To tell you the truth I have an ulterior motive

for coming to Czechoslovakia at this time. I’m being a tiny
bit naughty.

MCKENDRICK: Naughty?

government, after all.

MCKENDRICK: And what …?

ANDERSON: I don’t think I’m going to tell you. You see, if I tell

you I make you a co-conspirator whether or not you would
have wished to be one. Ethically I should give you the
opportunity of choosing to be one or not.

MCKENDRICK: Then why don’t you give me the opportunity?

ANDERSON: I can’t without telling you. An impasse.

(MCKENDRICK is already putting two and two together and
cannot hide his curiosity.)

MCKENDRICK: Look … Professor Anderson … if it’s political in

any way I’d really be very interested.

ANDERSON: Why, are you a politics chap?

in these places. And I have an academic interest – my field
is the philosophical assumptions of social science.

ANDERSON: How fascinating. What is that exactly?

MCKENDRICK: (Slightly hurt) Perhaps my paper tomorrow

afternoon will give you a fair idea.

ANDERSON: (Mortified) Tomorrow afternoon? I say, what rotten

luck. That’s exactly when I have to play truant. I am sorry.

MCKENDRICK: (Coldly) That’s all right.

ANDERSON: I expect they’ll have copies.

MCKENDRICK: I expect so.

ANDERSON: The science of social philosophy, eh?

MCKENDRICK: (Brusquely) More or less.

ANDERSON: (With polite interest) McCarthy.

MCKENDRICK: McKendrick.

ANDERSON: And how are things at … er …

MCKENDRICK: Stoke.

ANDERSON: (Enthusiastically) Stoke! An excellent university, I

believe.

MCKENDRICK: You know perfectly well you wouldn’t be seen

dead in it.
(ANDERSON considers this.)

ANDERSON: Even if that were true, my being seen dead in a

place has never so far as I know been thought a condition
of its excellence.
(MCKENDRICK despite himself laughs, though somewhat
bitterly.)

MCKENDRICK: Very good.

(An air hostess is walking down the aisle, removing
people’s lunch trays. She removes Anderson’s tray,
revealing the cover of the sexy magazine, in the middle of
McKendrick’s next speech, and passes down the aisle.)
Wit and paradox. Verbal felicity. An occupation for
gentlemen. A higher civilization alive and well in the older
universities. I see you like tits and bums, by the way.

ANDERSON: (Embarrassed) Ah …

(The turning of tables cheers MCKENDRICK up considerably.)

MCKENDRICK: They won’t let you in with that, you know. You’ll

have to hide it.

ANDERSON: As a matter of fact it doesn’t belong to me.

MCKENDRICK: Western decadence, you see. Marxists are a

terrible lot of prudes. I can say that because I’m a bit that
way myself.

ANDERSON: You surprise me.

MCKENDRICK: Mind you, when I say I’m a Marxist …

ANDERSON: Oh, I see.

MCKENDRICK: … I don’t mean I’m an apologist for everything

done in the name of Marxism.

ANDERSON: No, no quite. There’s nothing anti-socialist about

it. Quite the reverse. The rich have always had it to
themselves.

MCKENDRICK: On the contrary. That’s why I’d be really very

interested in any extra-curricular activities which might be
going. I have an open mind about it.

ANDERSON: (His wires crossed) Oh, yes, indeed, so have I.

MCKENDRICK: I sail pretty close to the wind, Marx-wise.

ANDERSON: Mind you, it’s an odd thing but travel broadens the

mind in a way that the proverbialist didn’t quite intend.
It’s only at airports and railway stations that one finds in
oneself a curiosity about er – er – erotica, um, girlie
magazines.
(MCKENDRICK realizes that they’ve had their wires crossed.)

MCKENDRICK: Perhaps you’ve come across some of my articles.

ANDERSON: (Amazed and fascinated) You mean you write for –?

(He pulls himself up and together.) Oh – your – er articles –
I’m afraid as I explained I’m not very good at keeping up
with the philosophical….
(MCKENDRICK has gone back to his former seat to fish about
in his briefcase. He emerges with another girlie magazine
and hands it along the aisle to ANDERSON.)

fiction short story. Not a bad life. Science fiction and sex.
And, of course, the philosophical assumptions of social
science.

ANDERSON: (Faintly) Thank you very much.

MCKENDRICK: Keep it by all means.

(ANDERSON cautiously thumbs through pages of naked
women.)
I wonder if there’ll be any decent women?

2. INT. HOTEL LOBBY. PRAGUE

We are 
near 
the 
reception 
desk. 
ANDERSON,

MCKENDRICK 
and 
CHETWYN 
have 
just 
arrived

together. Perhaps with other people. Their luggage
consists only of small overnight suitcases and
briefcases. MCKENDRICK is at the desk, half-way
through his negotiations. The lobby ought to be
rather large, with lifts, etc. It should be large enough
to make inconspicuous a man who is carefully
watching the three Englishmen. This man is aged
thirty-five or younger. He is poorly dressed, but not
tramp-like. His name is PAVEL HOLLAR. The lobby

contains other people and a poorly equipped news-
stand.
We catch up with ANDERSON talking to CHETWYN.

ANDERSON: 
(Enthusiastically) 
Birmingham! 
Excellent

university. Some very good people.
(The DESK CLERK comes to the counter, where MCKENDRICK is
first in the queue. The CLERK and other Czech people in
this script obviously speak with an accent, but there is no
attempt here to reproduce it.)

CLERK: Third floor. Dr McKendrick.

MCKENDRICK: Only of philosophy.

CLERK: Your baggage is there?

MCKENDRICK: (Hastily) Oh, I’ll see to that. Can I have the key,

please?

CLERK: Third floor. Dr Anderson. Ninth floor. A letter for you.

(The CLERK gives ANDERSON a sealed envelope and also a
key. ANDERSON seems to have been expecting the letter. He
thanks the CLERK and takes it.)
Dr Chetwyn. Ninth floor.
(The three philosophers walk towards the lifts. PAVEL
watches them go. When they reach the lift ANDERSON
glances round and sees two men some way off across the
lobby, perhaps at the news-stand. These men are called

CRISP and BROADBENT. CRIPS looks very young; he is twenty-
two. He wears a very smart, slightly flashy suit and tie.

BROADBENT, balding but young, is in his thirties. He wears
flannels and a blazer. CRISP is quite small. BROADBENT is big
and heavy. But both look fit.)

ANDERSON: I say, look who’s over there … Broadbent and

Crisp.
(The lift now opens before them. ANDERSON goes in showing
his key to the middle-aged woman in charge of the lift. 

MCKENDRICK and CHETWYN do likewise. Over this:)

CHETWYN: Who? (He sees them and recognizes them.) Oh yes.

MCKENDRICK: (Sees them) Who?

CHETWYN: Crisp and Broadbent. They must be staying here

too.

MCKENDRICK: Crisp? Broadbent? That kid over by the news-

stand?

ANDERSON: That’s Crisp.

MCKENDRICK: My God, they get younger all the time.

(The lift doors close.
Inside the lift.)

ANDERSON: Crisp is twenty-two. Broadbent is past his peak but

Crisp is the next genius in my opinion.

MCKENDRICK: Do you know him?

ANDERSON: Not personally. I’ve been watching him for a

couple of years.

CHETWYN: He’s Newcastle, isn’t he?

ANDERSON: Yes.

MCKENDRICK: I’ve never heard of him. What’s his role there?

in the centre. He’s an opportunist more than anything.
(The lift has stopped at the third floor.)
(To MCKENDRICK) This is you – see you later.
(MCKENDRICK steps out of the lift and looks round.)

MCKENDRICK: Do you think the rooms are bugged?

(The lift doors shut him off.
Inside the lift. ANDERSON and CHETWYN ride up in silence for
a few moments.)

the further you fall …?

CHETWYN: He was talking about tragic heroes.

(The lift stops at the ninth floor. ANDERSON and CHETWYN
leave the lift.)
I’m this way. There’s a restaurant downstairs. The menu is
very limited but it’s all right.

ANDERSON: You’ve been here before?

CHETWYN: Yes. Perhaps see you later then, sir.

(CHETWYN goes down a corridor, away from Anderson’s
corridor.)

ANDERSON: (To himself) Sir?

(ANDERSON follows the arrow towards his own room
number.)

3. INT. ANDERSON’S HOTEL ROOM

The room contains a bed, a wardrobe, a chest. A
telephone. A bathroom containing a bath leads off
through a door. ANDERSON is unpacking. He puts

some clothes into a drawer and closes it. His suitcase
is open on the bed. ANDERSON turns his attention to
his briefcase and brings out McKendrick’s magazine.
He looks round, wondering what to do with it. There
is a knock on the door. ANDERSON tosses the girlie
magazine into his suitcase and closes the case. He
goes to open the door. The caller is PAVEL HOLLAR.

ANDERSON: Yes?

HOLLAR: I am Pavel Hollar.

ANDERSON: Yes?

HOLLAR: Professor Anderson.
(HOLLAR is Czech and speaks with an accent.)

ANDERSON: Hollar? Oh, heavens, yes. How extraordinary.

Come in.

HOLLAR: Thank you. I’m sorry to –

ANDERSON: No, no – what a pleasant surprise. I’ve only just

arrived, as you can see. Sit where you can. How are you?
What are you doing? You live in Prague?

HOLLAR: Oh yes.

(ANDERSON closes the door.)

ANDERSON: Well, well. Well, well, well, well. How are you?

Must be ten years.

HOLLAR: Yes. It is ten. I took my degree in sixty-seven.

ANDERSON: You got a decent degree, too, didn’t you?

HOLLAR: Yes, I got a first.

ANDERSON: Of course you did. Well done, well done. Are you

still in philosophy?

HOLLAR: No, unfortunately.

ANDERSON: Ah. What are you doing now?

HOLLAR: I am a, what do you say – a cleaner.

ANDERSON: (With intelligent interest) A cleaner? What is that?

HOLLAR: (Surprised) Cleaning. Washing. With a brush and a

bucket. I am a cleaner at the bus station.

ANDERSON: You wash buses?

HOLLAR: No, not buses – the lavatories, the floors where

people walk and so on.

ANDERSON: Oh. I see. You’re a cleaner.

HOLLAR: Yes.

(Pause.)

ANDERSON: Are you married now, or anything?

HOLLAR: Yes. I married. She was almost my fiancée when I

went to England. Irma. She is a country girl. No English.
No philosophy. We have a son who is Sacha. That is
Alexander.

ANDERSON: I see.

HOLLAR: And Mrs Anderson?

ANDERSON: She died. Did you meet her ever?

HOLLAR: No.

ANDERSON: (Pause) I don’t know what to say.

HOLLAR: Did she die recently?

ANDERSON: No, I mean – a cleaner.

HOLLAR: I had one year graduate research. My doctorate

studies were on certain connections with Thomas Paine
and Locke. But then, since sixty-nine …

ANDERSON: Cleaning lavatories.

HOLLAR: First I was in a bakery. Later on construction,

building houses. Many other things. It is the way it is for
many people.

ANDERSON: Is it all right for you to be here talking to me?

HOLLAR: Of course. Why not? You are my old professor.

(HOLLAR is carrying a bag or briefcase. He puts this down
and opens it.)
I have something here.
(From the bag he takes out of the sort of envelope which
would contain about thirty type-written foolscap pages. He
also takes out a child’s ‘magic eraser’ pad, the sort of pad
on which one scratches a message and then slides it out to
erase it.)
You understand these things of course?

ANDERSON: (Nonplussed) Er …

HOLLAR: (Smiling) Of course.

(HOLLAR demonstrates the pad briefly, then writes on the
pad while Anderson watches.)

ANDERSON: (Stares at him) To England?

(HOLLAR abandons the use of the pad, and whispers in

ANDERSON’s ear.)

HOLLAR: Excuse me.

(HOLLAR goes to the door and opens it for ANDERSON. HOLLAR
carries his envelope but leaves his bag in the room.

ANDERSON goes out of the door baffled. HOLLAR follows him.
They walk a few paces down the corridor.)
Thank you. It is better to be careful.

ANDERSON: Why? You don’t seriously suggest that my room is

bugged?

HOLLAR: It is better to assume it.

ANDERSON: Why?

(Just then the door of the room next to Anderson’s opens
and a man comes out. He is about forty and wears a dark
rather shapeless suit. He glances at ANDERSON and HOLLAR.
And then walks off in the opposite direction towards the
lift and passes out of sight. 
HOLLAR and 
ANDERSON

instinctively pause until the man has gone.)
I hope you’re not getting me into trouble.

HOLLAR: I hope not. I don’t think so. I have friends in trouble.

ANDERSON: I know, it’s dreadful – but … well, what is it?

(HOLLAR indicates his envelope.)

HOLLAR: My doctoral thesis. It is mainly theoretical. Only ten

thousand words, but very formally arranged.

ANDERSON: My goodness … ten years in the writing.

HOLLAR: No. I wrote it this month – when I heard of this

congress here and you coming. I decided. Every day in the
night.

ANDERSON: Of course. I’d be very happy to read it.

HOLLAR: It is in Czech.

ANDERSON: Oh … well …?

you remember – we came together in sixty-three –

ANDERSON: Oh yes – Volkansky – yes, I do remember him. He

never came back here.

HOLLAR: No. He didn’t come back. He was a realist.

ANDERSON: He’s at Reading or somewhere like that.

HOLLAR: Lyster.

ANDERSON: Leicester. Exactly. Are you in touch with him?

HOLLAR: A little. He will translate it and try to have it

published in English. If it’s good. I think it is good.

ANDERSON: But can’t you publish it in Czech? … (This catches

up on him and he shakes his head.) Oh, Hollar … now, you
know, really, I’m a guest of the government here.

HOLLAR: They would not search you.

ANDERSON: That’s not the point. I’m sorry … I mean it would

be bad manners, wouldn’t it?

HOLLAR: Bad manners?

ANDERSON: I know it sounds rather lame. But ethics and

manners are interestingly related. The history of human
calumny is largely a series of breaches of good manners….
(Pause.) Perhaps if I said correct behaviour it wouldn’t
sound so ridiculous. You do see what I mean. I am sorry….
Look, can we go back … I ought to unpack.

HOLLAR: My thesis is about correct behaviour.

ANDERSON: Oh yes?

what is correct for the state.

ANDERSON: Yes, I know.

HOLLAR: I ask how collective right can have meaning by itself.

I ask where it comes from, the idea of a collective ethic.

ANDERSON: Yes.

HOLLAR: I reply, it comes from the individual. One man’s

dealings with another man.

ANDERSON: Yes.

HOLLAR: The collective ethic can only be the individual ethic

writ big.

ANDERSON: Writ large.

HOLLAR: Writ large, precisely. The ethics of the state must be

judged against the fundamental ethic of the individual. The
human being, not the citizen. I conclude there is an
obligation, a human responsibility, to fight against the
state correctness. Unfortunately that is not a safe
conclusion.

ANDERSON: Quite. The difficulty arises when one asks oneself

how the individual ethic can have any meaning by itself.
Where does that come from? In what sense is it
intelligible, for example, to say that a man has certain
inherent, individual rights? It is much easier to understand
how a community of individuals can decide to give each
other certain rights. These rights may or may not include,
for example, the right to publish something. In that
situation, the individual ethic would flow from the
collective ethic, just as the state says it does. (Pause.) I
only mean it is a question you would have to deal with.

HOLLAR: I mean, it is not safe for me.

ANDERSON: (Still misunderstanding) Well yes, but for example,

you could say that such an arrangement between a man
and the state is a sort of contract, and it is the essence of a
contract that both parties enter into it freely. And you have
not entered into it freely. I mean, that would be one line of
attack.

HOLLAR: It is not the main line. You see, to me the idea of an

inherent right is intelligible. I believe that we have such
rights, and they are paramount.

ANDERSON: Yes, I see you do, but how do you justify the

assertion?

HOLLAR: I observe. I observe my son for example.

ANDERSON: Your son?

HOLLAR: For example.

(Pause.)

ANDERSON: Look, there’s no need to stand out here. There’s …

no point. I was going to have a bath and change … meeting
some of my colleagues later …
(ANDERSON moves to go but HOLLAR stops him with a touch
on the arm.)

HOLLAR: I am not a famous dissident. A writer, a scientist …

ANDERSON: No.

HOLLAR: If I am picked up – on the way home, let us say –

there is no fuss. A cleaner. I will be one of hundreds. It’s
all right. In the end it must change. But I have something
to say – that is all. If I leave my statement behind, then it’s
OK. You understand?

ANDERSON: Perhaps the correct thing for me to have done is

not to have accepted their invitation to speak here. But I
did accept it. It is a contract, as it were, freely entered
into. And having accepted their hospitality I cannot in all
conscience start smuggling … It’s just not ethical.

HOLLAR: But if you didn’t know you were smuggling it –

ANDERSON: Smuggling entails knowledge.

HOLLAR: If I hid my thesis in your luggage, for instance.

ANDERSON: That’s childish. Also, you could be getting me into

trouble, and your quarrel is not with me. Your action would
be unethical on your own terms – one man’s dealings with
another man. I am sorry.

(ANDERSON goes back towards his door, which HOLLAR had
left ajar. HOLLAR follows him.)

HOLLAR: No, it is I who must apologize. The man next door, is

he one of your group?

ANDERSON: No. I don’t know him. (ANDERSON opens his

bedroom door. He turns as if to say goodbye.)

HOLLAR: My bag.

ANDERSON: Oh yes.

(HOLLAR follows ANDERSON into the room.)

HOLLAR: You will have a bath …?

ANDERSON: I thought I would.
(HOLLAR turns into the bathroom. ANDERSON stays in the

bedroom, surprised. He hears the bath water being turned
on. The bath water makes a rush of sound. ANDERSON enters
the bathroom and sees HOLLAR sitting on the edge of the
bath. Interior bathroom.)

HOLLAR: (Quietly) I have not yet made a copy.

ANDERSON: (Loudly) What?

(HOLLAR goes up to 
ANDERSON and speaks close to

ANDERSON’s ear. The bath taps make a loud background
noise.)

HOLLAR: I have not yet made a copy. I have a bad feeling about

carrying this home. (He indicates his envelope.) I did not
expect to take it away. I ask a favour. (Smiles.) Ethical.

ANDERSON: (Quietly now) What is it?

HOLLAR: Let me leave this here and you can bring it to my

apartment tomorrow – I have a safe place for it there.
(HOLLAR takes a piece of paper and a pencil from his pocket
and starts writing his address in capital letters.)

ANDERSON: But you know my time here is very crowded –

(Then he gives in.) Do you live nearby?

HOLLAR: It is not far. I have written my address.

(HOLLAR gives ANDERSON the paper.)

ANDERSON: (Forgetting to be quiet) Do you seriously –

(HOLLAR quietens ANDERSON.)
Do you seriously expect to be searched on the way home?

HOLLAR: I don’t know, but it is better to be careful. I wrote a

letter to Mr Husak. Also some other things. So sometimes
they follow me.

ANDERSON: But you weren’t worried about bringing the thesis

with you.

HOLLAR: No. If anybody watches me they want to know what

books you give me.

ANDERSON: I see. Yes, all right, Hollar. I’ll bring it tomorrow.

Take your briefcase.
(They go back into the bedroom. ANDERSON puts Hollar’s
envelope into his briefcase.)
(Normal voice) So perhaps you will come and meet my
wife.

ANDERSON: Yes. Should I telephone?

HOLLAR: Unfortunately my telephone is removed. I am home

all day. Saturday.

ANDERSON: Oh yes.

HOLLAR: Goodbye.

ANDERSON: Goodbye.

(HOLLAR goes to the door, carrying his bag.)

HOLLAR: I forgot – welcome to Prague.

(HOLLAR leaves, closing the door.

ANDERSON stands still for a few moments. Then he hears
footsteps approaching down the corridor. The footsteps
appear to stop outside his room. But then the door to the
next room is opened and the unseen man enters the room
next door and loudly closes the door behind him.)

4. INT. ANDERSON’S ROOM. MORNING

Close-up of the colloquium brochure. It is lying on
Anderson’s table, Then ANDERSON picks it up. His
dress and appearance, and the light outside the
window, tell us that it is morning. Dressed to go out,
ANDERSON picks up his briefcase and leaves the
room.
In the corridor he walks towards the lifts.
At the lifts he finds CRISP waiting. ANDERSON stands
next to CRISP silently for a few moments.

ANDERSON: Good morning. (Pause.) Mr Crisp … my name is

Anderson. I’m a very great admirer of yours.

CRISP: (Chewing gum) Oh … ta.

ANDERSON: Good luck this afternoon.

CRISP: Thanks. Bloody useless, the lifts in this place.

ANDERSON: Are you all staying in this hotel?

(CRISP doesn’t seem to hear this. CRISP sees BROADBENT
emerging from a room. BROADBENT carries a zipped bag.

CRISP has a similar bag.)

CRISP: (Shouts) Here you are, Roy – it’s waiting for you.

(BROADBENT arrives.)

ANDERSON: Good morning. Good luck this afternoon.

BROADBENT: Right. Thanks. Are you over for the match?

ANDERSON: Yes. Well, partly. I’ve got my ticket.

(ANDERSON takes out of his pocket the envelope he received
from the hotel CLERK and shows it.)

CRISP: (Quietly) You didn’t pull her, then?

BROADBENT: No chance.

CRISP: They don’t trust you, do they?

BROADBENT: Well, they’re right, aren’t they? Remember Milan.

CRISP: (Laughing) Yeah –

(The bell sounds to indicate that the lift is arriving.)
About bloody time.

ANDERSON: I see from yesterday’s paper that they’ve brought

in Jirasek for Vladislav.

BROADBENT: Yes, that’s right. Six foot eight, they say.

ANDERSON: He’s not very good in the air unless he’s got lots of

space.
(BROADBENT looks at him curiously. The lift doors open and
the three of them get in. There is no one else in the lift
except the female OPERATOR.
Interior lift.)

BROADBENT: You’ve seen him, have you?

ANDERSON: I’ve seen him twice. In the UEFA Cup a few

seasons ago…. I happened to be in Berlin for the Hegel
Colloquium, er, bunfight. And then last season I was in
Bratislava to receive an honorary degree.

CRISP: Tap his ankles for him. Teach him to be six foot eight.

BROADBENT: Leave off – (He nods at the LIFT OPERATOR.) You

never know, do you?

CRISP: Yeah, maybe the lift’s bugged.

ANDERSON: He scored both times from the same move, and

came close twice more –

BROADBENT: Oh yes?

(Pause.)

ANDERSON: (In a rush) I realize it’s none of my business – I

mean you may think I’m an absolute ass, but – (Pause.)
Look, if Halas takes a corner he’s going to make it short –
almost certainly – push it back to Deml or Kautsky, who
pulls the defence out. Jirasek hangs about for the chip to
the far post. They’ll do the same thing from a set piece.
Three or four times in the same match. Really. Short
corners and free kicks.
(The lift stops at the third floor. BROADBENT and CRISP are
staring at ANDERSON.)
(Lamely) Anyway, that’s why they’ve brought Jirasek back,
in my opinion.
(The lift doors open and MCKENDRICK gets in. McKendrick’s
manner is breezy and bright.)

MCKENDRICK: Good morning! You’ve got together then?

ANDERSON: A colleague. Mr McKendrick …

MCKENDRICK: You’re Crisp. (He takes CRISP’s hand and shakes

it.) Bill McKendrick. I hear you’re doing some very
interesting work in Newcastle. Great stuff. I still like to
think of myself as a bit of a left-winger at Stoke. Of course,
my stuff is largely empirical – I leave epistemological
questions to the scholastics – eh, Anderson? (He pokes

ANDERSON in the ribs.)

ANDERSON: McKendrick …

BROADBENT: Did you say Stoke?

(The lift arrives at the ground floor.)

MCKENDRICK: (To BROADBENT) We’ve met, haven’t we? Your face

is familiar …
(BROADBENT, CRISP and MCKENDRICK in close attendance leave
the lift. ANDERSON is slow on the uptake but follows.)

ANDERSON: McKendrick –?

MCKENDRICK: (Prattling) There’s a choice of open forums

tonight – neo-Hegelians or Quinian neo-Positivists. Which
do you fancy? Pity Quine couldn’t be here. And Hegel for
that matter.
(MCKENDRICK laughs brazenly in the lobby. BROADBENT and

CRISP eye him warily. ANDERSON winces.)

5. INT. THE COLLOQUIUM

The general idea is that a lot of philosophers sit in a
sort of theatre while on stage one of their number
reads a paper from behind a lectern, with a
CHAIRMAN in attendance behind him. The set-up,
however, is quite complicated. To one side are three
glassed-in-booths, each one containing ‘simultaneous
interpreters’. These interpreters have earphones and
microphones. They also have a copy of the lecture
being given. One of these interpreters is translating
into Czech, another into French, another into
German. The audience is furnished with earphones
or with those hand-held phones which are issued in
theatres sometimes. Each of these phones can tune
into any of the three interpreters, depending upon
the language of the listener. For our purposes it is
better to have the hand-held phones.
It is important to the play, specifically to a later
scene when ANDERSON is talking, that the hall and
the audience should be substantial.
At the moment ANDERSON is in the audience, sitting
next 
to 
MCKENDRICK. 
MCKENDRICK 
is 
still

discomfited. CHETWYN is elsewhere in the audience.
We begin, however, with a large close-up of the
speaker, who is an American called STONE. After the
first sentence or two of Stone’s speech, the camera
will acquaint us with the situation. At different points
during Stone’s speech, there is conversation between
ANDERSON and MCKENDRICK. In this script, these
conversations are placed immediately after that part
of Stone’s speech which they will cover. This applies
also to any other interpolations. Obviously, STONE
does not pause to let these other things in.

STONE: The confusion which often arises from the ambiguity

of ordinary language raises special problems for a logical

language. This is especially so when the ambiguity is not
casual and inadvertent – but when it’s contrived. In fact,
the limitations of a logical language are likely to appear
when we ask ourselves whether it can accommodate a
literature, or whether poetry can be reduced to a logical
language. It is here that deliberate ambiguity for effect
makes problems.

ANDERSON: Perfectly understandable mistake.

STONE: Nor must we confuse ambiguity, furthermore, with

mere synonymity. When we say that a politician ran for
office, that is not an ambiguous statement, it is merely an
instance of a word having different applications, literal,
idiomatic and so on.

MCKENDRICK: I said I knew his face.

ANDERSON: ‘Match of the Day’.

STONE: The intent is clear in each application. The show ran

well on Broadway. Native Dancer ran well at Kentucky, and
so on. (In the audience a Frenchman expresses dismay and
bewilderment as his earphones give out a literal
translation of ‘a native dancer’ running well at Kentucky.
Likewise a German listener has the same problem.)
And what about this word ‘Well’? Again, it is applied as a
qualifier with various intent – the show ran for a long time,
the horse ran fast, and so on.

MCKENDRICK: So this pressing engagement of yours is a

football match.

ANDERSON: A World Cup qualifier is not just a football match.

STONE: Again, there is no problem here so long as these

variations are what I propose to call reliable. ‘You eat
well,’ says Mary to John. ‘You cook well,’ says John to
Mary. We know that when Mary says, ‘You eat well’, she
does not mean that John eats skilfully. Just as we know that
when John says, ‘You cook well’, he does not mean that
Mary cooks abundantly.

ANDERSON: But I’m sorry about missing your paper, I really

am.

STONE: I say that we know this, but I mean only that our

general experience indicates it. The qualifier takes its
meaning from the contextual force of the verb it qualifies.
But it is the mark of a sound theory that it should take

account not merely of our general experience but also of
the particular experience, and not merely of the particular
experience but also of the unique experience, and not
merely of the unique experience but also of the
hypothetical experience. It is when we consider the world
of possibilities, hypothetical experience, that we get closer
to ambiguity. ‘You cook well,’ says John to Mary. ‘You eat
well,’ says Mary to John.

MCKENDRICK: Do you ever wonder whether all this is

worthwhile?

ANDERSON: No.

MCKENDRICK: I know what you mean.

(CHETWYN is twisting the knob on his translation phone, to
try all this out in different languages. He is clearly bored.
He looks at his watch.)

STONE: No problems there. But I ask you to imagine a

competition when what is being judged is table manners.
(Insert French interpreter’s box – interior.)

INTERPRETER: … bonne tenue à table …

STONE: John enters this competition and afterwards Mary

says, ‘Well, you certainly ate well!’ Now Mary seems to be
saying that John ate skilfully – with refinement. And again,
I ask you to imagine a competition where the amount of
food eaten is taken into account along with refinement of
table manners. Now Mary says to John, ‘Well, you didn’t
eat very well, but at least you ate well.’

INTERPRETER: Alors, vous n’avez pas bien mangé … mais …

(All INTERPRETERS baffled by this.)

STONE: Now clearly there is no way to tell whether Mary

means that John ate abundantly but clumsily, or that John
ate frugally but elegantly. Here we have a genuine
ambiguity. To restate Mary’s sentence in a logical
language we would have to ask her what she meant.

MCKENDRICK: By the way, I’ve got you a copy of my paper.

ANDERSON: Oh, many thanks.

MCKENDRICK: It’s not a long paper. You could read it

comfortably during half-time.
(MCKENDRICK gives ANDERSON his paper.)

STONE: But this is to assume that Mary exists. Let us say she

is a fictitious character in a story I have written. Very well,

you say to me, the author, ‘What did Mary mean? Well, I
might reply – ‘I don’t know what she meant. Her ambiguity
makes the necessary point of my story.’ And here I think
the idea of a logical language which can only be
unambiguous breaks down.
(ANDERSON opens his briefcase and puts McKendrick’s
paper into it. He fingers Hollar’s envelope and broods over
it. STONE has concluded. He sits dawn to applause. The

CHAIRMAN, who has been sitting behind him, has stood up.)

ANDERSON: I’m going to make a discreet exit – I’ve got a call to

make before the match.
(ANDERSON stands up.)

CHAIRMAN: Yes – Professor Anderson I think …?

(ANDERSON is caught like a rabbit in the headlights.

MCKENDRICK 
enjoys 
his 
predicament 
and 
becomes

interested in how ANDERSON will deal with it.)

ANDERSON: Ah … I would only like to offer Professor Stone the

observation that language is not the only level of human
communication, and perhaps not the most important level.
Whereof we cannot speak, thereof we are by no means
silent.
(MCKENDRICK smiles ‘Bravo’.)
Verbal language is a technical refinement of our capacity
for communication, rather than the fons et origo of that
capacity The likelihood is that language develops in an ad
hoc way, so there is no reason to expect its development to
be logical. (A thought strikes him.) The importance of
language is overrated. It allows me and Professor Stone to
show off a bit, and it is very useful for communicating
detail – but the important truths are simple and
monolithic. The essentials of a given situation speak for
themselves, and language is as capable of obscuring the
truth as of revealing it. Thank you.
(ANDERSON edges his way out towards the door.)

CHAIRMAN: (Uncertainly) Professor Stone …

STONE: Well, what was the question?

6. INT. FRONT DOOR OF THE HOLLAR APARTMENT

The apartment is one of two half-way up a large old

building. The stairwell is dirty and uncared for. The
Hollar front door is on a landing, and the front door
of another flat is across the landing. Stairs go up and
down. ANDERSON comes up the stairs and finds the
right number on the door and rings the bell. He is
carrying his briefcase. All the men in this scene are
Czech 
plain-clothes 
POLICEMEN. 
They 
will 
be

identified in this text merely by number. MAN 3 is the
one in charge.

MAN 1: comes to the door.

ANDERSON: I’m looking for Mr Hollar.

(MAN 1 shakes his head. He looks behind him. MAN 2 comes
to the door.)

MAN 2:(In Czech) Yes? Who are you?

ANDERSON: 
English? 
Um. 
Parlez-vous 
français? 
Er.

Spreckanzydoitch?

MAN 2: (In German) Deutsch? Ein Bischen.

ANDERSON: Actually I don’t. Does Mr Hollar live here?

Apartment Hollar?
(MAN 2 speaks to somebody behind him.)

MAN 2: (In Czech) An Englishman. Do you know him?

(MRS HOLLAR comes to the door. She is about the same age
as HOLLAR.)

ANDERSON: Mrs Hollar?

(MRS HOLLAR nods.)
Is your husband here? Pavel …

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) Pavel is arrested.

(Inside, behind the door, MAN 3 is heard shouting, in
Czech.)

MAN 3: (Not seen) What’s going on there?

(MAN 3 comes to the door.)

ANDERSON: I am looking for Mr Hollar. I am a friend from

England. His Professor. My name is Anderson.

MAN 3: (In English) Not here. (In Czech to MRS HOLLAR.) He

says he is a friend of your husband. Anderson.

ANDERSON: He was my student.

(MRS HOLLAR calls out.)

MAN 3: (In Czech) Shut up.

ANDERSON: Student. Philosophy.

(MRS HOLLAR calls out.)

MAN 3: Shut Up.

(MAN 3 and MAN 2 come out of the flat on to the landing,
closing the door behind them.)

minute. I have a taxi waiting. Taxi.

MAN 3: Taxi.

ANDERSON: Yes. I can’t stay.

MAN 3: (In English) Moment. OK.

ANDERSON: I can’t stay.

(MAN 3 rings the bell of the adjacent flat. A rather scared
woman opens the door. MAN 3 asks, in Czech, to use the
phone. MAN 3 goes inside the other flat. ANDERSON begins to
realize the situation.) Well, look, if you don’t mind – I’m on
my way to – an engagement …

MAN 2: (In Czech) Stay here.

(Pause. ANDERSON looks at his watch. Then from inside the
flat MRS HOLLAR is shouting in Czech.)

MRS HOLLAR: (Unseen) I’m entitled to a witness of my choice.

(The 
door 
is 
opened 
violently 
and 
immediately

slammed. ANDERSON becomes agitated.)

ANDERSON: What’s going on in there?

MAN 2: (In Czech) Stay here, he won’t be a minute.

(ANDERSON can hear MRS HOLLAR shouting.)

ANDERSON: Now look here –

(ANDERSON rings the doorbell. The door is opened by MAN
4.)
I demand to speak to Mrs Hollar.
(Upstairs and downstairs doors are opening and people
are shouting, in Czech, ‘What’s going on?’ And so on.
There is also shouting from inside the flat. MAN 2 shouts up
and down the staircase, in Czech.)

MAN 2: (In Czech) Go inside!

ANDERSON: Now look here, I am the J. S. Mill Professor of

Ethics at the University of Cambridge and I demand that I
be 
allowed 
to 
leave 
or 
to 
telephone 
the 
British

Ambassador!

MAN 4: (In Czech) Bring him inside.

MAN 2: (In Czech) In.

(He pushes ANDERSON into the flat. Interior flat. The

hallway Inside it is apparent that the front door leads to
more than one flat. Off the very small dirty hall there is a
kitchen, a lavatory and two other doors, not counting the
door to the Hollar rooms.)

MAN 4: (In Czech) Stay with him.

(The Hollar interior door is opened from inside by MRS

HOLLAR.)

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) If he’s my witness he’s allowed in

here.

MAN 4: (In Czech) Go inside – he’s not your witness.

(MAN 4 pushes MRS HOLLAR inside and closes the door from
within. This leaves ANDERSON and MAN 2 in the little hall.
Another door now opens, and a small girl, poorly dressed,
looks round it. She is jerked back out of sight by someone
and the door is pulled closed. The Hollar door is flung
open again, by MRS HOLLAR.)

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) I want this door open.

MAN 2: (In Czech) Leave it open, then. He’ll be back in a

minute.
(MAN 4 disappears back inside the flat. MRS HOLLAR is
heard.)

MRS HOLLAR: (Unseen. In Czech) Bastards.

(ANDERSON stands in the hallway. He can hear MRS HOLLAR
starting to cry. ANDERSON looks completely out of his
depth.)

ANDERSON: My God …

(Then the doorbell rings, MAN 2 opens it to let in MAN 3.)

MAN 2: (In Czech) We had to come in to shut her up.

MAN 3: (In Czech) Well, he’s coming over. (In English

to ANDERSON.) Captain coming. Speak English.

ANDERSON: I would like to telephone the British Ambassador.

MAN 3: (In English) OK. Captain coming.

ANDERSON: How long will he be? I have an appointment. (He

looks at his watch.) Yes, by God! I do have an engagement
and it starts in half an hour –

MAN 3: (In English) Please.

(A lavatory flushes. From the other interior door an OLD

MAN comes out. MAN 3 nods curtly at the OLD MAN. The OLD

MAN shuffles by looking at ANDERSON. MAN 3 becomes
uneasy at being in the traffic. He decides to bring

ANDERSON inside the flat. He does so.
Interior Hollar’s room. There are two connecting rooms.
Beyond this room is a door leading to a bedroom. This
door is open. The rooms seem full of people. The rooms
are small and shabby. They are being thoroughly searched,
and obviously have been in this process for hours. The
searchers do not spoil or destroy anything. There are no
torn cushions or anything like that. However‚ the floor of
the first room is almost covered in books. The bookcases
which line perhaps two of the walls are empty. The rug
could be rolled up, and there could be one or two
floorboards up.

MAN 1 is going through the books, leafing through each
one and looking along the spine. He is starting to put
books back on the shelves one by one. MAN 5 has emptied
drawers of their contents and is going through a pile of
papers. MRS HOLLAR stands in the doorway between the two
rooms. Beyond her MAN 2 can be seen searching. [MAN 4 is
out of sight in the bedroom.] MAN 3 indicates a chair on
which ANDERSON should sit. ANDERSON sits, putting his
briefcase on the floor by his feet. He looks around.
He sees a clock showing 2.35.
Mix to clock showing 2.55.

ANDERSON is where he was. MAN 1 is still on the books. MAN
5 is still looking through papers. MAN 3 is examining the
inside of a radio set.
Voices are heard faintly on the stairs. There is a man
remonstrating. A woman’s voice, too.
The doorbell rings.

MAN 3 leaves the room, closing the door. ANDERSON hears
him go to the front door. There is some conversation. The
front door closes again and MAN 3 re-enters the room.)

MAN 3: (In English to ANDERSON) Taxi.

ANDERSON: Oh – I forgot him. Dear me.

MAN 3: OK.

ANDERSON: I must pay him.

(ANDERSON takes out his wallet, MAN 3 takes it from him
without snatching.)

MAN 3: OK.

(MAN 3 looks through the wallet.)

ANDERSON: Give that back – (Furious) Now, you listen to me

this has gone on quite long enough – I demand – to be
allowed to leave …
(ANDERSON has stood up. MAN 3 gently pushes him back into
the chair. In Anderson’s wallet MAN 3 finds his envelope
and discovers the football ticket. He puts it back. He looks
sympathetically at ANDERSON.)

MAN 3: (In Czech) The old boy’s got a ticket for the England

match. No wonder he’s furious. (He gives the wallet back
to ANDERSON. In English) Taxi OK. No money. He go.
Football no good.

ANDERSON: Serve me right.

MAN 5: (In Czech) It’s on the radio. Let him have it on.

(MAN 3 returns to the radio and turns it on. 

MRS HOLLAR enters quickly from the bedroom and turns it
off.)

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) That’s my radio.

MAN 3: (In Czech) Your friend wants to listen to the match.

(MRS HOLLAR looks at ANDERSON. She turns the radio on. The
radio is talking about the match, which is just about to
begin.)

MAN 3: (In English) Is good. OK?

(ANDERSON, listening, realizes that the radio is listing the
names of the English team.
Then the match begins. 
Mix to:
The same situation about half an hour later. The radio is
still on. MAN 1 is still on the books. He has put aside three
or four English books. MAN 5 has disappeared. MAN 2 is
sorting out the fluff from a carpet sweeper. MAN 4 is
standing on a chair, examining the inside of a ventilation
grating.

ANDERSON gets up off his chair and starts to walk towards
the bedroom. The three MEN in the room look up but don’t
stop him. ANDERSON enters the bedroom. 
Interior bedroom.

MAN 3 is going through pockets in a wardrobe. MAN 5 is
looking  under floorboards. MRS HOLLAR is sitting on the
bed, watching  them.)

ANDERSON: It’s half-past three. I demand to be allowed to

leave or to telephone the British –

MAN 3: Please – too slow.

ANDERSON: I demand to leave –

MAN 3: OK. Who wins football?

ANDERSON: (Pause) No score.

(The doorbell goes. 

MAN 3 goes into the other room and to the door. ANDERSON
follows him as far as the other room. On the way through

MAN 3 signals to turn off the radio. MAN 2 turns off the
radio. MRS HOLLAR comes in and turns the radio on.)

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) Show me where it says I can’t listen to

my own radio.
(MAN 3 returns from the front door with MAN 6. MAN 6
enters the room, saying:)

MAN 6: (In Czech) I said don’t let him leave – I didn’t say

bring him inside. (To ANDERSON in English.) Professor
Anderson? I’m sorry your friend Mr Hollar has got himself
into trouble.

ANDERSON: Thank Christ – now listen to me – I am a professor

of  philosophy. I am a guest of the Czechoslovakian
 government. I might almost say an honoured guest. I have
 been invited to speak at the Colloquium in Prague. My
 connections in England reach up to the highest in the land

MAN 6: Do you know the Queen?

ANDERSON: Certainly. (But he has rushed into that.) No, I do

not  know the Queen – but I speak the truth when I say
that I am personally acquainted with two members of the
government,  one of whom has been to my house, and I
assure you that  unless I am allowed to leave this building
immediately there  is going to be a major incident about
the way my liberty has  been impeded by your men. I do
not know what they are  doing here, I do not care what
they are doing here –

MAN 6: Excuse me, Professor. There is some mistake. I

thought you were here as a friend of the Hollar family.

ANDERSON: I know Pavel Hollar, certainly.

MAN 6: Absolutely. You are here as a friend, at Mrs Hollar’s

request.

ANDERSON: I just dropped in to – what do you mean?

MAN 6: Mr Hollar unfortunately has been arrested for a

serious crime against the state. It is usual for the home of
an accused person to be searched for evidence, and so on.
I am sure the same thing happens in your country. Well,
under our law Mrs Hollar is entitled to have a friendly
witness present during the search. To be frank, she is
entitled to two witnesses. So if, for example, an expensive
vase is broken by mistake, and the police claim it was
broken before, it will not just be her word against theirs.
And so on. I think you will agree that’s fair.

ANDERSON: Well?

MAN 6: Well, my understanding is that she asked you to be

her witness. (In Czech to MRS HOLLAR) Did you ask him to be
your witness?

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) Yes, I did.

MAN 6: (In English to ANDERSON) Yes. Exactly so. (Pause.) You

are Mr Hollar’s friend, aren’t you?

ANDERSON: I taught him in Cambridge after he left

Czechoslovakia.

MAN 6: A brave man.

ANDERSON: Yes … a change of language … and … culture …

MAN 6: He walked across a minefield. In 1962. Brave.

ANDERSON: Perhaps he was simply desperate.

MAN 6: Perhaps a little ungrateful. The state, you know,

educated him, fed him, for eighteen years. ‘Thank you very
much – goodbye.’

ANDERSON: Well he came back, in the spring of sixty-eight.

MAN 6: Oh yes.

ANDERSON: A miscalculation.

MAN 6: How do you mean?

ANDERSON: Well, really … there are a lot of things wrong in

England but it is still not ‘a serious crime against the state’
to put forward a philosophical view which does not find
favour with the government.

MAN 6: Professor … Hollar is charged with currency offences.
There is a black market in hard currency. It is illegal. We do

not have laws about philosophy. He is an ordinary criminal.
(Pause. 
The radio commentary has continued softly. But in this
pause it changes pitch. It is clear to ANDERSON, and to us,
that something particular has occurred in the match. MAN

6 is listening.)
(In English) Penalty. (He listens for a moment.) For us, I’m
afraid.

ANDERSON: Yes, I can hear.

(This is because it is clear from the crowd noise that it’s a
penalty for the home side. MAN 6 listens again.)

MAN 6: (In English) Broadbent – a bad tackle when Deml had

a certain goal … a what you call it? – a necessary foul.

ANDERSON: A professional foul.

MAN 6: Yes.

(On the radio the goal is scored. This is perfectly clear
from the crowd reaction.)
Not good for you.
(MAN 6 turns off the radio. Pause. MAN 6 considers

ANDERSON.)
So you have had a philosophical discussion with Hollar.

stands up.) I am quite sure you know that Hollar visited
me at my hotel last night. It was a social call, which I was
returning when I walked into this. And, furthermore, I
understood nothing about being a witness – I was
prevented from leaving I only came to say hello, and meet
Pavel’s wife, on my way to the football –

MAN 6: (With surprise) So you came to Czechoslovakia to go

to the football match, Professor?
(This rattles ANDERSON.)

ANDERSON: 
Certainly 
not. 
Well, 
the 
afternoon 
of 
the

Colloquium was devoted to – well, it was not a condition of
my invitation that I should attend all the sessions. (Pause.)
I was invited to speak, not to listen. I am speaking
tomorrow morning.

MAN 6: Why should I know Hollar visited you at the hotel?

ANDERSON: He told me he was often followed.

MAN 6: Well, when a man is known to be engaged in meeting

foreigners to buy currency –

ANDERSON: I don’t believe any of that – he was being harassed

because of his letter to Husak –

MAN 6: A letter to President Husak? What sort of letter?

ANDERSON: (Flustered) Your people knew about it –

MAN 6: It is not a crime to write to the President –

ANDERSON: No doubt that depends on what is written.

MAN 6: You mean he wrote some kind of slander?

ANDERSON: (Heatedly) I insist on leaving now.

MAN 6: Of course. You know, your taxi driver has made a

complaint against you.

ANDERSON: What are you talking about?

MAN 6: He never got paid.

ANDERSON: Yes, I’m sorry but –

MAN 6: You are not to blame. My officer told him to go.

ANDERSON: Yes, that’s right.

MAN 6: Still, he is very unhappy. You told him you would be

five minutes, you were delivering something –

ANDERSON: How could I have told him that? I don’t speak

Czech.

MAN 6: You showed him five on your watch, and you did all

the things people do when they talk to each other without
a language. He was quite certain you were delivering
something in your briefcase.
(Pause.)

ANDERSON: Yes. All right. But it was not money.

MAN 6: Of course not. You are not a criminal.

ANDERSON: Quite so. I promised to bring Pavel one or two of

the Colloquium papers. He naturally has an interest in
philosophy and I assume it is not illegal.

MAN 6: Naturally not. Then you won’t mind showing me.

(ANDERSON hesitates then opens the briefcase and takes out
McKendrick’s paper and his own and passes them over.

MAN 6 takes them and reads their English titles.)
‘Ethical Fictions as Ethical Foundations’… ‘Philosophy and
the Catastrophe Theory’.
(MAN 6 gives the papers back to ANDERSON.)

MAN 6: You wish to go to the football match? You will see

twenty minutes, perhaps more.

ANDERSON: No. I’m going back to the university, to the

Colloquium.

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) Is he leaving?

MAN 6: Mrs Hollar would like you to remain.

ANDERSON: (To MRS HOLLAR) No, I’m sorry. (A thought strikes

him.) If you spoke to the taxi driver you would have known
perfectly well I was going to the England match.

(MAN 6 doesn’t reply to this either in word or expression.

ANDERSON closes his briefcase.
The doorbell rings and MAN 3 goes to open the door.
From the bedroom MAN 5 enters with a small parcel
wrapped in old newspaper.)

MAN 5: (In Czech) I found this, Chief, under the floorboards.

(MAN 5 gives the parcel to MAN 6, who unwraps it to reveal
a bundle of American dollars.

MRS HOLLAR watches this with disbelief and there is an
outburst.)

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) He’s lying! (To ANDERSON) It’s a lie –

The door reopens for MAN 3. SACHA HOLLAR, aged ten, comes
in with him. He is rather a tough little boy. He runs across
to his mother, who is crying and shouting, and embraces
her. It is rather as though he were a small adult comforting
her.)

ANDERSON: Oh my God … Mrs Hollar …

(ANDERSON, out of his depth and afraid, decides abruptly to
leave and does so. MAN 3 isn’t sure whether to let him go
but MAN 6 nods at him and ANDERSON leaves.)

7. INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. EVENING

ANDERSON approaches his room. He is worn out.
When he gets to his door and fumbles with his key he
realizes that he can hear a voice in the room next
door to his. He puts his ear to this other door.

GRAYSON: (Inside) Yes, a new top for the running piece – OK

Prague, Saturday.
(GRAYSON speaks not particularly slowly but with great
deliberation, enunciating every consonant and splitting
syllables up where necessary for clarity. He is, of course,
dictating to a fast typist.)
There’ll be Czechs bouncing in the streets of Prague
tonight as bankruptcy stares English football in the face,
stop, new par.
(ANDERSON knocks on the door.)
(Inside) It’s open!
(ANDERSON opens the door and looks into the room.
Interior room. It is of course a room very like Anderson’s

own room, if not identical. Its occupant, the man we had
seen leave the room earlier, is GRAYSON, a sports reporter
from England. He is on the telephone as ANDERSON
cautiously enters the room.) Make no mistake, comma, the
four-goal credit which these slick Slovaks netted here this
afternoon will keep them in the black through the second
leg of the World Cup Eliminator at Wembley next month,
stop. New par – (To ANDERSON) Yes? (Into phone) You can
bank on it.

ANDERSON: I’m next door.

GRAYSON: (Into phone) – bank on it. New par – (To ANDERSON)

Look, can you come back? (Into phone) But for some
determined saving by third-choice Jim Bart in the injury
hyphen jinxed England goal, we would have been
overdrawn by four more when the books were closed, stop.
Maybe Napoleon was wrong when he said we were a
nation of shopkeepers, stop. Today England looked like a
nation of goalkeepers, stop. Davey, Petherbridge and Shell
all made saves on the line. New par.

ANDERSON: Do you mind if I listen – I missed the match.

(GRAYSON waves him to a chair. ANDERSON sits on a chair
next to a door which is in fact a connecting door into the
next room. Not Anderson’s own room but the room on the
other side of Grayson’s room.)

standing by Wolker, with a W, and Deml, D dog, E Edward,
M mother, L London – who could go round the halls as a
telepathy act, stop. Only Crisp looked as if he had a future
outside Madame Tussaud’s – a.u.d.s. – stop. He laid on the
two best chances, comma, both wasted by Pratt, comma,
who ski’ed one and stubbed his toe on the other, stop.
Crisp’s, apostrophe s. comment from where I was sitting
looked salt and vinegar flavoured …
(ANDERSON has become aware that another voice is cutting
in from the next room. The door between the two rooms is
not quite closed. During Grayson’s last speech ANDERSON
gently pushes open the door and looks behind him and
realizes that a colleague of Grayson’s is also dictating in
the next room. 

ANDERSON stands up and looks into the next room and is

drawn into it by the rival report. 
This room belongs to CHAMBERLAIN. 
Interior CHAMBERLAIN’s room. CHAMBERLAIN on phone.)

CHAMBERLAIN: Wilson, who would like to be thought the big

bad man of the English defence, merely looked slow-footed
and slow-witted stop. Deml – D.E.M. mother L. – Deml got
round him five times on the trot, bracket, literally, close
bracket, using the same swerve, comma, making Wilson
look elephantine in everything but memory, stop. On the
fifth occasion there was nothing to prevent Deml scoring
except what Broadbent took it on himself to do, which was
to scythe Deml down from behind, stop. Halas scored from
the penalty, stop.
(ANDERSON sighs and sits down on the equivalent chair in
Chamberlain’s room. CHAMBERLAIN sees him.)
Can I help you –?

ANDERSON: Sorry – I’m from next door.

CHAMBERLAIN: (Into phone) New paragraph – (To ANDERSON) I

won’t be long – (Into phone) This goal emboldened the
Czechs to move Bartók, like the composer, forward and
risk the consequences, stop. Ten minutes later, just before
half-time, comma, he was the man left over to collect a
short corner from Halas and it was his chip which Jirasek
rose to meet for a simple goal at the far post –

ANDERSON: I knew it!

(CHAMBERLAIN turns to look at him.)

CHAMBERLAIN: (Into phone) New paragraph. As with tragic

opera, things got worse after the interval …
(ANDERSON has stood up to leave. He leaves through
Grayson’s room. GRAYSON is on the phone, saying:)

GRAYSON: (Into the phone) … Jirasek, unmarked at the far

post, flapped into the air like a great stork and, rising a
yard higher than Bart’s outstretched hands, he put
Czechoslovakia on the road to victory.
(ANDERSON leaves the room without looking at GRAYSON or
being noticed.)

8. INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM

The cut is to gay Czech music.

The dining room has a stage. A small group of Czech
musicians and singers in the tourist version of
peasant costume is performing. It is evening. At one
of 
the 
tables 
STONE, 
the 
American, 
and 
a

FRENCHMAN are sitting next to each other, and
sharing the table are 
ANDERSON, 
MCKENDRICK

and CHETWYN. The three of them are, for different
reasons, subdued, STONE is unsubdued. They are
reaching the end of the meal.

STONE: Hell’s bells. Don’t you understand English? When I say

to you, ‘Tell me what you mean’, you can only reply, ‘I
would wish to say so and so.’ ‘Never mind what you would
wish to say,’ I reply. ‘Tell me what you mean.’

FRENCHMAN: Mais oui, but if you ask me in French, you must

say, ‘Qu’est-ce que vous voulez dire?’ – ‘What is that which
you wish to say?’ Naturellement, it is in order for me to
reply, ‘Je veux dire etcetera.’

STONE: (Excitedly) But you are making my point – don’t you

see?

MCKENDRICK: What do you think the chances are of meeting a

free and easy woman in a place like this?

STONE: I can’t ask you in French.

MCKENDRICK: I don’t mean free, necessarily.

FRENCHMAN: Pourquoi non? Qu’est-ce que vous voulez dire?

Voilà! – now I have asked you.

CHETWYN: You don’t often see goose on an English menu.

(CHETWYN is the last to finish his main course. They have all
eaten the main course. There are drinks and cups of coffee
on the table.)

STONE: The French have no verb meaning ‘I mean’.

CHETWYN: Why’s that I wonder.

STONE: They just don’t.

CHETWYN: People are always eating goose in Dickens.

MCKENDRICK: Do you think it will be safe?

FRENCHMAN: Par exemple. Je vous dis, ‘Qu’est-ce que vous

voulez dire?’

MCKENDRICK: I mean, one wouldn’t want to be photographed

through a two-way mirror.

STONE: I don’t want to ask you what you would wish to say. I

want to ask you what you mean. Let’s assume there is a
difference.

rest of the goose?

STONE: Now assume that you say one but mean the other.

FRENCHMAN: Je dis quelque chose, mais je veux dire –

STONE: Right.

MCKENDRICK: (To STONE) Excuse me, Brad.

STONE: Yes?

MCKENDRICK: You eat well but you’re a lousy eater.

(This is a fair comment. STONE has spoken with his mouth
full of bread, cake, coffee, etc. and he is generally messy
about it. STONE smiles forgivingly but hardly pauses.)

STONE: Excuse us.

FRENCHMAN: A bientôt.

(STONE and the FRENCHMAN get up to leave.)

STONE: (Leaving) You see, what you’ve got is an incorrect

statement which when corrected looks like itself.
(There is a pause.)

MCKENDRICK: Did you have a chance to read my paper?

reading it carefully.

CHETWYN: I read it.

ANDERSON: Weren’t you there for it?

MCKENDRICK: No, he sloped off for the afternoon.

ANDERSON: Well, you sly devil, Chetwyn. I bet you had a

depressing afternoon. It makes the heart sick, doesn’t it.

CHETWYN: Yes, it does rather. We don’t know we’ve been boro.

MCKENDRICK: He wasn’t at the football match.

CHETWYN: Oh – is that where you were?

ANDERSON: No, I got distracted.

MCKENDRICK: He’s being mysterious. I think it’s a woman.

ANDERSON: (To CHETWYN) What were you doing?

CHETWYN: I was meeting some friends.

MCKENDRICK: He’s being mysterious. I don’t think it’s a

woman.

CHETWYN: I have friends here, that’s all.

ANDERSON: (To MCKENDRICK) Was your paper well received?

MCKENDRICK: No. They didn’t get it. I could tell from the

questions that there’d been some kind of communications

failure.

ANDERSON: The translation phones?

MCKENDRICK: No, no – they simply didn’t understand the line

of argument. Most of them had never heard of catastrophe
theory, so they weren’t ready for what is admittedly an
audacious application of it.

ANDERSON: I must admit I’m not absolutely clear about it.

MCKENDRICK: It’s like a reverse gear – no – it’s like a breaking

point. The mistake that people make is, they think a moral
principle is indefinitely extendible, that it holds good for
any situation, a straight line cutting across the graph of
our actual situation – here you are, you see – (He uses a
knife to score a line in front of him straight across the
table-cloth, left to right in front of him) ‘Morality’ down
there, running parallel to ‘Immorality’ up here (He scores
a parallel line) – and never the twain shall meet. They
think that is what a principle means.

ANDERSON: And isn’t it?

MCKENDRICK: No. The two lines are on the same plane. (He

holds out his flat hand, palm down, above the scored
lines.) They’re the edges of the same plane – it’s in three
dimensions, you see – and if you twist the plane in a
certain way, into what we call the catastrophe curve, you
get a model of the sort of behaviour we find in the real
world. There’s a point – the catastrophe point – where your
progress along one line of behaviour jumps you into the
opposite line; the principle reverses itself at the point
where a rational man would abandon it.

CHETWYN: Then it’s not a principle.

MCKENDRICK: There aren’t any principles in your sense. There

are only a lot of principled people trying to behave as if
there were.

ANDERSON: That’s the same thing, surely.

MCKENDRICK: You’re a worse case than Chetwyn and his

primitive Greeks. At least he has the excuse of believing in
goodness and beauty. You know they’re fictions but you’re
so hung up on them you want to treat them as if they were
God-given absolutes.

ANDERSON: I don’t see how else they would have any practical

value –

MCKENDRICK: So you end up using a moral principle as your

excuse for acting against a moral interest. It’s a sort of
funk –
(ANDERSON, under pressure, slams his cup back on to its
saucer in a very uncharacteristic and surprising way. His
anger is all the more alarming for that.)

ANDERSON: You make your points altogether too easily,
McKendrick. What need have you of moral courage when

your principles reverse themselves so conveniently?

MCKENDRICK: All right! I’ve gone too far. As usual. Sorry. Let’s

talk about something else. There’s quite an attractive
woman hanging about outside, loitering in the vestibule.
(The dining-room door offers a view of the lobby.)
Do you think it is a trap? My wife said to me – now, Bill,
don’t do anything daft, you know what you’re like, if a
blonde knocked on your door with the top three buttons of
her police uniform undone and asked for a cup of sugar
you’d convince yourself she was a bus conductress
brewing up in the next room.

ANDERSON: (Chastened) I’m sorry … you’re right up to a point.

There would be no moral dilemmas if moral principles
worked in straight lines and never crossed each other. One
meets test situations which have troubled much cleverer
men than us.

CHETWYN: A good rule, I find, is to try them out on men much

less clever than us. I often ask my son what he thinks.

ANDERSON: Your son?

CHETWYN: Yes. He’s eight.

MCKENDRICK: She’s definitely glancing this way – seriously, do

you think one could chat her up?
(STONE turns round to look through the door and we see
now that the woman is MRS HOLLAR.)

ANDERSON: Excuse me.

(He gets up and starts to leave, but then comes back
immediately and takes his brief case from under the table
and then leaves. We stay with the table. MCKENDRICK
watches ANDERSON meet MRS HOLLAR and shake her hand
and they disappear.)

MCKENDRICK: Bloody hell, it was a woman. Crafty old beggar.

9. EXT. STREET. NIGHT

ANDERSON and MRS HOLLAR walking.
A park. A park bench. SACHA HOLLAR sitting on the
bench.
ANDERSON and MRS HOLLAR arrive.

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) Here he is. (To ANDERSON) Sacha. (In

Czech) Thank him for coming.

SACHA: She is saying thank you that you come.

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) We’re sorry to bother him.

SACHA: She is saying sorry for the trouble.

ANDERSON: No, no I am sorry about … everything. Do you

learn English at school?

SACHA: Yes. I am learning English two years. With my father

also.

ANDERSON: You are very good.

SACHA: Not good. You are a friend of my father. Thank you.

ANDERSON: I’m afraid I’ve done nothing.

SACHA: You have his writing?

ANDERSON: His thesis? Yes. It’s in here. (He indicates his

briefcase.)

SACHA: (In Czech) It’s all right, he’s still got it.

(MRS HOLLAR nods.)

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) Tell him I didn’t know who he was

today.

SACHA: My mother is not knowing who you are, tomorrow at

the apartment.

ANDERSON: Today.

SACHA: Today. Pardon. So she is saying, ‘Come here! Come

here! Come inside the apartment!’ Because she is not
knowing. My father is not telling her. He is telling me only.

ANDERSON: I see. What did he tell you?

SACHA: He will go see his friend the English professor. He is

taking the writing.

ANDERSON: I see. Did he return home last night?

SACHA: No. He is arrested outside hotel. Then in the night

they come to make search.

ANDERSON: Had they been there all night?

SACHA: At eleven o’clock they are coming. They search twenty

hours.

ANDERSON: My God.

SACHA: In morning I go to Bartolomesskaya to be seeing him.

MRS HOLLAR: (Explains) Police.

SACHA: But I am not seeing him. They say go home. I am

waiting Then I am going home. Then I am seeing you.

ANDERSON: What were they looking for?

SACHA: (Shrugs) Western books. Also my father is writing

things. Letters, politics, philosophy. They find nothing.
Some English books they don’t like but really nothing. But
the dollars, of course, they pretend to find.
(MRS HOLLAR hears the word dollars.)

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) Tell him the dollars were put there by

the police.

SACHA: Not my father’s dollars. He is having no moneys.

ANDERSON: Yes. I know.

SACHA: They must arrest him for dollars because he does

nothing No bad things. He is signing something. So they
are making trouble.

ANDERSON: Yes.

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) Tell him about Jan.

SACHA: You must give back my father’s thesis. Not now. The

next days. My mother cannot take it.

ANDERSON: He asked me to take it to England.

SACHA: Not possible now. But thank you.

ANDERSON: He asked me to take it.

SACHA: Not possible. Now they search you, I think. At the

aeroport. Because they are seeing you coming to the
apartment and you have too much contact. Maybe they are
seeing us now.
(ANDERSON looks around him.)
Is possible.

ANDERSON: (Uncomfortably) I ought to tell you … (Quickly) I

came to the apartment to give the thesis back. I refused
him. But he was afraid he might be stopped – I thought he
just meant searched, not arrested –

SACHA: Too quick – too quick –

(Pause.)

ANDERSON: What do you want me to do?

SACHA: My father’s friend – he is coming to Philosophy

Congress today.

ANDERSON: Tomorrow.

SACHA: Yes tomorrow. You give him the writing. Is called Jan.

Is OK. Good friend.
(ANDERSON nods.)

ANDERSON: Jan.

SACHA: (In Czech) He’ll bring it to the university hall for Jan

tomorrow. (SACHA stands up.) We go home now.
(MRS HOLLAR gets up and shakes hands with ANDERSON.)

ANDERSON: I’m sorry … What will happen to him?

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech) What was that?

SACHA: (In Czech) He wants to know what will happen to

Daddy.

MRS HOLLAR: Ruzyne.

SACHA: That is the prison. Ruzyne.

(Pause.)

ANDERSON: I will, of course, try to help in England. I’ll write

letters. The Czech Ambassador … I have friends, too, in
our government –
(ANDERSON realizes that the boy has started to cry. He is
specially taken aback because he has been talking to him
like an adult.)
Now listen – I am personally friendly with important
people – the Minister of Education – people like that.

MRS HOLLAR: (In Czech but to ANDERSON) Please help Pavel –

ANDERSON: Mrs Hollar – I will do everything I can for him.

(He watches MRS HOLLAR and SACHA walk away into the
dark.)

10. INT. ANDERSON’S ROOM. NIGHT

ANDERSON is lying fully dressed on the bed. His eyes
open. Only light from the window. There are faint
voices from Grayson’s room. After a while ANDERSON
gets up and leaves his room and knocks on Grayson’s
door.
Exterior Grayson’s room.
GRAYSON opens his door.

GRAYSON: Oh hello. Sorry, are we making too much noise?

ANDERSON: No, it’s all right, but I heard you were still up and I

wondered if I could ask a favour of you. I wonder if I could
borrow your typewriter.

GRAYSON: My typewriter?

ANDERSON: Yes.

GRAYSON: Well, I’m leaving in the morning.

ANDERSON: I’ll let you have it back first thing. I’m leaving on

the afternoon plane myself.

GRAYSON: Oh–all right then.

ANDERSON: That’s most kind.

(During the above the voices from the room have been
semi-audible. 
McKendrick’s voice, rather drunk, but articulate, is
heard.)

MCKENDRICK: (His voice only, heard underneath the above

dialogue) Now, listen to me, I’m a professional philosopher.
You’ll do well to listen to what I have to say.

ANDERSON: That sounds as if you’ve got McKendrick in there.

GRAYSON: Oh – is he one of yours?

ANDERSON: I wouldn’t put it like that.

GRAYSON: He’s getting as tight as a tick.

ANDERSON: Yes.

GRAYSON: You couldn’t collect him, could you? He’s going to

get clouted in a minute.

ANDERSON: Go ahead and clout him, if you like.

GRAYSON: It’s not me. It’s Broadbent and a couple of the lads.

Your pal sort of latched on to us in the bar. He really ought
to be getting home.

ANDERSON: I’ll see what I can do.

(ANDERSON follows GRAYSON into the room.)

MCKENDRICK: How can you expect the kids to be little

gentlemen when their heroes behave like yobs – answer
me that – no – you haven’t answered my question – if
you’ve got yobs on the fields you’re going to have yobs on
the terraces.
(Interior Grayson’s room. 

MCKENDRICK is the only person standing up. He is holding
court, with a bottle of whisky in one hand and his glass in
the other. Around this small room are BROADBENT, CRISP,

CHAMBERLAIN and perhaps one or two members of the
England squad. Signs of a bottle party.)

GRAYSON: (Closing his door) I thought philosophers were

quiet, studious sort of people.

ANDERSON: Well, some of us are.

MCKENDRICK: (Shouts) Anderson! You’re the very man I want

to see! We’re having a philosophical discussion about the
yob ethics of professional footballers –

BROADBENT: You want to watch it, mate.

MCKENDRICK: Roy here is sensitive because he gave away a

penalty today, by a deliberate foul. To stop a certain goal
he hacked a chap down. After all, a penalty might be saved
and broken legs are quite rare –
(BROADBENT stands up but MCKENDRICK pacifies him with a
gesture.)
It’s perfectly all right – you were adopting the utilitarian
values of the game, for the good of the team, for England!
But I’m not talking about particular acts of expediency.
No, I’m talking about the whole ethos.

ANDERSON: McKendrick, don’t you think it’s about time we

retired?

MCKENDRICK: (Ignoring him) Now, I’ve played soccer for years.

Years and years. I played soccer from the age of eight until
I was thirteen. At which point I went to a rugger school.
Even so, Tommy here will tell you that I still consider
myself something of a left-winger. (This is to CRISP.) Sorry
about that business in the lift, by the way, Tommy. Well,
one thing I remember clearly from my years and years of
soccer is that if two players go for a ball which then goes
into touch, there’s never any doubt among those players
which of them touched the ball last. I can’t remember one
occasion in all those years and years when the player who
touched the ball last didn’t realize it. So, what I want to
know is – why is it that on ‘Match of the Day’, every time
the bloody ball goes into touch, both players claim the
throw-in for their own side? I merely ask for information.
Is it because they are very, very stupid or is it because a
dishonest advantage is as welcome as an honest one?

CHAMBERLAIN: Well, look, it’s been a long evening, old chap –

ANDERSON: Tomorrow is another day, McKendrick.

MCKENDRICK: Tomorrow, in my experience, is usually the same

day. Have a drink –

ANDERSON: No thank you.

MCKENDRICK: Here’s a question for anthropologists. Name me

a tribe which organizes itself into teams for sporting
encounters and greets every score against their opponents
with paroxysms of childish glee, whooping, dancing and
embracing in an ecstasy of crowing self-congratulation in
the very midst of their disconsolate fellows? – Who are
these primitives who pile all their responses into the
immediate sensation, unaware or uncaring of the long
undulations of life’s fortunes? Yes, you’ve got it! (He
chants the ‘Match of the Day’ signature tune.) It’s the yob-
of-the-month competition, entries on a postcard please.
But the question is – is it because they’re working class, or
is it because financial greed has corrupted them? Or is it
both?

ANDERSON: McKendrick, you are being offensive.

MCKENDRICK: Anderson is one of life’s cricketers. Clap, clap.

(He claps in a well-bred sort of way and puts on a well-
bred voice.) Well played, sir. Bad luck, old chap. The
comparison with cricket may suggest to you that yob
ethics are working class.
(BROADBENT comes up to MCKENDRICK and pushes him
against the wall. MCKENDRICK is completely unconcerned,
escapes and continues without pause.) 
But you would be quite wrong. Let me refer you to a
typical 
rugby 
team 
of 
Welsh 
miners. 
A 
score 
is

acknowledged with pride but with restraint, the scorer
himself composing his features into an expressionless
mask lest he might be suspected of exulting in his
opponents’ misfortune – my God, it does the heart good,
doesn’t it? I conclude that yob ethics are caused by
financial greed.

ANDERSON: Don’t be such an ass.

(MCKENDRICK takes this as an intellectual objection.)

MCKENDRICK: You think it’s the adulation, perhaps? (To CRISP)

Is it the adulation, Tommy, which has corrupted you?

CRISP: What’s he flaming on about?

CHAMBERLAIN: Well, I think it’s time for my shut-eye.

CRISP: No, I want to know what he’s saying about me. He’s

giving me the needle.

ANDERSON: (To MCKENDRICK) May I remind you that you profess

to be something of a pragmatist yourself in matters of
ethics –

MCKENDRICK: Ah yes – I –see – you think that because I don’t

believe in reliable signposts on the yellow brick road to
rainbowland, you think I’m a bit of a yob myself – the swift
kick in the kneecap on the way up the academic ladder –
the Roy Broadbent of Stoke – (To BROADBENT) Stoke’s my
team, you know.

BROADBENT: Will you tell this stupid bugger his philosophy is

getting up my nostrils.

GRAYSON: You’re not making much sense, old boy.

MCKENDRICK: Ah! Grayson here has a fine logical mind. He has

put his finger on the flaw in my argument, namely that the
reason footballers are yobs may be nothing to do with
being working class, or with financial greed, or with
adulation, or even with being footballers. It may be simply
that football attracts a certain kind of person, namely yobs
–
(This is as far as he gets when BROADBENT smashes him in
the face. MCKENDRICK drops.)

CRISP: Good on you, Roy.

(ANDERSON goes to MCKENDRICK, who is flat on the floor.)

ANDERSON: McKendrick …

CHAMBERLAIN: Well, I’m going to bed.

(CHAMBERLAIN goes through the connecting door into his
own room and closes the door.)

BROADBENT: He can’t say that sort of thing and get away with

it.

GRAYSON: Where’s his room?

ANDERSON: On the third floor.

GRAYSON: Bloody hell.

CRISP: He’s waking up.

BROADBENT: He’s all right.

ANDERSON: Come on, McKendrick.

(They all lift MCKENDRICK to his feet. MCKENDRICK makes no
protest. He’s just about able to walk.)
I’ll take him down in the lift. (He sees the typewriter in its
case and says to GRAYSON) I’ll come back for the typewriter.
(He leads MCKENDRICK towards the door.)

MCKENDRICK: (Mutters) All right. I went too far. Let’s talk

about something else.
(But MCKENDRICK keeps walking or staggering. ANDERSON
opens GRAYSON’s door.)

BROADBENT: Here. That bloody Jirasek. Just like you said.

ANDERSON: Yes.

BROADBENT: They don’t teach you nothing at that place, then?

ANDERSON: No.

(ANDERSON helps MCKENDRICK out and closes the door.)

11. INT. THE COLLOQUIUM

ANDERSON comes to the lectern. There is a Czech
chairman behind him.
CHETWYN is in the audience but MCKENDRICK is not.
We arrive as ANDERSON approaches the microphone.
ANDERSON lays a sheaf of typewritten paper on the
lectern.

ANDERSON: I propose in this paper to take up a problem which

many have taken up before me, namely the conflict
between the rights of individuals and the rights of the
community. I will be making a distinction between rights
and rules.
(We note that the CHAIRMAN, listening politely and intently,
is suddenly puzzled. He himself has same papers and from
these he extracts one, which is in fact the official copy of
Anderson’s official paper. He starts looking at it. It doesn’t
take him long to satisfy himself that ANDERSON is giving a
different paper. These things happen while ANDERSON
speaks. At the same time the three INTERPRETERS in their
booths, while speaking into their microphones as ANDERSON
speaks, are also in some difficulty because they have
copies of Anderson’s official paper.) I will seek to show
that rules, in so far as they are related to rights, are a
secondary and consequential elaboration of primary
rights, and I will be associating rules generally with
communities and rights generally with individuals. I will
seek to show that a conflict between the two is generally a
pseudo-conflict arising out of one side or the other
pressing a pseudo-right. Although claiming priority for

rights over rules – where they are in conflict – I will be
defining rights as fictions acting as incentives to the
adoption of practical values; and I will further propose
that although these rights are fictions, there is an
obligation to treat them as if they were truths; and further,
that although this obligation can be shown to be based on
values which are based on fictions, there is an obligation
to treat that obligation as though it were based on truth;
and so on ad infinitum.
(At this point the CHAIRMAN interrupts him.)

CHAIRMAN: Pardon me – Professor – this is not your paper –

ANDERSON: In what sense? I am indisputably giving it.

CHAIRMAN: But it is not the paper you were invited to give.

ANDERSON: I wasn’t invited to give a particular paper.

CHAIRMAN: You offered one.

ANDERSON: That’s true.

CHAIRMAN: But this is not it.

ANDERSON: No. I changed my mind.

CHAIRMAN: But it is irregular.

ANDERSON: I didn’t realize it mattered.

CHAIRMAN: It is a discourtesy.

ANDERSON: (Taken aback) Bad manners? I am sorry.

CHAIRMAN: You cannot give this paper. We do not have copies.

ANDERSON: Do you mean that philosophical papers require

some sort of clearance?

CHAIRMAN: The interpreters cannot work without copies.

ANDERSON: Don’t worry. It is not a technical paper. I will speak

a little slower if you like. (ANDERSON turns back to the
microphone.) If we decline to define rights as fictions,
albeit with the force of truths, there are only two senses in
which humans could be said to have rights. Firstly, humans
might be said to have certain rights if they had collectively
and mutually agreed to give each other these rights. This
would merely mean that humanity is a rather large club
with club rules, but it is not what is generally meant by
human rights. It is not what Locke meant, and it is not
what the American Founding Fathers meant when, taking
the hint from Locke, they held certain rights to be
inalienable – among them, life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness. The early Americans claimed these as the

endowment of God – which is the second sense in which
humans might be said to have rights. This is a view more
encouraged in some communities than in others. I do not
wish to dwell on it here except to say that it is a view and
not a deduction, and that I do not hold it myself. What
strikes us is the consensus about an individual’s right put
forward both by those who invoke God’s authority and by
those who invoke no authority at all other than their own
idea of what is fair and sensible. The first Article of the
American Constitution, guaranteeing freedom of religious
observance, of expression, of the press, and of assembly, is
closely echoed by Articles 28 and 32 of the no less
admirable Constitution of Czechoslovakia, our generous
hosts on this occasion. Likewise, protection from invasion
of 
privacy, 
from 
unreasonable 
search 
and 
from

interference with letters and correspondence guaranteed
to the American people by Article 4 is likewise guaranteed
to the Czech people by Article 31.
(The 
CHAIRMAN, 
who 
has 
been 
more 
and 
more

uncomfortable, leaves the stage at this point. He goes into
the ‘wings’. At some distance from ANDERSON, but still just
in earshot of ANDERSON, i.e. one can hear Anderson’s words
clearly if faintly, is a telephone. Perhaps in a stage
manager’s office. We go with the CHAIRMAN but we can still
hear ANDERSON.)
Is such a consensus remarkable? Not at all. If there is a
God, we his creations would doubtless subscribe to his
values. And if there is not a God, he, our creation, would
undoubtedly be credited with values which we think to be
fair and sensible. But what is fairness? What is sense?
What are these values which we take to be self-evident?
And why are they values?

12. INT. MCKENDRICK’S ROOM

MCKENDRICK is fully dressed and coming round from
a severe hangover. His room is untidier than
Anderson’s. Clothes are strewn about. His suitcase,
half full, is open. His briefcase is also in evidence.
MCKENDRICK looks at his watch, but it has stopped.

He goes to the telephone and dials.

13. INT. ANDERSON’S ROOM

The phone starts to ring. The camera pulls back from
the phone and we see that there are two men in the
room, plain-clothes POLICEMEN, searching the room.
They look at the phone but only for a moment, and
while it rings they continue quietly. They search the
room very discreetly. We see one carefully slide open
a drawer and we cut away.

14. THE COLLOQUIUM

We have returned to Anderson’s paper. There is no
CHAIRMAN on stage.

ANDERSON: Ethics were once regarded as a sort of monument,

a ghostly Eiffel Tower constructed of Platonic entities like
honesty, loyalty, fairness, and so on, all bolted together and
consistent with each other, harmoniously stressed so as to
keep the edifice standing up: an ideal against which we
measured our behaviour. The tower has long been
demolished. In our own time linguistic philosophy
proposes that the notion of, say, justice has no existence
outside the ways in which we choose to employ the word,
and indeed consists only of the way in which we employ it.
In other words, that ethics are not the inspiration of our
behaviour but merely the creation of our utterances.
(Over the latter part of this we have gone back to the

CHAIRMAN who is on the telephone. The CHAIRMAN is doing
little talking and some listening.)
And yet common observation shows us that this view
demands qualification. A small child who cries ‘that’s not
fair’ when punished for something done by his brother or
sister is apparently appealing to an idea of justice which
is, for want of a better word, natural. And we must see
that natural justice, however illusory, does inspire many
people’s behaviour much of the time. As an ethical
utterance it seems to be an attempt to define a sense of

rightness which is not simply derived from some other
utterance elsewhere.
(We cut now to a backstage area, but ANDERSON’s voice is
continuous, heard through the sort of PA system which one
finds backstage at theatres.
The CHAIRMAN hurries along the corridor, seeking and now
finding a uniformed ‘FIREMAN’, a backstage official. During
this ANDERSON speaks.)
Now a philosopher exploring the difficult terrain of right
and wrong should not be over-impressed by the argument
‘a child would know the difference’. But when, let us say,
we are being persuaded that it is ethical to put someone in
prison for reading or writing the wrong books, it is well to
be reminded that you can persuade a man to believe
almost anything provided he is clever enough, but it is
much more difficult to persuade someone less clever.
There is a sense of right and wrong which precedes
utterance. It is individually experienced and it concerns
one person’s dealings with another person. From this
experience we have built a system of ethics which is the
sum of individual acts of recognition of individual right.
(During this we have returned to ANDERSON in person. And
at this point the CHAIRMAN re-enters the stage and goes and
sits in his chair. ANDERSON continues, ignoring him.)
If this is so, the implications are serious for a collective or
state ethic which finds itself in conflict with individual
rights, and seeks, in the name of the people, to impose its
values on the very individuals who comprise the state. The
illogic of this manoeuvre is an embarrassment to
totalitarian systems. An attempt is sometimes made to
answer it by consigning the whole argument to ‘bourgeois
logic’, which is a concept no easier to grasp than
bourgeois physics or bourgeois astronomy. No, the fallacy
must lie elsewhere –
(At this point loud bells, electric bells, ring. The fire alarm.
The CHAIRMAN leaps up and shouts.)

CHAIRMAN: (In Czech) Don’t panic! There appears to be a fire

Please leave the hall in an orderly manner. (In English)
Fire! Please leave quietly!
(The philosophers get to their feet and start heading for

the exit. ANDERSON calmly gathers his papers up and leaves
the stage.)

15. INT. AIRPORT

People leaving the country have to go through a
baggage check. There are at least three separate but
adjacent benches at which CUSTOMS MEN and
WOMEN search the baggage of travellers. The
situation here is as follows:
At the first bench CHETWYN is in mid-search.
At the second bench ANDERSON is in mid-search.
At the third bench a traveller is in mid-search.
There is a short queue of people waiting for each
bench. The leading man in the queue waiting for the
third bench is MCKENDRICK. The search at this third
bench is cursory.
However, 
ANDERSON 
is 
being 
searched 
very

thoroughly. We begin on ANDERSON. We have not yet
noted CHETWYN.
At Anderson’s bench a uniformed CUSTOMS WOMAN
is examining the contents of his suitcase, helped by a
uniformed CUSTOMS MAN. At the same time a plain-
clothes 
POLICEMAN is very carefully searching

everything in Anderson’s briefcase.
We see the CUSTOMS MAN take a cellophane-wrapped
box of chocolates from Anderson’s case. He strips off
the cellophane and looks at the chocolates and then
he digs down to look at the second layer of
chocolates. ANDERSON watches this with amazement.
The chocolate box is closed and put back in the case.
Meanwhile, a nest of wooden dolls, the kind in which
one doll fits inside another, is reduced to its
components.
The camera moves to find MCKENDRICK arriving at
the third desk. There is no plain-clothes POLICEMAN

there. The CUSTOMS OFFICER there opens his
briefcase and flips, in a rather cursory way, through
McKendrick’s papers. He asks MCKENDRICK to open
his 
case. 
He 
digs 
about 
for 
a 
moment 
in

McKendrick’s case.
Back 
at 
Anderson’s 
bench 
the 
plain-clothes

POLICEMAN 
is 
taking 
Anderson’s 
wallet 
from

ANDERSON’s hand. He goes through every piece of
paper in the wallet.
We 
go 
back 
to 
McKendrick’s 
bench 
to 
find

MCKENDRICK closing his case and being moved on.
MCKENDRICK turns round to ANDERSON to speak.

MCKENDRICK: You picked the wrong queue, old man. Russian

roulette. And Chetwyn.
(We now discover CHETWYN, who is going through a similar
search to Anderson’s. He has a plain-clothes POLICEMAN too.
This POLICEMAN is looking down the spine of a book from
Chetwyn’s suitcase. We now return to Anderson’s bench.
We find that the CUSTOMS MAN has discovered a suspicious
bulge in the zipped compartment on the underside of the
lid of Anderson’s suitcase. ANDERSON’s face tells us that he
has a spasm of anxiety. The bulge suggests something
about the size of Hollar’s envelope. The CUSTOMS MAN zips
open 
the 
compartment 
and 
extracts 
the 
copy 
of

McKendrick’s girlie magazine. ANDERSON is embarrassed.
We return to CHETWYN, whose briefcase is being searched
paper by paper. The CUSTOMS OFFICIAL searching his
suitcase finds a laundered shirt, nicely ironed and folded.
He opens the shirt up and discovers about half a dozen
sheets of writing-paper. Thin paper with typewriting on it.
Also a photograph of a man. The plain-clothes POLICEMAN
joins the CUSTOMS OFFICIAL and he starts looking at these
pieces of paper. He looks up at CHETWYN, whose face has
gone white.)

16. INT. AEROPLANE

The plane is taxiing.

MCKENDRICK and ANDERSON are sitting together.
MCKENDRICK looks shocked.

ANDERSON: Silly bugger. Honestly.

ANDERSON: It’s all right – they’ll put him on the next plane.

MCKENDRICK: To Siberia.

ANDERSON: No, no, don’t be ridiculous. It wouldn’t look well

for them, would it? All the publicity. I don’t think there’s
anything in Czech law about being in possession of letters
to Amnesty International and the UN and that sort of thing
They couldn’t treat Chetwyn as though he were a Czech
national anyway.

MCKENDRICK: Very unpleasant for him though.

ANDERSON: Yes.

MCKENDRICK: He took a big risk.

ANDERSON: Yes.

MCKENDRICK: I wouldn’t do it. Would you?

ANDERSON: No. He should have known he’d be searched.

MCKENDRICK: Why did they search you?

ANDERSON: They thought I might have something.

MCKENDRICK: Did you have anything?

ANDERSON: I did in a way.

MCKENDRICK: What was it?

ANDERSON: A thesis. Apparently rather slanderous from the

state’s point of view.

MCKENDRICK: Where did you hide it?

ANDERSON: In your briefcase.

(Pause.)

MCKENDRICK: You what?

ANDERSON: Last night. I’m afraid I reversed a principle.

(MCKENDRICK opens his briefcase and finds Hollar’s
envelope,  ANDERSON takes it from him. MCKENDRICK is
furious.)

MCKENDRICK: You utter bastard.

ANDERSON: I thought you would approve.

MCKENDRICK: Don’t get clever with me. (He relapses, shaking.)

Jesus. It’s not quite playing the game is it? ANDERSON: No, I
suppose not. But they were very unlikely to

search you.

MCKENDRICK: That’s not the bloody point.

ANDERSON: I thought it was. But you could be right. Ethics is a

very complicated business. That’s why they have these
congresses.
(The plane picks up speed on the runway towards take-
off.)

The First Secretary

1. EXT. SEA SHORE. SUMMER DAY

Empty beach. Sea. Sky.
With the mention of his name we find EDWARD
GIEREK, a middle-aged man in a suit, overcoat, hat
and lace-up shoes, walking along by the sea.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Towards the end of July 1980 Edward

Gierek, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers’ Party,
which is to say the boss of Communist Poland, left Warsaw
for his annual holiday in the Soviet Union by the Black Sea
There he met …
(BREZHNEV, similarly dressed, is walking towards GIEREK.) …
Leonid Brezhnev, First Secretary of the Communist Party
of the USSR.
(The two men meet and grasp each other’s shoulders and
kiss each other on both cheeks.)
In an atmosphere of cordiality and complete mutual
understanding the two leaders had a frank exchange of
views.

BREZHNEV: Comrade! As your friends and allies in the

progress towards the inevitable triumph of Marxist-
Leninism, we are concerned, deeply concerned, by recent
departures from Leninist norms by Polish workers
manipulated by a revisionist element of the Polish
intelligentsia!

GIEREK: Comrade First Secretary! As your friends and allies in

the proletariat’s struggle against international capitalism
… 
(GIEREK evidently continues in the same vein.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) That isn’t them, of course –

(Close up on the NARRATOR, in the same location.)
(To camera) – and this isn’t the Black Sea. Everything is
true except the words and the pictures. If there was a
beach, Brezhnev and Gierek probably didn’t talk on it, and

if they did, they probably wouldn’t have been wearing, on
a beach in July, those hats and coats and lace-up shoes
which you get for being a Communist leader. They were
after all …

2. EXT. SEASIDE. SUMMER DAY

NARRATOR: (Voice over) … supposed to be on holiday.

(There are gay umbrellas and cool, brightly coloured
drinks to hand. Everything in fact is highly coloured.

BREZHNEV and GIEREK are now wearing brightly coloured
Hawaiian shirts and slacks. They wear sunglasses. They
drink from pink drinks with little purple paper umbrellas
sticking out of them. BREZHNEV, however, is attended by
two or three AIDES, who are dressed in dark suits. The one
who is going to speak wears a suit and is carrying a file of
papers ostentatiously marked ‘Poland’.)
And even if you got the look of it right, they probably
didn’t talk like a Pravda editorial, because if you’re the
boss of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and if
you’ve got twenty armoured divisions in East Germany and
your supply lines have to go across Poland and the Polish
railway workers are on strike, you don’t say that you are
deeply concerned about departures from Leninist norms,
you probably say …

BREZHNEV: (Shouting like a gangster) What the hell is going

on with you guys? Who’s running the country? You or the
engine drivers? Your workforce has got you by the short
hairs because you’re up to your neck in hock to German
bankers, American bankers, Swiss bankers – you’re in
hock to us to the tune of … (Glances at the AIDE for aid) …
is it millions or billions …?
(The AIDE panics for a second, shuffling and dropping his
papers, but rises to the occasion.)

AIDE: Zillions.

BREZHNEV: (Triumphantly shouts) Zillions of roubles!

AIDE: Zlotys.

BREZHNEV: (Rounding on him) You shut up!

3. EXT. SEASIDE. SUMMER DAY

NARRATOR: (To camera) Who knows?  

All the same, there was something going on which remains
true even when the words and the pictures are mostly
made up. Between August 1980 and December 1981 an
attempt was made in Poland to put together two ideas
which wouldn’t fit, the idea of freedom as it is understood
in the West, and the idea of socialism as it is understood in
the Soviet empire. The attempt failed because it was
impossible, in the same sense as it is impossible in
geometry to turn a circle into a square with  the same area
– not because no one has found out how to do it, but
because there is no way in which it can be done. What
happened in Poland was that a number of people tried for
sixteen months to change the shape of the system without
changing the area covered by the original shape. They
failed.

4. EXT. AIRFIELD. NIGHT

So EDWARD GIEREK is met by Prime Minister
BABIUCH. They grasp each other’s shoulders and kiss
each other on the cheek.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Edward Gierek came home from the

Black Sea on August 15th.

BABIUCH: Welcome home, Comrade. I’m sorry you had to cut

short your holiday.
(But GIEREK is immediately concerned with part of his
holiday luggage, which is being taken off the plane by a
uniformed MINION. The item is a large beach bag, out of
which protrudes a snorkel and a ridiculous straw hat. The

MINION jostles the bag, which clinks dangerously.)

GIFREK: Careful with that …

(GIEREK takes the bag from the MINION. GIEREK and BABIUCH
wait for the car which is to take them away.)

BABIUCH: Comrade Kania has been to Gdansk.

GIEREK: Why?

BABIUCH: Why? Because the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk is at a

complete 
standstill. 
The 
Party 
Secretary 
up 
there

telephoned yesterday in a panic.

GIEREK: I know all that. Do we have to have a member of the

Politburo rushing to the scene whenever there’s a
disruption of working norms?

BABIUCH: You sent Jagielski to settle the railway strike.

GIEREK: The railway disruption of working norms was

different.

BABIUCH: Kania says this one is different.

GIEREK: How much are they asking for?

BABIUCH: Two thousand a month, but it’s not the money that

worries us.

GIEREK: It should. It’s the money we haven’t got.

(Car pulls in front. The car door is being held open for
them.)

BABIUCH: After you, Comrade First Secretary.

GIEREK: Thank you, Comrade Prime Minister.

(BABIUCH takes Gierek’s bag for him.)

BABIUCH: Allow me …

(GIEREK gets into the car followed by BABIUCH and the beach
bag.)

5. INT. THE CAR. NIGHT

GIEREK and BABIUCH in the back seat. GIEREK takes
the bag from
BABIUCH and searches about in it during the
narration.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The Prime Minister is, of course, the

head of the government. Today, and for several days to
come, his name is Mr Babiuch. Apart from having a prime
minister, Poland has elections, a parliament and a head of
state, much like Britain or France or America.
(GIEREK finds what he has been looking for in the bag –
which he hands to BABIUCH, who is suitably grateful.)

GIEREK: I’ve brought you some caviar.

6. EXT. PARTY HEADQUARTERS. NIGHT

The car draws up. GIEREK and BABIUCH get out of the
car and enter the building. The door is opened by a
doorman. This person is going to pop up again in

various guises throughout the film, so for simplicity’s
sake he will henceforth be referred to as the
WITNESS.
The NARRATOR enters the frame.

NARRATOR: (To camera) This is where it all gets different from

bourgeois Western democracy. In the East, they have the
window-dressing but the shop is run by the Party. Through
nominees and controlled elections the Party dominates
parliament and manages the machinery of the state, and
thus is in a position to fulfil its sacred trust of defending
the interests of the working people …

7. INT. PARTY HEADQUARTERS. NIGHT

BABIUCH is carrying Gierek’s bag. GIEREK sees KANIA
coming up behind and pauses to fish about in the
bag, so that he is able to greet KANIA with another
jar of caviar.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) … with caviar and limousines.

8. EXT. PARTY HEADQUARTERS. NIGHT

The NARRATOR has just finished addressing the
camera and is interrupted by the WITNESS.

WITNESS: A cheap shot, in my opinion. These people are not

doormen. These are people with big responsibilities.

NARRATOR: Just making an observation.

WITNESS: It’s not a factor. I never saw the President of France

arrive anywhere on a bicycle eating a salami sandwich.

NARRATOR: Excuse me.

(To camera) It works like this. The Party Congress, about
2,000 delegates who meet every five years, not counting
emergencies, elects a Central Committee of about 200
members who meet as and when to supervise Party policy.
To implement that policy the Central Committee elects …

9. INT. POLITBURO MEETING. NIGHT

NARRATOR: (Voice over) … the Political Bureau.

(There are about a dozen members of the Politburo, now
seen placing themselves at a large table. They include

GIEREK, 
BABIUCH, 
KANIA, 
SZYDLAK, 
JARUZELSKI, 
BARCIKOWSKI,

JAGIELSKI and FINANSKY. [‘FINANSKY’ is an invented name to
allow two different finance ministers to be represented in
one character.]
This is not a meeting of the Government. This is the
Politburo.
(GIEREK is the chairman. He invites KANIA to begin.)

GIEREK: Comrade Kania …?

KANIA: At Gdansk in the Lenin shipyard they demand …

number one, a wage increase of 2,000 zlotys a month.
Number two, reinstatement of sacked troublemakers.
Number three, family allowances increased to the same
level enjoyed by police and security forces. Number four,
earlier retirement. Number five, a monument outside the
main gate …

GIEREK: A monument?

KANIA: Yes. To the dead of 1970. The strike spokesman is

obsessed with putting up a monument. He was in the
shipyard in Gdansk in 1970. He’s been arrested more than
once for holding demonstrations outside the gate on the
anniversary … Actually, he’s been arrested about a
hundred times for one thing or another. The shipyard
director tried to settle for a plaque in the dining hall but
he insists on a monument, forty metres high.

GIEREK: Is he mad?

SZYDLAK: That’s an idea …

KANIA: (To SZYDLAK) No.

GIEREK: Who is he?

KANIA: Walesa. You’ve met him.

GIEREK: When?

KANIA: Ten years ago. After the 1970 riots. You went to talk to

the workers in the Baltic ports –

GIEREK: Yes.

KANIA: In Gdansk there was a three-man delegation. Walesa

was one of them. Moustache. He didn’t speak. You
remember him?

GIEREK: No.

KANIA: Well, I think they’d settle for the money and the

reinstatements. Enough of them would, anyway.
(GIEREK looks towards FINANSKY.)

to spend it on. The situation is inflationary, and would be
more so if we did not keep food cheap artificially. The
farmer buys bread to feed the pigs because it is cheaper
than the wheat he sells to us. Then we buy the pigs for 130
zlotys per kilo and we sell the butcher’s pork for 70 zlotys.
Such subsidies are costing us 3 billion zlotys a year. As a
matter of fact the same money would pay our interest to
Western bankers this year.

GIEREK: (To KANIA) We cannot give way on the money. It buys

nothing.

KANIA: It buys time.

GIEREK: Are you an economist?

KANIA: I have been to Gdansk.

demand the same. Then Szczecin. It’ll spread everywhere.

KANIA: So will the strike if we don’t stop it.

SZYDLAK: Send in the police, the state security …

KANIA: There’s no public disorder.

SZYDLAK: A strike is a public disorder. In fact it’s illegal. If the

police can’t handle it send in the army.
(The members turn generally towards JARUZELSKI, who is in
general’s uniform.)

JARUZELSKI: To do what? I said in 1970 that I wouldn’t order

Polish soldiers to shoot Polish workers.

SZYDLAK: But they did shoot. The army and the police. And the

strikers went back to work.

JARUZELSKI: Not all of them.

SZYDLAK: All of them.

JARUZELSKI: Not the ones who were dead.

repeat December 1970. And if you remember, the men in
the shipyards did not go back to work until I went to talk
to them. January ’71. The bloodstains were still on the
street. I had been First Secretary for one month. The
pickets at the gate didn’t recognize me. I had to tell them
who I was. It’s not so surprising. When did the Party
leader ever come to debate with the workers face to face

on their own ground? And we talked. I told them how I had
worked in the mines in Belgium and France. With these
hands. I said to them, help us, help me, I’m a worker too.
We can start again. I told them there was going to be a
new spirit. A new Poland. A rich Poland. But the poison got
back into the system.
(Helplessly) What does one do …?

KANIA: We’ve cut the phone lines from Gdansk.

GIEREK: No – it’s time to be frank. We have to tell the country

what’s going on.

JARUZELSKI: Everybody listens to the foreign radio stations –

they know what’s going on.

GIEREK: If they know, we can afford to be frank. We must

explain the shortages … the danger of inflation … we must
appeal to patriotism and common sense.

BABIUCH: (Dubiously) Do you really think …?

GIEREK: We must, of course, accept some of the blame On the

radio and television, tonight.

BABIUCH: Will you do it?

GIEREK: Me? No, you’re the Prime Minister.

10. THE SAME. HIGHT

In other words, the Politburo meeting continues into
the night, now without BABIUCH … who is, however,
present and talking, on a television set which the
rest of the Politburo are watching. The formality of
the meeting has disintegrated. Ties are loosened,
cups and glasses are littered about. The cut is to
BABIUCH on the television but his speech is mostly
audible wallpaper for the camera’s travel.

BABIUCH: It has to be admitted that in the past we have not

always 
managed 
to 
deal 
efficiently 
with 
economic

difficulties. The public has not been given sufficient
information about our troubles, about the state of the
economy and the growing problems as and when they
occurred. We have not prepared ourselves sufficiently for
the difficult times which we should have seen as
inevitable. Even today, not everyone realizes what our

country’s economic situation is like. To put it bluntly, our
country’s indebtedness has reached a point which must
not on any account be overstepped. We have been living
and developing on credit. Stopping work not only harms
the national economy, it also turns against the working
class and working people in general, damaging their vital
interests. The opponents of People’s Poland are trying to
use the atmosphere of tension and emotion for their own
political ends, putting forward slogans and suggestions
which have nothing in common with the aspirations of the
working class.
(During this:)

KANIA: (To GIEREK) What do we do if it doesn’t work?

GIEREK: We could try another prime minister.

KANIA: Seriously, we’ll have to make them an offer.

GIEREK: How much?

KANIA: 
Fifteen 
hundred, 
and 
the 
reinstatement 
of

troublemakers, and the monument.

GIEREK: Will they settle?

KANIA: Yes.

except in an emergency. (Points at 
BABIUCH on the

television.) This is for Comrade Brezhnev.

BABIUCH: (On television) The world is watching us, wondering

how we can manage in these difficult moments …

11. INT. CAFE. NIGHT

A café in Poland. There is a television set. BABIUCH is
continuing to speak.

BABIUCH: (On television) We have reliable allies who also

worry about our troubles and believe that we will be able
to overcome them ourselves. They wish us success from
the bottom of their hearts.
(Among the people in the café are the NARRATOR and the

WITNESS.)

NARRATOR: (To camera) Poland’s reliable ally, her neighbour to

the east, had been a watchful and threatening presence
since 1945.

WITNESS: 1700.

(The NARRATOR is about to protest.)
All right, 1720 but no later. You won’t understand Poland’s
attitude to Russia until you understand some Polish
history. This won’t take long.

NARRATOR: I hope not.

(The WITNESS reaches over to an adjacent table for a basket
of bread rolls, which he tips over on to his own table. He
pushes the bread rolls together in the middle of the table.)

WITNESS: Nobody except the Poles remembers that for 300

years this was the biggest and freest country in Middle
Europe, spanning the continent from the Baltic almost to
the Black Sea and reaching hundreds of miles east into
modern Russia. Russia’s greatness came after Poland’s
and was achieved at Poland’s expense. During the
eighteenth 
century, 
Poland 
came 
under 
Russian

domination. This alarmed the other great powers, Austria
and Prussia, so in 1772 Catherine the Great gave a bit of
Poland to each of them to keep them quiet.
(He detaches a couple of bread rolls, pushing them ‘west’,
and a couple more ‘south’.)
This was the first of three partitions which were to
dismember the country by the end of the century. By the
standards of the time Poland had a liberal tradition,
squeezed now between three emperors. In 1793 Russia
and Prussia decided to cut Poland down to size.
(He separates two bread rolls to the ‘east’ and two more to
the ‘west’. This leaves half a dozen bread rolls in the
middle of the table.)
Poland, what was left of it, rebelled and in 1795 the three
power blocks finished the job.
(He pushes two rolls to the ‘west’. two to the ‘east’ and
two to the ‘south’. There is none left in the middle.)
Poland disappeared. Of course there were still an awful lot
of Poles around, and when Napoleon turned up to
challenge the great powers large numbers of them joined
his armies. The reward was the Duchy of Warsaw, 1807.
(He places a single bread roll in the middle of the table.)
It lasted as long as Napoleon lasted. And when the victors
met in Vienna to carve up the map, Russia got the prize.
(He pushes the bread roll to the ‘east’.)

For a hundred years after that Poland was mainly an idea
kept alive by an underground at home and émigrés
abroad. The period of romantic exile.

NARRATOR: Oh yes, handsome young men in lace cuffs playing

the piano in Paris … I wondered.

WITNESS: They were waiting for a miracle. The miracle

happened in 1918, with the simultaneous collapse of the
Russian, Austrian and German empires. The victors met at
Versailles and put Poland back on the map.
(He pushes two bread rolls from ‘east, ‘west’ and ‘south’
into the middle of the table.)
In 1920 the old enemy, now known as Soviet Russia,
invaded and was repulsed. Poland survived until the Nazi–
Soviet pact in 1939.
(He divides the six bread rolls and pushes them ‘east’ and
‘west’.)
The thieves fell out. Hitler lost. The allies met at Yalta to
carve up the map and Churchill and Roosevelt let Stalin
keep his prize.
(He moves three bread rolls from ‘west’ to ‘east’.)
This is a true picture, except for the bread rolls. You don’t
get a basket of bread rolls put out on a café table in
Poland.
However, it is now possible to speak of 1945.

Gomulka, was toppled in the Stalinist paranoia in 1948.
Eight years of bad times growing steadily worse finally in
1956 touched off a huge working-class revolt which left
eighty dead and brought Gomulka back as a reformer.
Things got worse. This time it took fourteen years.
Gomulka announced food price increases and touched off a
workers’ revolt in the Baltic ports in 1970. No one knows
how many died, some say as many as 200. The massacre
brought down Gomulka and elevated Edward Gierek.

12. INT. GIEREK’S ROOM

Telephone ringing. As GIEREK moves through the
frame:

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Things got better and then the same.

In 1976 Gierek announced food price increases. There
were strikes. Gierek backed down. Things got better, then
the same, then worse. Poland was going broke. In July
1980 Gierek announced food price increases. There were
strikes. Railwaymen closed one of the main lines into
Russia, or, to put it another way, one of the main lines into
Poland. Gierek went to the Black Sea to meet Brezhnev. On
August 14th the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk closed down.
Gierek flew home the next day. The Politburo met. Prime
Minister Babiuch went on television. Gierek went to the
country, hoping that the crisis was over.
(GIEREK answers the telephone. He listens for a few
moments, annoyed.)

GIEREK: (Into phone) You told me they would settle.

13. INT. PARTY HEADQUARTERS (POLITBURO). DAY

The Politburo is meeting again.

KANIA: It was in the balance. A majority at the shipyard voted

to end the strike. They were swung back by a radical
element. SZYDLAK: Reactionary. You mean a reactionary
element.

KANIA: The shipyard swung back to keep solidarity with the

places still on strike.

GIEREK: (Shakes his head impatiently) Solidarity.

KANIA: I said this one was not like the others. Now we’re no

longer 
dealing 
with 
a 
shipyard 
but 
a 
committee

representing 150 plants and factories.

SZYDLAK: (Furiously) The scum want to set up an independent

trade union! – They demand abolition of censorship –
access to the media – This is not a strike. It’s a bloody
mutiny!

GIEREK: (Sharply) It’s clear that the official trade unions have

lost touch with the aspirations of their membership. You
have forfeited their trust.

SZYDLAK: (Surprised) What kind of language is that?

GIEREK: You have let us down, Comrade! (More calmly)

Independent unions are, of course, out of the question. But
reform … yes. (Looks directly at SZYDLAK) A reform of the
official unions. (To KANIA) Now I will have to talk to them.

KANIA: Do you want me to come with you?

GIEREK: No – on TV. (To BABIUCH) My turn.

14. INT. TELEVISION STUDIO

GIEREK speaks to a single television camera. He is
apparently in his office, sitting at a desk, the office
bookcase behind him.

GIEREK: I would like to say as frankly as I can that we are

aware that quite apart from many objective factors,
mistakes in economic policy have played an important part
… We understand the working people’s tiredness and
impatience with the troubles of everyday life, the
shortages, the queues, the rise in the cost of living …
(Our camera has tilted slowly up, to find two ELECTRICIANS
standing on a gantry, looking down on GIEREK.)

FIRST ELECTRICIAN: I think I’ve seen this before …

SECOND ELECTRICIAN: Typical bloody August … nothing but

repeats.
(We cut to a different angle of GIEREK talking to the
television camera. We see his image on a monitor, being
watched by MACIEJ SZCZEPANSKI.)

GIEREK: (On monitor) But strikes do not change anything for

the better. Together we must find another way. We must do
it for Poland’s sake.
(This is the end of Gierek’s speech. He pauses a moment
and then relaxes as SZCZEPANSKI approaches him.)

SZCZEPANSKI: Good … very good. Congratulations, Comrade

First Secretary.

GIEREK: Thank you.

(GIEREK is gathering up his papers. He stands up.) 

SZCZEPANSKI: By the way, what did you think of the bookcase?

(GIEREK looks behind him as the bookcase, which is now
seen to be a fake flat, is moved aside by two PROP MEN.)

GIEREK: Nice. Very nice.

15. INT. SZCZEPANSKI’S OFFICE

SZCZEPANSKI is mixing cocktails.

SZCZEPANSKI: Edward, do things look bad?

GIEREK: For you, you mean?

SZCZEPANSKI: For me? Why for me? Try and come out this

weekend, relax a little.

GIEREK: How many cars do you have, Maciej?

SZCZEPANSKI: Cars? I don’t know. Who’s counting?

GIEREK: Kania.

SZCZEPANSKI: Kania? And what does he make it?

GIEREK: Eighteen.

SZCZEPANSKI: Eighteen? Well, Comrade, you know … as

Chairman of the State Committee for Radio and TV one
has to get about.

GIEREK: How many houses? An aeroplane. A yacht. A health

club staffed by young women with unusual qualifications
Yes, Comrade Kania has a file on you.

SZCZEPANSKI: That’s his job.

GIEREK: Yes. He undoubtedly has a file on me too. How much

was that little object you presented me with on my sixty-
fifth birthday?

SZCZEPANSKI: Well, it was gold. All right – who built your

country house? Twenty-three million zlotys. We serve the
Party. The Party rewards us. What do you say, Edward?

GIEREK: I think I’ll be busy this weekend.

16. INT. KURON’S FLAT. NIGHT

JACEK KURON and GEREMEK are watching GIEREK on
a television set.

GIEREK: (On television) Attempts by irresponsible individuals

and anarchic, anti-socialist groups to use stoppages for
political ends and to incite tension are a dangerous aspect
of recent events at plants on the Gdansk coast …
(GIEREK continues but the NARRATOR’s voice takes over.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Jacek Kuron, who now joins the story,

had a strategy for freedom in a Communist state – pay lip
service to Party rule while organizing into self-governing
groups, like unions.

GEREMEK: I think he’s talking about you, Jacek.

17. INT. GIEREK’S OFFICE. NIGHT

We see what is apparently the studio bookcase, but
the middle of it is a concealed door which now opens.
GIEREK comes through the bookcase to his desk and
we see that behind him there is another office with a
SECRETARY at a desk. The phone on Gierek’s desk is
ringing. GIEREK picks it up. He listens for a moment.

GIEREK: Lock him up.

18. EXT. STREET. NIGHT

KURON and GEREMEK are walking down the street.

NARRATOR: (Voice Over) Back in the sixties Kuron was a

radical Marxist calling for a revolutionary workers’ state.
The Polish United Workers’ Party did not appreciate him
and put him in gaol.
(KURON, in conversation, bursts out laughing.)

KURON: (Cheerfully) Now I’m rehabilitated. But I’m still

followed by the police.
(The camera tracks with them and finds the NARRATOR in
the foreground.)

HARRATOR: (To camera) The Polish intellectuals played no part

in the rebellion in 1970 which brought Edward Gierek to
power. But in ’76, when Gierek had to survive the first
rebellion of his own, Kuron and others, shocked by the
brutal police repression, formed the Workers’ Defence
Committee.
(Tracking again with KURON.)

KURON: (To GEREMEK) The Workers’ Defence Committee was

formed out of shame. When you get to Gdansk, tell them
that this time we won’t just leave them to it. This thing
could be amazing. Workers’ power, economic power, not a
rebellion but a social force. No blood in the streets. That
belongs to history.

GEREMEK: You think so?

KURON: Don’t you?

GEREMEK: History is my subject.

(They come to a corner and shake hands to separate.

GEREMEK moves off. Two POLICEMEN approach KURON and
arrest him, without drama, and walk him towards a nearby

police car. The NARRATOR is in the street, watching this.)

NARRATOR: Kuron and fourteen others were arrested on

August 20th. For Gierek the subversive influence of the
intellectual mavericks was the single most important
factor underlying the Polish crisis …
(He is interrupted by the WITNESS, who is now drunk.)

WITNESS: Horse manure.

(The NARRATOR turns.)

NARRATOR: What is?

WITNESS: Kuron and his friends have been overtaken by

events and they’re still trying to catch up.

NARRATOR: Then why arrest them?

WITNESS: Gierek has got to arrest someone. Every day

Brezhnev wants to know what’s being done. Every day the
answer is – nothing! Worse than nothing – negotiations
instead of breaking heads. So Gierek arrests a few
intellectuals. The Russians understand that. They’ve read
Marx, Gierek knows it’s irrelevant.

NARRATOR: Why doesn’t he arrest the strikers instead?

WITNESS: He can’t afford to.

NARRATOR: You mean he’s scared? Or broke?

WITNESS: Try the money.

(Another camera angle. The WITNESS weaves his way down
the street. The NARRATOR faces the camera.)

most important factor underlying –
(The WITNESS turns round and shouts to the NARRATOR.)

WITNESS: That’s the one!

(The camera tracks along the street, following a long fence
on which graffiti have been scrawled, crude pictures
illustrating the Narrator’s next speech.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Edward Gierek came to power

promising political and economic reforms. He intended to
go down in history as the man who turned Poland into a
modern industrial nation. And for a while it worked. Life
became freer and richer. The relaxation lasted a couple of
years. The money lasted longer, but it was all borrowed –
two billion by the middle of the decade, from the West
alone. The idea was that the money would be turned into
tractors, colour TVs, Polish Fiats … and then back into

money. But almost everything Polish, except what came
out of the ground, had a Western component which had to
be paid for in hard currency to keep the expensive new
factories in production, and with the oil crisis in 1973
those prices went up so more had to be borrowed, until
Poland’s industry was working just to pay the interest on a
debt which, by 1980, topped 20 billion dollars.

19. INT. BOARDROOM (BANK). DAY

Formal meeting room. There is a ‘round table’ of
BANKERS, FINANSKY among them. The Narrator’s
speech overlaps into this scene.

FINANSKY: When we met in April I proposed a loan of 500

million dollars which would enable us to refinance our
accumulated debt. This agreement proposes only 325
millions. In addition you propose a rate of interest above
the Eurodollar rate. This is disappointing, gentlemen. You
are endangering our ability to repay. This is the truth.

GERMAN BANKER: Minister, we represent more than 400 banks

from sixteen countries. To service your debt requires 95
per cent of your export revenue.

AMERICAN BANKER: American banks are badly exposed. 1.7
billion dollars. Just the commercial banks, quite apart from a

billion dollars in credits from my government.

FINANSKY: American banks are lending the same to Peru.

AMERICAN BANKER: Yes, and ten times as much to Brazil. But

these 
countries 
are 
members 
of 
the 
International

Monetary Fund, so the money does not come without
strings. We are in a position to insist on certain controls. In
your case we have no control.

SWISS BANKER: Your exports are being hit now with these

strikes …

FINANSKY: (Sharply) The strikes are in response to the price

increases which we were left in no doubt would be
welcome to you gentlemen when we began these present
negotiations

AMERICAN 
BANKER: (To his neighbour) Well, isn’t that

something? If Poland goes down the drain it’ll be the fault
of Chase Manhattan.

20. INT. EXECUTIVE WASHROOM. DAY

GIEREK is using a wash-basin. When he looks into the
mirror in front of him he sees two well-dressed, well-
shaved, well-groomed members of the Politburo,
JAGIELSKI and BARCIKOWSKI. They are standing
respectfully behind him, for instruction. GIEREK
busies himself with soap and water while he talks.

GIEREK: (To JAGIELSKI) In the Lenin shipyard there is a strike

committee representing 380 places of work.
(JAGIELSKI raises his eyebrows in surprise.)
Yes, we tried to split them with separate deals but they
weren’t having that. (To BARCIKOWSKI) There are 25,000 on
strike in Szczecin now. You will find a strike committee
waiting to negotiate.

JAGIELSKI: Kania says in Gdansk they have a list of sixteen

demands.

GIEREK: Twenty-one. Well, when they add the moon it will be

twenty-two.

BARCIKOWSKI: Is that what we promise them?

GIEREK: Just end the strike. (To JAGIELSKI) You did it with the

railway workers in July. You can do it with the shipyard.
(GIEREK ducks downs to wash his face.)

21. INT. THE SAME

As GIEREK straightens we see he is now dry, and
tying up his tie. In the mirror he sees JAGIELSKI and
BARCIKOWSKI returning now in very different shape,
unshaven, looking as though they had slept in their
clothes, exhausted.

BARCIKOWSKI: In Szczecin they make thirty-six demands,

beginning with free independent parties.

GIEREK: You mean unions.

BARCIKOWSKI: No. Parties. Political parties.

GIEREK: This is becoming grotesque.

BARCIKOWSKI: I told them I had come to discuss workers’

grievances, not an overthrow of the political system. They
accepted my point.

GIEREK: Good.

BARCIKOWSKI: And they told me that the first grievance is that

the official union does not represent the workers’ interest.
The demand for free unions is central, absolutely central.
The workers’ spokesman in Szczecin is a veteran of 1970 –
Marian Jurczyk – a strong Catholic. He demands also that
Sunday Mass be broadcast on state radio. He is tough,
very quiet, hard. When I arrived he did not even return my
greeting. He said – these are our demands. The
atmosphere is sober, unrelenting. No journalists, no
cameras.

JAGIELSKI: Gdansk is a circus. The negotiations are in a room

with a glass wall. On the other side of the glass there are
hundreds of people. No, not a circus, a zoo. Scores of
photographers. And every word we speak is broadcast all
over the shipyard. Walesa does most of their talking. He is
friendly, no intellectual but sharp, and he has the workers
behind him like a football hero.

BARCIKOWSKI: The situation is very strange – some of these are

our own people, Party members! You understand me,
Comrade First Secretary? The party itself is unstable.
(GIEREK, BARCIKOWSKI, JAGIELSKI leave the washroom. The

WITNESS, in the role of washroom attendant, approaches
the minor to tidy up after GIEREK.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Gierek’s chief concern now was to

maintain the Party line –
(The WITNESS, busy cleaning the wash-basin, looks up into
the mirror, interrupting the NARRATOR’s speech with a
shake of his head.)
(Correcting himself) – was to survive.
(The WITNESS nods approvingly.)

22. INT. SZCZEPANSKI’S OFFICE. NIGHT

There are sounds of a party going on next door.
SZCZEPANSKI, drinking, is brooding alone, watching
GIEREK mouthing silently on television. Using a
remote control he switches on a video recorder and
Gierek’s image is replaced by a mildly pornographic

film. Meanwhile, the NARRATOR is heard.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) A crisis meeting of the Central

Committee made a dramatic show of cleaning out the
stables. Four Politburo members were sacked, including
the Prime Minister and the official trades union chief.
There was a simultaneous purge of Party men in high
government posts, including the Chairman of the State
Committee for Radio and Television. Gierek was spared,
confessing to …
(SZCZEPANSKI switches the television set back to GIEREK.)

GIEREK: (On television) … errors, inconsistencies, delays and

hesitations. We owe an apology to those comrades who
pointed out irregularities, who tried to do something about
them …
(The office door opens, increasing the sound of the party
music. A party guest, a GIRL, enters.)

GIRL: Come on, Maciej – the party’s started without you.

SZCZEPANSKI: No. It’s over.

23. INT. TELEVISION STUDIO

For the moment we don’t know if we are in the
television studio or Gierek’s actual office. GIEREK sits
at his desk, the bookcase behind him. He has
evidently just finished addressing the camera. He
looks shattered. Abruptly he moves his chair back. It
hits the bookcase, which topples over.

24. INT. GIEREK’S OFFICE. NIGHT

Now GIEREK is at his ‘real’ desk with the ‘real’
bookcase behind him.
GIEREK, evidently at the end of his tether, mutters …

GIEREK: What will the Russians do?

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The single most important factor

underlying Poland’s independence was, needless to say –

WITNESS: (Voice over) The Church.

(Behind GIEREK the bookcase door opens. The SECRETARY is
showing in CARDINAL WYSZYNSKI.)

25. INT. CAFE. NIGHT

The NARRATOR and the WITNESS are sitting at a café
table.

NARRATOR: (To WITNESS) The Church?

WITNESS: The Church. Lech Walesa wears the Black Madonna

of Czȩstochowa on his coat. The King of Poland
consecrated the nation to her as recently as 1656 and just
the day before yesterday, when for the whole of the
nineteenth century there was no such place, the Poles
called their country the Christ among nations, and in the
Church they kept alive the promise of resurrection. As
with the Tsars so with Stalin. The years of terror
discredited the political guardians of the nation state, and
so the moral leadership fell to the Church. For the last
thirty-two years that has meant to Cardinal Wyszynski.

26. INT. GIEREK’S OFFICE. NIGHT

We pick up the shot as WYSZYNSKI is being shown
into the room.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Imprisoned and conciliated, from the

first years of Stalinist terror to the last years of Gierek’s 
ramshackle version of the consumer society, Cardinal
Wyszynski had been the spiritual leader of a people who,
by the irony of history, constituted the most vital Catholic
nation in Europe.
(Door shuts.)

GIEREK: Father, there will be blood. They won’t listen. They

will lose everything. You must talk to them before it’s too
late.

WYSZYNSKI: The Politburo?

GIEREK: The workers! The strikers! They demand things which

cannot be given.

WYSZYNSKI: They demand nothing which is not their right. It is

you who must listen. Or there will be blood. You will lose
everything.

GIEREK: No – no. The Russians will intervene if we don’t go

back. You must save us. Save the Church.

WYSZYNSKI: The Church needs to be defended sometimes but

it does not need to be saved.

GIEREK: (Weeping) Then save Poland …

(WYSZYNSKI gets up and leaves the room.)

27. INT. ANTE-ROOM. CONTINUATION

KANIA is waiting outside.

KANIA: (To WYSZYNSKI) How is he?

WYSZYNSKI: Better than I have seen him for a long time.

KANIA: His nerve has gone.

WYSZYNSKI: If you like.

KANIA: Can you help?

WYSZYNSKI: The Church does not resist an appeal. I will

preach on Tuesday. It is the Feast of the Black Madonna of
Czȩstochowa. I will speak as I must for the rights of
workers.

KANIA: These strikes harm the nation. We can’t fulfil every

demand at once.

WYSZYNSKI: I will speak the whole truth.

KANIA: How many will hear you?

WYSZYNSKI: My voice carries.

KANIA: With your permission I will assist it with television

cameras.

WYSZYNSKI: Not with my permission.

28. INT. PARTY HEADQUARTERS (POLITBURO). DAY

The Politburo is meeting. GIEREK sits in his usual
place. BABIUCH and SZYDLAK have gone. (Two other
Politburo members, anonymous ones as far as we are
concerned, have also been sacked, and there are
three new faces round the table.)

KANIA: We are no longer talking about the Baltic ports. There

are strikes in Wroclaw, in Warsaw, in the steel works, in
the mines of Silesia.
(The door opens as KANIA is speaking to admit a latecomer,

STEFAN OLSZOWSKI. OLSZOWSKI without ceremony responds to

KANIA.)

OLSZOWSKI: What about the army?

KANIA: Welcome, Comrade Olszowski.

JARUZELSKI: Welcome back, Comrade Olszowski.

(The MEMBERS get up generally and shake OLSZOWSKI’s hand
and welcome him back. OLSZOWSKI sits down.)

KANIA: Congratulations on your re-election. How was Berlin?

we don’t act now, with troops if necessary, we deserve
what we get.
(He looks directly at JARUZELSKI.)

JARUZELSKI: Yes. But not yet.

OLSZOWSKI: When?

JARUZELSKI: When there is no alternative.

OLSZOWSKI: When is that?

JARUZELSKI: I don’t know. I’ll tell you.

OLSZOWSKI: Next week? Next year?

JARUZELSKI: It depends on them.

OLSZOWSKI: On them?

then it depends on them. They will bring us to it, slowly or
quickly, but we’ll get there, you have my guarantee.

OLSZOWSKI: (To GIEREK) Comrade First Secretary …

and sign.

29. EXT. GDANSK SHIPYARD. DAY

There is a large crowd of noisy, celebrating DOCK
WORKERS and one man elevated above them on the
shoulders of his fellow workers – WALESA.

WITNESS: (Voice over) Jagielski and Lech Walesa signed the

Gdansk Agreement on August 31st. The impossible had
taken sixteen days. The inevitable was going to take
sixteen months.

Solidarity

30. EXT. PRISON. DAY

JACEK KURON is released from a prison cell by two
GUARDS.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The piece of paper signed in Gdansk

guaranteed much more than an independent trade union.
It spelled out the right to strike, freedom of expression,
the broadcasting of Mass, economic reforms, medical,
housing and welfare benefits, pensions and …
(The POLICEMAN leads KURON along the catwalk.)
… the freeing of political prisoners.
(KURON and his ESCORT walk along a corridor lined with
cells. From one of these a PRISONER shouts at him.)

PRISONER: Hey, Kuron! – is it just the bloody intelligentsia who

are being let out? I’ve redistributed more property than
you’ll ever see!

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Kuron went straight to Gdansk. For

two decades the drama of his intellectual life had been the
attempt to square the Communist circle inside the
cornerstones of democratic socialism, and now the show
had started without him.

31. EXT. STREET (GDANSK). DAY

WALESA is coming down the street in a scrum of
people, mostly JOURNALISTS, some with notebooks
and some with tape recorders and microphones.
Passers-by and general public are also drawn to the
scrum, which is quite a large crowd of people
altogether, thirty or forty. It is a travelling press
conference, with the questions distributed among the
JOURNALISTS, sometimes shouted from the fringe of
the scrum.

QUESTION: Lech, what are you going to do next?

WALESA: Eat dinner.

QUESTION: What is your dream?

WALESA: For Poland to be Poland.

QUESTION: What does that take?

WALESA: To eat dinner. To speak what we think. To come and

go as we please.

QUESTION: Are you a Marxist?

WALESA: How do I know? I never read a book.

QUESTION: What is your badge?

WALESA: (Touching the badge on his lapel) The Black

Madonna of Czȩstochowa, the holiest shrine in Poland.
Here I have a picture of her –
(He has small photographs of the Madonna, which he
hands out as he walks.)

QUESTION: What is your main task?

WALESA: To keep the movement together.

QUESTION: Why are you the leader?

WALESA: I’m the chairman. I’m not a dictator. Maybe a

democratic dictator.

QUESTION: What do you want to be?

WALESA: When I was an electrician I wanted to be the best.

QUESTION: What is the first thing the union has to do?

WALESA: Survive.

QUESTION: Who is the greater danger, Russia or the Party?

WALESA: Neither. Our greatest danger is ourselves. We must

learn restraint and patience or we’ll tear ourselves apart.

QUESTION: Do you want to overthrow the Party?

WALESA: No – I want the Party to be strong and to be just. A

weak party would be disastrous. I would have to join it.

QUESTION: Isn’t the union a challenge to the Party?

WALESA: 
The 
workers 
challenge 
themselves. 
They 
let

themselves down.

QUESTION: Do you want to go to America?

WALESA: I want to go everywhere and with Mother Mary on

my coat I will. But now I want to go home. As a husband
and father I also want to be the best. Also as a lover. I have
six children and my wife won’t forgive me for getting
mixed up in this. I will have to give her a seventh.
(He is extricating himself from the crowd.)

QUESTION: Lech – are you scared?

WALESA: I am scared of nothing and nobody, only of God.

(He has arrived at the doorway to the block of flats where
he lives. He disappears inside.)

32. INT. FLATS. DAY

WALESA comes up the staircase. On a landing there is
a small CHILD (one of Walesa’s children).

WALESA: What have you been doing?

CHILD: Having my picture taken.

(WALESA takes the CHILD by the hand and continues up the
stairs and then enters his own flat.)

33. INT. WALESA FLAT. DAY

There are several PHOTOGRAPHERS in the flat taking
photograph of the other CHILDREN and of DANUTA
(Mrs Walesa). She gives him a rueful look. He smiles
and shrugs.
The PHOTOGRAPHERS turn their attention to WALESA.
He sees that the phone is off the hook. He replaces
it.

JOURNALIST: Here, Lech …

(A journalist gives WALESA a carton of American [Marlboro]
cigarettes, WALESA nods and smiles. The phone rings.)

34. INT. BATHROOM (THE FLAT). DAY

WALESA is in the bath, pouring water over his head.

PHOTOGRAPHER: (Off-screen) This way, Lech.

(We see that there is a PHOTOGRAPHER in the bathroom with
him. The PHOTOGRAPHER takes several photographs using a
motordrive camera.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Everyone knew that Lech was special.

Pretty soon the outside world learned not to call him
Walesser or Valesser but Vawensa.

35. INT. SOLIDARITY MEETING ROOM. DAY

The meeting room is crowded. SOLIDARITY MEMBERS
are meeting each other, shaking hands. The crowd
includes Solidarity’s ‘ADVISERS’. There is a good deal
of self-introduction going on as the Narrator’s speech
identifies several of the individuals we are going to
be concerned with.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The names and faces multiply, and

there were many more than these. But it sorts itself out
like this …
The intellectuals who formed themselves around the union
as unofficial advisers included … Kuron … Geremek, the
historian … Mazowiecki, a radical Catholic journalist …
and Modzelewski, who had gone to gaol with Kuron in
1967 when the two of them, both radical Communists and
lecturers at Warsaw University, had written an open letter
attacking Party rule. Maszowiecki became Solidarity’s
press spokesman. Jurczyk, a storeman, led the strikers at
Szczecin … Gwiazda was the man perhaps closest to
Walesa. Allowing for simple demarcations, Gwiazda … and
Rulewski, who led one of the regional branches of the
union, were radicals who were to come into conflict with
Walesa’s more moderate line … Lis personified one of the
paradoxes of the situation, for he was a member of the
Communist Party … Bujak was the union’s leader in
Warsaw … and there were others like these whose names
the outside world never did get right, because –

36. EXT. SHIPYARD. DAY

NARRATOR: (Voice over) – the personality cult grew –

sensationally – around a thirty-seven-year-old electrician
whose combative, streetwise style had marked him out
long before he climbed over the steel fence of the Lenin
shipyard and found himself famous.
(WALESA has been walking through the shipyard, carrying a
yard-high model of the Gdansk Memorial. He is greeted on
all sides by WORKERS, and greetings are shouted at him
from distant  perches on cranes and gantries. WALESA
acknowledges the treatment like a star.)

He liked the attention. In months to come he would be on
scores of magazine covers and travel as far as Japan,
meeting the great. It caused resentment inside Solidarity,
but that was later.

37. INT. SOLIDARITY MEETING ROOM. CONTINUATION

WALESA, carrying the model of the memorial, enters
the room. He sees
KURON there and shouts towards him.

WALESA: Jacek … they let you out … do you want to make a

speech?

KURON: It’s your revolution. You tell us what you want us to

do.
(The meeting settles down around WALESA. WALESA puts the
model of the memorial on the table.)

WALESA: We have to make an organization. Suddenly everyone

has a free union. All over the country they’re saying, we’ll
have the same as Gdansk, thank you very much. I don’t
know. Maybe there should be no centralization; just
separate unions.

MAZOWIECKI: No. You have to be national, otherwise the Party

will pick you off piece by piece –

GEREMEK: – or break down into chaos trying to deal with you

separately. You have to have dialogue, not a general racket
going on. Stability. Discipline.

WALESA: So a national commission representing all the

regions?

MAZOWIECKI: Right.

WALESA: Yes – yes – you’re right – we have to act as one.

BUJAK: You mean if we want to strike in Warsaw we have to

come to Gdansk for permission?

WALESA: Yes – definitely –

GWIAZDA: What are we going to be? An alternative

bureaucracy? A Politburo?

WALESA: How we use our authority is up to us. If we are fair

we will use it fairly. For the good of all.

GWIAZDA: That’s Party language, Lech.

WALESA: No, it’s the language of democracy, stolen by the

Party. We’re a workers’ movement, not a mob. Local
strikes must have a majority at factory level first, and then
they must be ratified by a majority at the National
Commission in Gdansk.

JURCZYK: What is this Gdansk – Gdansk – Gdansk? We had a

strike at Szczecin. We also had a member of the Politburo
on his knees. We also signed an agreement. We had
everything you had except foreign journalists, and you
should have told them to mind their own business like we
did.

WALESA: I don’t care if the National Commission meets in

Szczecin or Katowice. It can meet in different places. It
can meet in a hot air balloon for all I care.

MAZOWIECKI: Don’t say that – the damn thing would never

come down.

WALESA: All right. We don’t even exist yet, legally. All we have

is a name. (To KURON) We’re taking the name of the strike
bulletin we published in the yard.
(He gives KURON a copy of the bulletin. KURON looks at it.)

KURON: Solidarity.

WALESA: We’ll have legal registration in a few weeks. The

statutes are being drafted now by our legal experts. You
see, intellectuals have their uses – though we had trouble
with them at first. They kept putting the word socialist into
the manifestos, and the workers kept taking it out.

KURON: Well, we didn’t know you were thinking of changing

the political system.

WALESA: We aren’t. We don’t want to govern. We don’t want to

be a threat.

GWIAZDA: What are you talking about? We are a threat. And

we are dealing with gangsters.

WALESA: We’re a union, that’s all.

GWIAZDA: Do you believe that?

WALESA: If we don’t believe it, how can they? Look, it’s like

this. The workers want bread. A decent wage. And a
proper machinery to represent them, to take their side,
and also a proper influence on the way things are
managed at work. We’re not political.

GWIAZDA: Most of our demands are political. What’s the most

important thing we’ve gained?

JURCZYK: The broadcasting of Mass.

GWIAZDA: Jesus God.

JURCZYK: Please don’t blaspheme.

GWIAZDA: Abolition of censorship – the right to strike – free

elections for the union – no more Party hacks holding down
jobs they don’t know how to do – free trade unions are
political.

MAZOWIECKI: He’s right.

GWIAZDA: We’re going to have to fight just to keep what we’ve

won – even to get what we’ve won. You’ll see when they
start breaking their promises.

WALESA: (To KURON) Is he right?

KURON: I said it was a revolution. The trick is to make it a self-

limiting revolution. The Party must keep the leading role.

LIS: I’m still a Party member. Lenin said the unions were the

connection between the Party and the workers.

problem. But an uncontrolled union reverses the current of
power. The Party won’t forgive. It will give up ground and
take its time, but in the end they still have the police and
the security forces. So go slowly. You can win little by
little, but remember, if you lose you will lose overnight.
(Snaps his fingers.) Like that.
(Everyone is sobered by this. The camera looks from face
to face. WALESA is looking at the model of the memorial.

KURON approaches him.)

WALESA: Look at this, Jacek. It’s going to be forty metres high,

outside the gate. We used to show up there every
December. With stones in our suitcases. We’d make a little
monument and the police would kick it over and take us
away. They won’t kick this over in a hurry.

KURON: I’ve always said that workers shouldn’t elect leaders

… it makes it too easy for the Party to identify the enemy.

WALESA: We’ll have safety in numbers. Thousands and

thousands 
are 
joining. 
Party 
members, 
too. 
They

understand. We’re an opposition. We’re reformers. The
Party needs reforming more than anybody else. Don’t
worry. We’ll have 10 million members.
(KURON smiles at his.)

I said we’d have a monument. Now I say we’ll have ten

million members.

38. INT. PARLIAMENT. DAY

The cut is to the members of the Politburo, who
appear to be sitting in the dock of a courtroom.
There are twelve of them, including JARUZELSKI,
KANIA, FINANSKY, PINKOWSKI (the Prime Minister) and
OLSZOWSKI. GIEREK is absent. The ‘dock’ is actually
the Politburo bench in parliament.

SPEAKER ONE: What we have witnessed in Gdansk, Comrades,

is an attack on the state organized by anarchists and anti-
socialist groups –
(This is greeted off-screen by loud protests.)

SPEAKER TWO: No, that’s not true – these are genuine

grievances – there is a failure in the Party, and it is at the
top of the Party!
(The applause for this covers the narration.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) This was parliament five days after the

Gdansk signing. The usual ventriloquist act had fallen
apart. The dummy had come to life.

SPEAKER THREE: We have become a rubber stamp for a Party

leadership which has lost its way. We are a sham society
built on propaganda which has become a joke. We have
sham planning, sham achievements in industry and
science, sham debates, sham elections, sham socialism,
sham justice, sham morality, and finally sham contentment
because no one can any longer tell the sham from the real.
(More applause over which – )

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The other odd thing was that the First

Secretary, Edward Gierek, was missing, and there was no
news of him.

39. INT. HOSPITAL VESTIBULE. EVENING

KANIA, carrying a large bunch of flowers, crosses.

40. INT. PRIVATE WARD. EVENING

The room is so full of people that at first one doesn’t

realize that GIEREK is in the hospital bed, apparently
unconscious. The people in the room are the
Politburo, 
who 
are 
animatedly 
discussing 
the

situation in small groups … eating the grapes,
drinking the barley water, examining the patient’s
chart. 
OLSZOWSKI is wearing headphones, 
the

hospital radio, and manipulating the wall-switch
which changes the channel. The switch is heavily
labelled: ‘Light music’, ‘Warsaw’, ‘Moscow’, ‘East
Berlin’, ‘Prague’.
KANIA enters.

JARUZELSKI: (To KANIA) Gierek’s had a heart attack. The Central

Committee is meeting tonight. We’ll have a new first
secretary by the morning.

KANIA: Does Stefan have hopes?

OLSZOWSKI: Quiet. I can’t hear a thing.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Stefan Olszowski had been in the

Politburo before until a disagreement over Gierek’s
economic policy shunted him into the Ambassador’s job in
East Berlin. Now the Central Committee had brought him
back. There was a hard line in the Party and Olszowski
spoke for it.

OLSZOWSKI: Moscow says there are no inherent defects in the

socialist system, it’s in the weakness of the leadership.
(Turns the dial from ‘Moscow’ to ‘East Berlin’.) And as for
the Germans …
(He reels back as the Germans nearly blow his ear out.)

41. INT. CAFE. NIGHT

The NARRATOR and the WITNESS are at a table
playing chess. It seems to be the Witness’s move. He
is frowning at the board.

NARRATOR: (To camera) But the Central Committee did not

advance Stefan Olszowski. It was not the moment to attack
on the left.

WITNESS: Why is it always chess?

NARRATOR: Ugh, well, you know, it symbolizes …

WITNESS: These ones with horse’s heads, are they the ones

which can jump over things?

NARRATOR: You’re ruining it.

WITNESS: Sorry.

NARRATOR: (To camera) The mood was for reform, renewal,

nothing too liberal, but no conservative blacklash. A
middle of-the-road apparatchik with a tough background in
security but with nothing of the zealot about him would do.
Kania had the job by 2 a.m.

42. INT. KREMLIN. DAY

BREZHNEV and a SECRETARY, in an office. BREZHNEV
is standing on a chair, being measured by a TAILOR.

BREZHNEV: (Dictating) Dear Kania – get things back to normal

or we’ll be down on you like a ton of bricks. Read that
back.

SECRETARY: Dear Comrade Kania, the working people of the

Soviet Union know you as a staunch champion of the
people’s true interests, the ideals of Communism, the
strengthening of the leading role of the Party, and the
consolidation of socialism in the Polish People’s Republic.
(It goes on like that but we fade him out …)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) But Kania, in his first public

statement, pledged himself to the spirit of Gdansk.

43. INT. KANIA’S OFFICE. DAY

KANIA is behind his desk.

KANIA: (To camera) The Party will reform itself, workers will

work, the citizens will have more freedom, the newspapers
will report the facts, radio will broadcast Mass, the hacks
will be sacked, corruption will be stamped out, and Poland
will be in charge of her own destiny throughout. It’s all
going to be all right.

44. INT. CAFE. DAY

The NARRATOR and the WITNESS are now playing
cards.

WITNESS: Twist.

(The NARRATOR deals him a card.)

NARRATOR: (To camera) But it was a bluff and Kania knew it.

WITNESS: Bust.

45. INT. KANIA’S OFFICE. DAY

KANIA is behind his desk as before.

KANIA: The Soviet Union supplies us with all our crude oil,

potash and iron ore, and 80 per cent of our natural gas
and our timber. The August strikes have cost us zillions of
zlotys and they aren’t finished. All over the place workers
have caught Gdansk disease. And all over the place the fat
cats of the Party apparatus and the old union are digging
in against what they call an anti-socialist sell-out. It’s not
going to be a picnic.

46. EXT. STEELWORKS. GDANSK. DAY

Gate with flowers in foreground.
Camera drops to take in steelworks as gates are
shut.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The wheel of reform was moving so

slowly that to give it a shove the union announced a token
one-hour strike for October 3rd. With a week to go, the
Solidarity leadership came to Warsaw to apply for legal
registration.
(Hooters go off.)

47. INT. COURTROOM. DAY

WALESA is alone in the room. A door opens and KANIA
enters.

KANIA: Comrade Walesa.

(They shake hands.)

WALESA: Congratulations, Comrade First Secretary, on your

elevation.

KANIA: Likewise. Please sit down, Comrade. Comrade Walesa,

when I was elected First Secretary I told the Central
Committee that I intended to use the collective wisdom of

the people. A strike is not the act of wisdom.

WALESA: A stoppage, for one hour.

KANIA: But a million people, even for one hour, is a

provocative symbol to our allies.

WALESA: It’s going to be 3 million, Comrade First Secretary.

KANIA: I’m dying to help you but I have suspicious and angry

people behind me.

WALESA: That’s my position also.

(KANIA thumps the table angrily.)

KANIA: The proletariat cannot dictate to the Party what –

(He collects himself. People are filing into the room. The
two men begin whispering.)
In the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Party must have
the leading role.

WALESA: We accept that.

KANIA: But you haven’t said so in the legal statutes which

have been deposited with the Warsaw Provincial Court.

WALESA: We haven’t said so because we are not a political

organization. The leading role of the Party is nothing to do
with us.

KANIA: The leading role of the Party is to do with everybody!

WALESA: To acknowledge it in the statutes would be a political

act.

KANIA: To refuse to acknowledge it is a political act.

(Now we see that the room is full of people.)

WALESA: The independence of the free trade union Solidarity

is not negotiable. We are waiting for the decision of the
Court. Then we will know if this game is honest.
(Close-up on a JUDGE.)

JUDGE: The registration of the independent trade union

Solidarity is allowed.
(On the reverse shot WALESA smiles briefly at GWIAZDA, who,
however, holds up his hand as if to say, ‘Not so fast.’)
But, the statutes of the union are modified to include the
acknowledgement of the leading role of the –

WALESA: The Court has no power to alter the statutes!

GWIAZDA: (Furiously to WALESA) Now will you believe me! We’re

dealing with gangsters!

48. EXT. BALCONY. DAY

We see a line-up of the PARTY BOSSES, just heads and
shoulders above the parapet. They are dressed like
gangsters. They look out front, possibly reviewing a
parade, and talk among themselves out of the sides
of their mouths.

KANIA: The Walesa mob is calling a general strike.

OLSZOWSKI: Rub them out.

KANIA: There’s three million of them!

GANG MEMBER: Four million, boss.

KANIA: Shut up!

JARUZELSKI: (To KANIA) It was the wrong time to pull a stunt

like that.

49. EXT. STREET. DAY

NARRATOR and WITNESS appear to be among the
crowd looking up at the Politburo’s balcony.

WITNESS: What’s all this gangster stuff?

NARRATOR: It’s a metaphor.

WITNESS: Wrong. You people –

NARRATOR: All right.

50. EXT. BALCONY. DAY. CONTINUATION

Now the people on the balcony are no longer dressed
as gangsters. They speak normally too.

JARUZELSKI: It was the wrong time for a confrontation.

KANIA: You haven’t had Comrade Brezhnev shouting down the

telephone –

JARUZELSKI: Comrade Brezhnev only demands stability. Throw

the dogs a few bones. Leave the statutes of the union as
they are, and put whatever you want into an appendix.
Walesa will help us if we help him. And when the time
comes …

51. INT. SOLIDARITY MEETING ROOM. DAY

WALESA, FAMILY and OTHERS are kneeling. A PRIEST
is holding Mass.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) And so the deal was made. Solidarity

was legal. And Mass was on the radio. The regime lost face
but stood to gain a period of calm – so long as the
moderate men on either side were in control.

52. INT. WARSAW SOLIDARITY OFFICE. NIGHT

A Solidarity poster is on the office window. Close-up
of Solidarity poster. A group of POLICEMEN enter the
office and immediately begin ransacking it. The only
occupant is BUJAK. BUJAK stands up.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The calm lasted nine days.

BUJAK: What the hell is going on?

(The OFFICER IN CHARGE hands him the warrant. The other

OFFICERS are emptying filing cabinet drawers on the the
floor.)

53. INT. KANIA’S BEDROOM. NIGHT

Telephone rings. Light goes on. KANIA picks up
receiver.

KANIA: (Angrily) On whose orders?

54. INT. WALESA’S FLAT. NIGHT

The phone is ringing. WALESA, in night clothes,
finally answers it.

WALESA: (Into phone) Yes –?

(In the near dark he listens and feels for the light switch.
He puts the light on.)
Jesus and Mary …

55. INT. SOLIDARITY MEETING ROOM. GDANSK. DAY

A meeting of the Praesidium with WALESA in the
chair. There are about a dozen others, including a
young woman (ALINA PIENKOWSKA), and BOGDAN LIS
and ANDRZEJ GWIAZDA. BUJAK, talking to them, is the
only one standing up.

BUJAK: They broke into the Solidarity office in Warsaw and

found what they say is a secret document. They have
arrested our printer and also a clerk in the Prosecutor’s
office. They claim he leaked the document to us. Warsaw
Solidarity has called a strike of the entire region, if both
men are not released.

WALESA: Excuse me. A strike is not called by the regional

office, only by the National Commission of the Union.

BUJAK: Then you’d better call it. Work has already stopped at

Ursus Tractors. What’s more, we are demanding as a
condition of calling off the strike an investigation into the
methods of the Prosecutor’s office and of the security
police. We’re demanding cuts in the police budget and also
the punishment of those who committed the police
brutalities in ’70 and ’76.
(WALESA looks despairing.)

when the stakes get higher?

56. INT. KANIA’S OFFICE. DAY

KANIA has the PUBLIC PROSECUTOR standing across
the desk.

KANIA: Comrade Prosecutor – are we to have a confrontation

with a million workers over a miserable document?

PROSECUTOR: It is a classified document – a secret circular

prepared by myself, on the organization of the anti-
socialist groups. Furthermore, it is a stolen document. We
have a good case for prosecution.

KANIA: 
(Angrily) 
The 
document 
contains 
nothing 
of

importance. I have said on behalf of the Party, in public,
that we offer Solidarity coexistence. These arrests merely
make me look like a liar.

57. INT. SOLIDARITY MEETING ROOM. GDANSK. DAY

WALESA and the Praesidium (same people as scene
55).

WALESA: (Strongly) These demands against the security police

– they can’t be made in the name of the union. We are a

non-political organization. It was a pledge. Do you want to
ruin everything?

58. EXT. STEELWORKS. DAY

It is snowing. A high shot shows us the works at a
standstill. Groups of STEEL WORKERS stand around. A
small group is waiting for WALESA, BUJAK and KURON,
who are walking purposefully towards the waiting
delegation of WORKERS.
When the two small groups arrive face to face we go
into a closer shot.

BUJAK: Where can we talk?

59. EXT. STEELWORKS. DAY

BUJAK, KURON and WALESA are huddled under the
steps with the small group of STEEL WORKERS, one of
whom acts as a spokesman. Snow continues to fall.

BUJAK: It is very simple. We demanded the release of the two

men. The Government has delivered them. We have to
deliver the end of the strike.

STEEL WORKER: Our demands have not been satisfied.

WALESA: Your demands did not have the sanction of Gdansk.

STEEL WORKER: We are not in Gdansk. We are in Warsaw.

Furthermore, our region is much bigger than the Gdansk
region.

KURON: My friend, there is another reality beyond the

immediate issue.

STEEL WORKER: Who is he?

KURON: I am Jacek Kuron.

STEEL WORKER: You’re not a worker.

KURON: This is not an argument between you and the police. It

is an argument between millions of Poles and the regime.

STEEL WORKER: No, it is between us and the police. In ’76,

when the Government raised prices, we went on strike and
we won. They caved in. Afterwards the police made us run
the gauntlet of truncheons. We were beaten unconscious,
they smashed our bones. Who was ever punished for those

crimes?

KURON: (Helplessly) Lech?

WALESA: What can I say?

BUJAK: You don’t have to tell these men about the police. They

have been in cells and in gaol. The Government has agreed
to talk about the responsibility of the police.

STEEL WORKER: In private they will say anything.

BUJAK: The talks on police were announced on television

tonight.

STEEL WORKER: Talks are not what we asked for. They

guarantee nothing.

WALESA: (Rather dramatically) I am your guarantee!

(Self-consciously he amends this.) We are your guarantee.

60. INT. FIRST SECRETARY’S OFFICE (KANIA). MORNING

KANIA is being shaved, by, as it turns out, the
WITNESS.

KANIA: There are people who think that the Party boss can run

the operation like a Chicago gangster. They should try
sitting in this chair. I’ve got a Party which is losing
members in droves, and half of those who remain have
joined a free trade union with five million members –

WITNESS: (Discreetly correcting) Seven million.

KANIA: (Taking the correction without comment) Seven

million. With the right to strike for more money which I
haven’t got because industrial production is down 12 per
cent owing to the strikes, so I have to go cap in hand to the
Soviets, who are giving us 690 million dollars in credits to
keep Poland Communist. And to the United States, who
are giving us 550 million dollars for the same reason. I’ve
got a rank and file which wants to know when I’m going to
reform the middle apparatus, and I’ve got a middle
apparatus which wants to know when I’m going to stop the
rot in the rank and file, and a leadership which is waiting
to see which way the cat will jump. I’ve got a Catholic
Church which doesn’t want me to provoke the Russians,
and a Communist Party two-thirds of whom believe in God.
And to top it all off I’ve got a police force which can’t
break the habit, and a Public Prosecutor with the political

nous of a bull in a china shop. As First Secretary of the
Polish United Workers’ Party, Al Capone wouldn’t have
lasted out the week.
(The INTERCOM on the desk announces …)

INTERCOM: His Excellency the Soviet Ambassador is here.

61. INT. KANIA’S OFFICE. ANOTHER SECTION. DAY

KANIA leads the AMBASSADOR into the room, shows
him to a chair. They sit.

KANIA: Good morning, Ambassador.

AMBASSADOR: Good morning, Comrade. You’re looking tired.

KANIA: How can I help you, Ambassador?

AMBASSADOR: Comrade Brezhnev wishes to inform you that a

meeting of the leaders of the Warsaw Pact is to take place
in Moscow in eight days’ time. Comrade Brezhnev asks me
to convey his fraternal greetings and looks forward to
seeing you on December 5th.

KANIA: (Examining his diary) I’ll have to cancel a lunch. I

accept with pleasure, of course. I ask you to return my
greetings when you have an opportunity.

AMBASSADOR: I have many opportunities, Comrade First

Secretary. Comrade Brezhnev is taking a very close
interest in events here.

KANIA: Naturally. We are grateful for his interest.

AMBASSADOR: The situation is interesting. The Warsaw strike.

The general strike which is due to begin in four hours …

KANIA: There are no Warsaw strikes this morning. There will

be no general strike either.

AMBASSADOR: That is very good news. It is very important to us

that the Party should not show weakness.

KANIA: Quite so.

AMBASSADOR: And your two prisoners?

KANIA: Prisoners?

AMBASSADOR: The saboteurs arrested a week ago.

KANIA: You have been misinformed, Ambassador. Two men

were detained on suspicion but the suspicion proved
unfounded. The men were released very early this
morning.

AMBASSADOR: I see.

KANIA: It is delightful to have seen you again.

AMBASSADOR: You won’t forget? Moscow, December 5th.

(The AMBASSADOR stands up and leaves the room.)

62. INT. KREMLIN. DAY

This is the meeting of the Warsaw Pact leaders.
BREZHNEV is chairman. The Polish group consists of
KANIA, PINKOWSKI (the last-seen prime minister),
BARCIKOWSKI and OLSZOWSKI and JARUZELSKI. There
is a little Polish flag on the table in front of them. At
intervals around the large table there are the flags of
Hungary, East Germany, Poland, Romania and
Czechoslovakia. The only person standing is one of
the Germans, who is half-way through a tirade,
backed up by a pile of documents, including a sheaf
of Solidarity magazines. He is referring to these one
by one.

GERMAN MINISTER: Item – a blatant attack on the person of the

Regional Chairman of the Party. Item – a blatant attack on
the office of the Public Prosecutor. Item – a blatant attack
on the principle of peasant collectives. And so it goes on.
These publications, openly printed and distributed by
Solidarity, are an attack on socialism, an attack on
everyone here, and I tell you this, Comrades, if the day
comes when we in the German Democratic Republic allow
the publication of filth like this, then you are free to
assume that we objectively agree with it.
(He sits down. Pause. BREZHNEV speaks without standing
up, in a fairly friendly manner, looking straight across at
the Polish leaders.)

BREZHNEV: You know, we had our very own Soviet free trade

union. I forget his name. He is in a lunatic asylum now,
poor fellow … You see, a Communist Party which cannot
defend itself is no damn use, that is the problem. If it
cannot defend itself, it must be defended.

63. EXT. BUNKER. DAY

All we see is a group of perhaps half a dozen very
high-ranking
MILITARY 
OFFICERS 
dressed 
in 
cold-weather

greatcoats, standing at a vantage point, their
attention 
on 
events 
in 
the 
distance, 
events

characterized by the sounds of military vehicles and
high explosives. It is a relaxed group. One or two of
them may be smoking. Each of them has a pair of
binoculars which he uses occasionally. The uniforms
belong to the armies of the Warsaw Pact countries.
We are concerned with GENERAL JARUZELSKI and
MARSHAL KULIKOV, who are standing next to each
other. They are cold. They raise their binoculars.

NARRATOR: 
(Voice 
over) 
During 
these 
December 
days

reservists were called up in the Baltic Soviet Republics.
Soviet troops camped under canvas on the Polish border,
and Soviet warships were visible from the coast. The
United 
States 
Intelligence 
announced 
that 
Russian

invasion plans were complete.
(KULIKOV lowers his binoculars.)

KULIKOV: Well, I don’t know what all this is doing to the Poles

but it’s scaring the hell out of the Americans.

JARUZELSKI: We can deal with our own problems, Marshal.

KULIKOV: We all hope so, Wojciech.

64. EXT. THE GDANSK MEMORIAL INAUGURATION.

NIGHT

A crowd of people holding candles. It is snowing.
There is the sound of the ‘Lacrimosa’ from Krzysztof
Penderecki’s Chorale.
The floodlights illuminate the Solidarity banners.
We see WALESA dressed up for the winter cold. He
wears a brown anorak. Around him, casually but
warmly dressed, are other WORKERS and LEADERS of
Solidarity. There are also the men of Warsaw in
heavy overcoats. There is a GENERAL in uniform and

an ADMIRAL in uniform. There are PRIESTS.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) On December 16th, the rulers and the

ruled came together to inaugurate the Gdansk Memorial to
the dead of 1970. The Solidarity banners were consecrated
by an archbishop. There was an army general, an admiral,
a deputy member of the Politburo, a government minister
and the Head of State, the ageing Professor Jablonski.
There were diplomats of many foreign countries. There
were 150,000 people gathered outside the gates of the
Lenin shipyard. Lech Walesa, unknown six months before,
now leader of a union of 10 million workers, lit the flame.
It was the first time in a Communist country that a
government had erected a memorial to workers who had
rebelled against the state. The First Secretary of the Polish
United Workers’ Party and the Soviet Ambassador did not
attend.

Congress

65. INT. CONFESSIONAL. DAY

WALESA, with his ear pressed to the grille, is
listening intently and rapidly making notes in a
notebook.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) In the middle of January Lech Walesa

went to Rome … and, according to Prague Radio, got his
instructions straight from the Pope.
(Caption: Courtesy of Prague Radio)

WALESA: (Muttering) Yes, Father, attack the principles of

socialist construction, very well, Father …

66. INT. SOLIDARITY MEETING ROOM. GDANSK. DAY

A large, disorganized, rowdy meeting of Solidarity
people. 
They 
are 
members 
of 
the 
National

Commission and we know a few of them.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Solidarity was in fact in endless

dispute with the Government, which seemed unable or
unwilling to concede what had been agreed in Gdansk. The
Government had back-tracked on the five-day week, access
to the media, censorship, and the right of private farmers
to set up a Rural Solidarity of their own. There were
strikes and sit-ins all over the country. The National
Commission tried to tidy all this up by calling for a one-
hour general strike …
(The meeting has suddenly pulled itself together, the
background noise stilled as everybody there raises one
arm in the air.)
… while ordering an end to local strikes. But the second
part of that had no effect …
(The meeting once more disintegrates into dispute and
noise.)
The country seemed bemused and helpless in the face of

all these demands. As always, there was a Polish joke for
the occasion.
(Caption: Polish Joke)
(The meeting is suddenly stilled as a WORKER shouts.)

WORKER: I move that from now on we only work on Tuesdays!

(The meeting agrees by acclamation. However, the

WITNESS, who is present, raises his hand and the meeting
goes quiet again to listen to him.)

WITNESS: Do you mean every Tuesday?

67. INT. OFFICE (PRIME MINISTER). DAY

WALESA and PRIME MINISTER PINKOWSKI are putting
their signatures to a document.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Walesa went into a twelve-hour

meeting with the Prime Minister, who at this time and for
several days to come was called Mr Pinkowski. They
reached an agreement which pleased neither side. On
February 9th, Pinkowski was replaced. In Poland such a
change was normally cosmetic, but this time it looked
different.

68. EXT. STREET. DAY

An official car draws up and a fawning FUNCTIONARY
comes up to open the rear door, out of which comes
PRIME MINISTER GENERAL JARUZELSKI.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The new Prime Minister liked to make

unannounced visits …

69. INT. FOOD SHOP. DAY

NARRATOR: (Voice over) … sometimes to shops.

(There is busy activity in the shop. Groceries of all kinds
are being hastily unpacked from boxes and placed on
empty shelves. When the shelves look fairly full, the PRIME

MINISTER and his ENTOURAGE are seen to enter the shop.
There is much handshaking and smiling as the GENERAL
passes through.

JARUZELSKI: And how is the food distribution?

PARTY OFFICIAL: It is working very well, Comrade.

JARUZELSKI: Good, good.

(He passes rapidly through. As soon as he has gone all the
groceries are quickly removed and repacked.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Jaruzelski began by asking for a three

months’ suspension of strike action – for, as he put it,
ninety peaceful days. He got thirty-eight.

70. EXT. STREET. NIGHT

The cut is to a fight. Smoke bombs. Crowds scatter.
RULEWSKI and other men are being beaten up by a
group of plain-clothes SECURITY POLICE.

71. INT. HOSPITAL VESTIBULE. NIGHT

A group is walking purposefully along the corridor
towards us.
WALESA is in the lead. A PRIEST is behind him.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The trouble happened in Bydgoszcz,

where the farmers, with the support of the local Solidarity
leader, Jan Rulewski, staged a peaceful protest against the
authorities’ refusal to allow an independent farmers’
union. The uniformed militia were called but there was no
violence until the plain-clothes state security police moved
in. Rulewski was badly beaten up.

PRIEST: Wisdom. Not vengeance. Wisdom.

72. INT. HOSPITAL WARD. NIGHT

The injured RULEWSKI is in bed. WALESA and the
PRIEST enter the ward and come to the bed.

RULEWSKI: Yes – I heard you had a priest now.

WALESA: Jan. How are you feeling?

RULEWSKI: No – you talk.

WALESA: A warning strike within the week. A general strike

after that if we don’t get satisfaction.

RULEWSKI: Somebody ordered it. This was an attack on

Solidarity by the Government.

WALESA: No. It was an attack on the Government’s agreement

with Solidarity. That’s the best way to play it. We’ll
announce a strike in support of the Government of General
Jaruzelski.

73. INT. OFFICE. NIGHT

JARUZELSKI holding a telephone.

JARUZELSKI: Tell him not to do us any favours.

74. INT. PARTY HEADQUARTERS (VESTIBULE). NIGHT

MIECZYSLAW RAKOWSKI is holding a telephone to his
ear, listening.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Jaruzelski’s first appointment was to

make Mieczyslaw Rakowski Deputy Prime Minister, with
special responsibility for the unions. From now on,
Rakowski, the editor of an influential political weekly, was
going to do most of the talking to Solidarity.
(RAKOWSKI has meanwhile put the phone down and
approached WALESA, who, we now see, is standing in the
lobby.)

RAKOWSKI: While we’re standing here the armies of the

Warsaw Pact are conducting exercises on Polish soil. Your
warning strike was the greatest disruption of work in the
history of this country.
(WALESA looks surprised.)
I mean in the history of the Polish People’s Republic. If the
general strike goes ahead we could end up with Soviet
tanks lined up in the square outside.

WALESA: You’ve played the Russian card too many times.

Blood has been spilled. Twenty-seven citizens of the Polish
People’s Republic who were not breaking any law have
been injured in an assault by the state police in the city of
Bydgoszcz. Three of them are in hospital. Does this have
your approval?

RAKOWSKI: There will be an investigation, of course.

WALESA: Another card.

RAKOWSKI: We’ll punish those responsible for the assault. You

may have my guarantee. But the strike must be called off.

WALESA: It’s not my decision. But your offer is not enough.

RAKOWSKI: All right, we also guarantee that the question of the

farmers’ union will be examined by a parliamentary
commission. And you know what that means with this
parliament. It’ll only be a matter of time. But we can’t
move faster than the Party lets us. You understand. The
Party must have the leading role. That is Communism.

WALESA: And independent unions, is that Communism?

RAKOWSKI: Don’t underestimate Polish Communism. We’ve got

less than twenty-four hours before the strike goes ahead
and all this is put at risk. What are you going to do?

75. INT. SOLIDARITY MEETING ROOM (GDANSK). DAY

WALESA is there with GWIAZDA and MODZELEWSKI.
GWIAZDA is angry.

GWIAZDA: No.

WALESA: We’ve got most of what we wanted.

GWIAZDA: It’s not up to us. The National Commission decided

on the strike. If it’s going to be called off, the National
Commission has to meet to vote on it.

WALESA: (Desperately) There isn’t time for that. We have to

make it an executive decision.

MODZELEWSKI: You mean your decision. This whole business

has been about as democratic as a Pharaoh’s court. You’re
taking too much upon yourself, Lech.

WALESA: Nobody wants this strike. Do you want it?

MODZELEWSKI: I don’t want the strike. I don’t want any part of

this decision. We went to a lot of trouble to make a
democratic union. This is just getting to be Walesa’s
circus. I’m going back to Wroclaw to teach my students
about democracy – you can get yourself another press
officer.

WALESA: You’re making a dogma out of procedure. Right and

wrong is more important. A strike now would be wrong.
And there isn’t time. I’m putting this to the vote of the
Praesidium. Let it be on my head. When the National
Commission has time to meet, they can have it on a platter.

MODZELEWSKI: Right. I resign. (To GWIAZDA) How about you?

WALESA: (To GWIAZDA) You can only resign once, Andrzej.

(MODZELEWSKI starts to pick up his briefcase to leave.)

GWIAZDA: They’ve split us.

76. INT. POLITBURO. DAY

Everybody is there and the mood is buoyant.

RAKOWSKI: (Triumphantly) We’ve split them!

(RAKOWSKI is being slapped on the back by JARUZELSKI …)

KANIA: That’s it! Get them at each other’s throats!

(But this picture freezes and tears itself in half like a piece
of paper with the sound of tearing paper.)

77. INT. CAFE. DAY

The NARRATOR is scribbling at a table. He stops and
crumples up the paper and throws it away. He is
being watched by the WITNESS.

WITNESS: Try the other one.

78. INT. POLITBURO. DAY

As before.

RAKOWSKI: (Gloomily) We’ve split them!

KANIA: (Gloomily) How can we control them if they’re at each

other’s throats all the time?
(The picture freezes and tears itself in half like paper with
the sound of tearing paper.)

79. INT. CAFE. DAY

NARRATOR and WITNESS.

NARRATOR: I don’t understand who’s winning.

WITNESS: Or who’s being split.

NARRATOR: (Interested) Is that it?

WITNESS: These people aren’t smart. They’re Party bosses.

80. INT. POLITBURO. DAY

As before.

KANIA: They’ve split us.

WITNESS: (Voice over) That’s the one.

sanctioned which wants to speed up reform. In Katowice
there’s another meeting which thinks Stalin is alive and
well and is practically begging the Soviets to come in and
save Communism. I’ve got hundreds of complaints from
the rank and file. People want to know why we haven’t
punished the police who did the beating up. They want to
know why we haven’t expelled more Party members for
bribery and theft, although we’ve expelled thousands.
They demand an emergency Party Congress and I can’t
stop it. They will elect to the Congress hundreds of people
we can’t rely on. In the grass roots of the Party there are
meetings between workers in different factories, different
cities. Lenin called it the sin of horizontalism. He
organized the Party on vertical lines, control from top to
bottom. This is why. I’m getting demands for secret voting
for the Party Congress, unlimited candidates, limited terms
of office, accountability to the base instead of to the
leadership. How long do you think we’d last if that
happened? How long would Comrade Brezhnev and his
colleagues last if it started to spread?

81. INT. KREMLIN. DAY

BREZHNEV is dictating a letter. There is a SECRETARY
taking it down.

BREZHNEV: To the Central Committee of the Polish United

Workers’ Party from the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Dear lads. Let me
spell it out for you. You were elected by the last Party
Congress under Gierek, and quite obviously you’re going
to be out on your neck when the next Party Congress
meets four weeks from now, so this is your last chance.
When Kania and Jaruzelski were here in December they
kept agreeing with me but ever since then they’ve let the
Party drift into open democracy, make that bourgeois
democracy, and look what happened to the Czechs just
before they had their emergency Congress in ’68 – say no
more.

82. INT. POLITBURO. DAY

OLSZOWSKI is reading Brezhnev’s letter to the
chastened Politburo.

OLSZOWSKI: This letter is an invitation to the Central

Committee to change the leadership. Brezhnev has lost
faith in the Polish Party. And who can blame him when
even Soviet war memorials in Warsaw are being defaced?

83. EXT. SOVIET WAR MEMORIAL. NIGHT

The memorial has been daubed with white paint.
Sitting on top of the memorial, busy, with scrubbing
brush and bucket of water, is WALESA. Standing on
the plinth, watching him, is KURON.

WALESA: The memorials are being defaced by provocateurs.

I’ve offered to scrub them with my own hands, on TV if
they like. As a union we take no position on Russia.

KURON: You take every position including that one up there.

You started something which you can’t stop. You want a
self-limiting revolution but it’s like trying to limit influenza.

WALESA: Yes, it’s those bloody workers. You give us freedom of

choice, and we choose freedom. What I want to know is,
how did you get to be called the intellectuals?

84. INT. BREZHNEV’S OFFICE (KREMLIN). DAY

BREZHNEV is having a medical examination. He is
stripped to the waist and is attended by a DOCTOR.
BREZHNEV’S SECRETARY is standing to one side
holding a file.

BREZHNEV: What’s the latest?

DOCTOR: No change.

BREZHNEV: I mean him.

(The SECRETARY steps forward.)

SECRETARY: Which first sir?

BREZHNEV: Afghanistan.

(The SECRETARY shuffles his files.)
No, Poland. The Central Committee. Reaction to my letter.

SECRETARY: A strong attack on Kania’s leadership in the

Central Committee, and calls for his resignation.

BREZHNEV: (Pleased) And they think I’m losing my touch.

SECRETARY: However …

BREZHNEV: However what?

SECRETARY: A counter-attack arguing that if the hard-liners

take over, the country will be polarized, with civil
disobedience and strikes, and if we invade, Soviet
Communism will be finished in Poland and détente with
the Americans will be dead.

BREZHNEV: (As the DOCTOR takes his blood pressure) Now he

takes my blood pressure.

SECRETARY: The entire Politburo offered themselves for a vote

of confidence. The Central Committee declined the offer
and proposed no changes in the leadership.

BREZHNEV: I see. And the Emergency Party Congress is still to

come. I look forward to meeting the Polish leader when I
go to the seaside next month. I wonder if he will be a
Communist.

85. EXT. SEA SHORE. DAY

This is the same shot as scene I. The beach and the
sea. Everything is the same except that KANIA has
replaced GIEREK.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) In August 1981 Stanislaw Kania, First

Secretary of the Polish United Workers’ Party, left Warsaw
for his annual holiday in the Soviet Union by the Black
Sea. There he met Leonid Brezhnev, First Secretary of the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
(The two men, in hats, coats and lace-up shoes, come
together and embrace.)
In an atmosphere of cordiality and complete mutual
understanding the two leaders had a frank exchange of
views.

86. EXT. SEASIDE. DAY

KANIA and BREZHNEV are now in beach clothes,
wearing sunglasses, straw hats and so on. A nervous

WAITER is hovering with a tray of brightly coloured
drinks.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The July Congress of the Polish United

Workers’ Party was over. It had been the first ever
Communist Party Congress to be composed of freely
elected delegates – 2,000 of them, mostly there for the
first time. They started by voting in a Central Committee
which swept aside seven-eighths of the old guard,
including four Politburo members. Kania, the great
reformer, was re-elected First Secretary. Even so, the
Congress knew that Poland was on the horns of a dilemma,
and both horns made a showing in the Politburo. The hard-
liner, Olszowski, made it to the top again.

BREZHNEV: Why did they keep Olszowski?

KANIA: He is respected for his economic ideas.

BREZHNEV: Why?

KANIA: Because Gierek sacked him.

BREZHNEV: And Jaruzelski?

KANIA: The Prime Minister is respected by all sides.

(Suddenly irritated by the WAITER, BREZHNEV knocks the tray
of drinks out of his hand.)

BREZHNEV: (Shouts) Respect! (Jabs a finger at KANIA.) Do you

know how you got into this mess?

KANIA: Comrade First Secretary, we must have strayed from

the Leninist path …

BREZHNEV: You got into this mess by getting into debt to

capitalist bankers!

87. INT. THE BANKERS’ MEETING. DAY

The set-up is much the same as the first bankers’
meeting (scene 19).
FINANSKY is in the chair.

FINANSKY: This is very harsh.

AMERICAN BANKER: I’m sorry but last March you had the

unhappy distinction of being the first Communist country
to request a rescheduling of its debts.

FINANSKY: We know what to do. Prices must increase two or

three times over. A loaf of bread should perhaps
quadruple. We know that. But you understand, we have

problems.

88. EXT. STEELWORKS. DAY

Top shot. Meeting of fifty workers being addressed
by a PARTY MAN.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The Government announced food price

increases of 123 per cent. There were daily disturbances,
At workers’ meetings when Party officials used the word –
(Close up on PARTY MAN addressing the meeting.)

PARTY MAN: Comrades!

(He is greeted by sustained whistles of derision from the
meeting.)

89. INT. SOLIDARITY MEETING HALL. DAY

RAKOWSKI is present with WALESA and a SOLIDARITY
TEAM, including the KATOWICE MAN and a MINER.

RAKOWSKI: The attitude of Solidarity is arrogant and offensive

You won’t get eggs if you don’t feed the chickens.
Production this year is down 18 per cent. Coal is down 14
per cent. Wages are up 20 per cent.

MINER: I’m a coal miner, Comrade Rakowski. Miners are going

to work hungry – how can you expect hungry men to raise
production?

KATOWICE MAN: We’re pouring steel to 40 per cent of capacity

The whole place is run inefficiently. We could double
output if we had workers’ self-management.

RAKOWSKI: For God’s sake – one thing at a time.

WALESA: We don’t have time. You’ve had time. It’s almost

exactly a year since we signed the arrangement in Gdansk.
We are cheated, lied to, misrepresented in the press and
on TV. We’ve given you time. Next week we’ll call a
printers’ strike. We’ll close down TV and radio if we don’t
get the access we were promised.

RAKOWSKI: Are we here to talk about bread or TV?

MINER: Bread?

RAKOWSKI: I have to tell you from September 1st a loaf costing

seven zlotys will cost seventeen zlotys. Flour will increase
somewhat less. It will double.

(The SOLIDARITY MEN look at each other silently and then get
up.)

WALESA: We are not a poor country. We are badly managed.

The question of workers’ councils to take charge of
production is now urgent.

MINER: (To WALESA) Gierek gave us those in ’71. They soon got

sucked under by the Party machine.

WALESA: In ’71 there was no Solidarity.

(WALESA and his COLLEAGUES turn and walk out of the
meeting hall.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) On September 4th, the Soviet Union

put 100‚000 men into military manoeuvres around Poland.
The following day the First National Congress of the Free
Independent Union Solidarity opened in a sports stadium
in Gdansk.

90. INT. SOLIDARITY CONGRESS. DAY

The cut is to a big close-up of WALESA addressing a
large gathering.

WALESA: … This Congress is the heritage of the blood of 1956,

of 1970, of 1976 and of all the struggles of the Polish
workers. The fight has only just begun but we shall win!
(WALESA acknowledges sustained applause.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The Congress called for free elections

to parliament, for union supervision of food production and
distribution, for public control of the mass media, for
workers’ self-management. Jan Rulewski called for …
(Mix to close-up on RULEWSKI.)

RULEWSKI: … deletion of the clause recognizing the leading

role of the Polish United Workers’ Party …
(There is a cut to WALESA listening. He shakes his head.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) There was worse to come.

91. INT. KANIA’S OFFICE. DAY

KANIA and JARUZELSKI are present. The intercom on
the desk starts to announce, His Excellency the
Soviet Ambassador, but the furious AMBASSADOR is in
the room waving a piece of paper before the

intercom has finished.

AMBASSADOR: I quote. ‘The delegates assembled in Gdansk

send greetings and expressions of support to workers of
Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic
Republic, Romania, Hungary and all nations of the Soviet
Union … we share the same destiny … despite the lies
disseminated in your countries … we support those of you
who embark on the struggle for a free union movement …’
I am ordered to make the strongest possible protest, on
behalf of the Government of the Soviet Union.

KANIA: Of course. Thank you. I agree it is most regrettable.

(The AMBASSADOR waits for more but there is a pause. In
the end the AMBASSADOR nods a farewell and leaves the
room. KANIA and JARUZELSKI look at each other. JARUZELSKI
begins to laugh quietly.)

JARUZELSKI: Albania …! (He finds this very funny.) … Albania

…!

92. INT. CAFE. NIGHJT

WITNESS and NARRATOR.

WITNESS: It’s not really funny. It’s probably the end.

NARRATOR: No, they’re still talking.

(To camera) During all this, the Government offered
Solidarity 
a 
formula 
for 
workers’ 
self-management.

Evidently, they were still Poles talking to Poles.

WITNESS: Jaruzelski did his officer training in the Soviet

Union.

NARRATOR: (To camera) During all this, the Government

offered Solidarity a formula for workers’ management.
Evidently, the Party was playing cat and mouse with the
union.

93. INT. MOVING FIAT CAR. NIGHT

WALESA is driving. RULEWSKI is next to him. Two
SOLIDARITY MEMBERS sit in the back.

WALESA: (To RULEWSKI) Jan, stick to Poland. Let the Albanians

and the Hungarians and the Bulgarians look after
themselves. I’m surprised Rakowski is still talking to us.

How are the others getting there?

RULEWSKI: It’s just us four.

WALESA: That’s just how I like it. A praesidium that can fit into

a Fiat.

94. INT. SOLIDARITY CONGRESS. DAY

JURCZYK is addressing a large audience.

JURCZYK: I move that we reprimand Lech Walesa and his

Praesidium colleagues for the undemocratic way in which
they reached this decision on workers’ self-management.
Four men voted three to one, and they presumed to
overturn a resolution made by 900 of us in this hall!

WALESA: (In close-up – shouting) We could have come back

empty-handed! But we didn’t, we made a decision. It takes
no guts at all to stand up here and complain about the
world.

95. INT. OFFICE (SOLIDARITY CONGRESS). DAY

WALESA lies exhausted across three chairs. RULEWSKI
walks across and looks down at him.

RULEWSKI: I’m standing against you for the leadership.

WALESA: You’re making a mistake, Jan.

RULEWSKI: Why? Do you think you’re indispensable?

WALESA: No. But Marian Jurczyk is already standing against

me. You’ll split the vote.

RULEWSKI: Gwiazda is standing, too.

WALESA: The three of you. All or nothing. Now or never. I’ve

been trying to tell you for a year. That’s how to lose.
(WALESA puts his head back and closes his eyes. RULEWSKI
watches him for a moment and then turns and leaves. The
office furniture, television sets etc. are being cleared away
around WALESA. Bulletin boards are being taken off the
walls. Files are being stacked. WALESA sleeps on.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Walesa won with 55 per cent of the

vote. Marian Jurczyk polled 24 per cent, Andrzej Gwiazda
9 per cent, and Jan Rulewski 6 per cent. The delegates left
the floor of the rented sports hall, which was then flooded
and frozen over for a hockey game.

96. INT. A DRESSING ROOM. DAY

In fact we could be anywhere because the scene is of
crisp separate close-ups on a man (JARUZELSKI)
pulling on a military uniform, the belt, the hat, etc.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Talks began again between Solidarity

and the Government. The union gave the Government ten
days to produce results or face a national strike. Within a
week there was a result of sorts.
(The last article to be donned is the pair of tinted glasses
worn by JARUZELSKI.)

97. INT. FIRST SECRETARY’S OFFICE. DAY

A SECRETARY (a man) is arranging files on the
otherwise empty desk. JARUZELSKI walks into the
room.

SECRETARY: Good morning, Comrade First Secretary.

Everything is ready for you.

JARUZELSKI: Thank you.

(JARUZELSKI goes to sit behind the desk.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) For the first time in a Communist

country one man was head of the Party, the government
and the army. It was the first Communist Party anywhere
to be led by a general.
(JARUZELSKI sits down, looks around, pleased, and gives his
uniform a little flick.)

JARUZELSKI: You don’t think the effect is … a bit South

American?

The General

98. EXT. PARADE GROUND. DAY

The cut is to a close-up of GENERAL JARUZELSKI.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) Back in August, the General said …

JARUZELSKI: (Declaiming) 
How 
long 
can 
the 
patience,

moderation and good will of the republic be put to the
test? Polish soldiers have the right to say: enough of this
indulgence!
(We cut to the GENERAL reviewing a line of YOUNG OFFICERS.)

NARRATOR: The fact that he was speaking to a passing-out

parade of young officers at the time made it less startling
than it might have been … but nowadays there were
generals in more and more government posts – education,
money, transport, even a general in charge of the Polish
airline. The only thing missing was the appointment of the
Chief of the General Staff to the Politburo, and that came
at the end of October.

99. INT. WALESA FLAT. EVENING

WALESA and his wife DANUTA and six CHILDREN are
eating at a table big enough for them and two
guests, KURON and GWIAZDA. DANUTA is pregnant.

KURON: I think political rule in Poland is already a sort of

fiction. The army is starting to run things. Political power
is lying in the gutter for somebody to pick up. Maybe the
people nearest the gutter have the best chance – the
Stalinists who call it socialism, the anti-Semites who call it
nationalism … You have no chance at all. If you were
handed power on a plate you’d be left fighting over the
plate. I thought a workers’ protest movement could lead to
a truly socialist Poland. It required discipline and stability.
It required solidarity. The union executive is being pulled
around like a tin can tied to a dog’s tail.

GWIAZDA: We deserve it. The workers are activists, we’re a

bureaucracy.

WALESA: How else are we supposed to negotiate for them?

GWIAZDA: We negotiate, they fight.

WALESA: That’s surrender. Not to the Government, to chaos.

I’m going to propose a national warning strike so that at
least for an hour we look like an organization again.

GWIAZDA: (Exploding) Jesus Christ! In Katowice there were

5,000 fighting the police with stones! Students took over
the radio station! And you want to stop work for lunch!
(It has become a loud row.)
I don’t want 5,000 people throwing stones somewhere at
the other end of the country. It produces nothing except an
opportunity for the generals, who can’t wait to save the
nation. (To KURON) I’m right, aren’t I?
(KURON gets up.)

KURON: I’m going back to Warsaw. We have to start again.

WALESA: A new party?

KURON: No. A reappraisal.

GWIAZDA: A discussion group. Maybe you can write another

open letter.

KURON: (Losing his temper, too) The Communist Manifesto

was an open letter! The written word – I believe in it.
When this tower of Babel collapses upon itself you’ll need
to be reminded what the noise was all about.
(This takes him to the door.)
(More quietly) You failed because you had no reliable
framework for your actions. If you want freedom of action
in a Communist state the strategy will have to be thought
out better than this. Maybe it will have to be the
intellectuals after all. Next time, eh?
(KURON leaves. After a pause WALESA also gets up from the
table and leaves, into another room, closing the door.)

GWIAZDA: (To DANUTA) I’m going.

(DANUTA nods.)
Thank you. (GWIAZDA leaves the flat.)

100. EXT. PLAYGROUND. DAY

The NARRATOR is there watching several of the
WALESA CHILDREN playing with a ball.

FIRST CHILD: Poor Mr Kuron …

SECOND CHILD: He thinks if he leaves the Party alone …

THIRD CHILD: … the Party will leave him alone.

FIRST CHILD: Poor Mr Kuron.

WITNESS: (Voice over) A cheap trick, in my opinion … Out of

the mouths of children …

101. INT. CAFE

The 
NARRATOR and the 
WITNESS are drinking

together. The WITNESS is still speaking.

WITNESS: … Why didn’t you give them a puppy to make sure?

NARRATOR: Do the Walesas have a dog?

WITNESS: It’s a little late to be scrupulous about detail.

NARRATOR: What’s the answer to Kuron?

WITNESS: I know Kuron. In 1800 he was in nostalgic exile in

Paris waiting for history to put the clock back. In 1900 he
was a revolutionary Marxist in London waiting for the
proletariat to put the clock forward. Now he’s in People’s
Poland and it seems to be neither one thing nor the other,
an independent slave-state ruled by worker-princes. No
wonder he’s disappointed.

NARRATOR: Well, then what …?

WITNESS: He’s got it upside down, in my opinion. Theories

don’t guarantee social justice, social justice tells you if a
theory is any good. Right and wrong are not complicated –
when a child cries, ‘That’s not fair!’ the child can be
believed. Children are always right. But it was still a cheap
trick.

NARRATOR: I’ll take it back.

102. INT. WALESA FLAT. EVENING

As before. The scene has got to the point where
KURON is at the door, about to leave.

KURON: Next time, eh? (To WALESA) I think your plan is good.

Get the best deal you can for the working man. You’re a
union, after all.

103. INT. STEELWORKS. DAY

WALESA is in the foreground. Low camera angle.
WORKERS are in the gantry above. The factory is loud
and busy.
WALESA looks at his watch. At that moment the sirens
sound.

104. INT. OPERATIONS ROOM. DAY

There is a map table and maps and city plans on the
walls. Half a dozen high-ranking MILITARY OFFICERS
are crowded round the table.
JARUZELSKI is among them, using a pointer to
indicate different parts of the map. The siren sound
overlaps with diminished volume, into this room. The
ARMY OFFICERS all pause and look up, listening …

105. INT. STEELWORKS. DAY

WALESA is where he was. The siren is just finishing.
The machinery is coming to a halt. So are the men
who were working.

WALESA: It’s music to them … music …

106. INT. PARLIAMENT. DAY

JARUZELSKI is at the microphone.

JARUZELSKI: In the Central Committee, even in the Politburo,

there are voices asking us to set our democratic system
aside until peace is restored. What I will ask of this
assembly is to prepare itself for a situation where I will
have to come to you and ask for emergency laws. There
are 12,000 on strike in the textile mills. If the independent
union cannot control its anarchists, we will have to find
some other way …

107. INT. GOVERNMENT MEETING ROOM. DAY

On one side of the large table is RAKOWSKI, flanked

by two ADVISERS. He is faced by WALESA, similarly
attended.

WALESA: I was in the textile mills. I have met these anarchists

… 12,000 women, young girls and grannies, working wives
… Do you think they’re on strike because they want to
overthrow the Party? No, they’re on strike because work
brings no reward, and it doesn’t look as if the Government
knows what to do about it. They get up in the dark to stand
in line for hours to buy a pair of shoes the wrong size so
that they may have something to barter for a piece of meat
– which turns out to be rotten. They appeal to you, and you
say – oh, we can’t help it, these anarchists are making life
impossible. And then it turns out they’re the anarchists!
Listen, they can’t break the circle, someone else has to. I
don’t think you can do it on your own.

RAKOWSKI: I agree. You know our proposal – an action front

representing all the social forces – the Government,
Solidarity, the Church, the peasants, the official unions,
Catholic intellectuals, economists, scientists – a team of
national unity –

WALESA: You just want to water us down. But we’re 10 million

and we won’t sit down as equal partners with the
incompetents and hacks – the central planners, the time-
servers, the seat warmers – all the ones who had the
chance and lost it. You’ve failed, and the best answer now
is an economic council, independent, with real power,
made up of Solidarity and Government equally with equal
voices.

RAKOWSKI: (Angrily) What sort of government do you expect to

hand over its authority to a committee?

WALESA: Your sort. A government with no mandate at the end

of its string.
(RAKOWSKI, insulted, gets up from the table and walks away,
perhaps towards a window. His ADVISERS look stonily across
the table, WALESA and the SOLIDARITY MEN stand up and
prepare to leave.)

RAKOWSKI: Perhaps you’d like to tell that to the General?

WALESA: (With conscious irony) Do you mean the Prime

Minister?

RAKOWSKI: Yes, the Prime Minister. The First Secretary. The

General.

WALESA: How many votes does he get?

108. INT. POLITBURO VESTIBULE. DAY

The SOLIDARITY TEAM is leaving. RAKOWSKI appears.

RAKOWSKI: Comrade Walesa –

(WALESA drops back. RAKOWSKI takes him aside. He speaks
quietly.)
General Jaruzelski is interested in a new initiative. With
Archbishop Glemp. Will you meet them?

WALESA: Just the three of us?

RAKOWSKI: Just the three of you.

109. INT. SOLIDARITY MEETING ROOM (GDANSK) DAY

There are four men in the room … WALESA, GWIAZDA,
RULEWSKI and JURCZYK. Because of the size of the
room, some of the conversation may be shouted
across the yards of space.

RULEWSKI: What do they want? Your autograph?

GWIAZDA: You had no authority to accept.

WALESA: Should we announce that we aren’t even willing to

talk to the Prime Minister and the Primate of Poland?

GWIAZDA: Not we, you. Why you?

WALESA: I was asked.

GWIAZDA: You were asked because you’re Jaruzelski’s meat.

You’re a babe in arms.

RULEWSKI: So is Glemp. The General wants the moral

authority of the Church and the social seal of approval of
Solidarity.

GWIAZDA: They’ll muzzle you.

WALESA: I’m going.

GWIAZDA: Lech, you’re a vain fool! Your moustache is famous

but there is nothing above it.

WALESA: (Over the top) You can throw me out any time you

like. I’ll go and I’ll take the union with me. I’ll dissolve it
inside two weeks!
(The others look at each other in astonishment.)

RULEWSKI: Where will you take it? To New York? In two weeks

you will be the guest of the American unions. Maybe you
should have taken the union with you when you went to
Geneva – to Japan – to Paris – to the Vatican.

JURCZYK: We don’t have to destroy ourselves, there’s others

willing to do it –

WALESA: Yes, that’s right, Marian – and one way to destroy us

is to go round making speeches calling the Government
traitors, Moscow’s servants, Jews – what did you mean by
it?

JURCZYK: I meant they’re traitors, Moscow’s servants and in

some cases Jews.

ourselves from such talk.

JURCZYK: Wait till you get to America. The Americans won’t

hear a word you say about your ideals for socialism –
they’ll make an anti-Russian carnival out of you.
(WALESA’s manner changes instantly as he takes this in.)

WALESA: That’s true. You’re right. I won’t go. The American

trip is off. As of now.
(The other three are astonished by him again.)

(Smiles.) That’s right. When somebody’s right they don’t.

have to argue with me. The right move and the wrong
move – I don’t need arguments. I can feel it – right and
wrong. The meeting feels right, and I’m going to it.

110. INT. GOVERNMENT GUEST HOUSE. EVENING

There is a green-baize card table and three chairs.
The NARRATOR is standing by, shuffling a pack of
cards.

NARRATOR: (To camera) Cardinal Wyszynski had died in May.

The new Primate of Poland was Archbishop Joseph Glemp.
The meeting which took place between the Primate, the
General and the union leader on November 4th 1981 was
without precedent, not just in the Polish crisis but in the
Communist world. It lasted 2 hours and 20 minutes.
(The NARRATOR starts to deal the cards three ways.)
That much is known. But as to who said what to whom …
(The WITNESS appears with a carafe and three glasses. He
puts them on the table.)

WITNESS: Don’t tell me, let me guess. Cards on the table.

NARRATOR: Playing one’s hand.

WITNESS: Writers.

111. INT. THE SAME. EVENING

There is the card table and the three chairs, with a
hand of cards waiting at each place. JARUZELSKI,
GLEMP and WALESA approach the table and sit down.
Each looks at his own cards. The three men play
cards as they speak. They pick up and put down
cards as it becomes their turn to speak. The cards
are seen to be not conventional. Their designs, in red
and white, show, variously, the Polish Eagle, a
Church symbol, the Solidarity symbol, the hammer
and sickle … but there is no attempt to make the
rules of the game precisely intelligible to the
audience. The impression is that the game is a form
of whist.

JARUZELSKI: We are Poles. There is much we can agree on.

GLEMP: Certainly we want to settle our own problems.

WALESA: All right.

JARUZELSKI: Thank you.

(JARUZELSKI picks up the three cards as a ‘trick’. He puts
down a card.)
The Russians are reluctant to intervene but at a certain
point they would have to overcome their reluctance. That
point will be reached when socialism breaks down in this
country.

GLEMP: I agree.

WALESA: We can’t even agree on language. What is this

socialism you’re talking about? Solidarity is socialism.

JARUZELSKI: It is not Lenin’s socialism.

GLEMP: Let us say that Solidarity is socialism. But is it not

breaking down? Socialism is order. (To WALESA) Your
extremists create disorder.

WALESA: (Upset) Father, the Government is trying to make

accomplices of us by holding these Russians over our
heads – ‘Behave yourselves for Poland’s sake!’ Why should

we believe it? I don’t think the Russians can afford to
intervene.

JARUZELSKI: They can never afford to until they can’t afford not

to.
(He picks up the second ‘trick’.)
The Polish Church is unique, a stronghold of Christianity
in the Communist world. Soviet intervention would change
many things.

GLEMP: Not just for the Church. It would certainly be the end

of the free trade unions.

WALESA: The Russian scare shouldn’t change what we think or

do. That’s blackmail and it’s not moral to give in to it. We
can afford to be wrong but the Church has got to be right.
(WALESA stands up abruptly, throwing down his cards. The
picture freezes.)

NARRATOR: (Voice over) But there was no fly on the wall. No

one knows how little help Walesa got from Archbishop
Glemp. Or how much.
(The scene cuts back to the beginning, the game
beginning again.)

JARUZELSKI: We are Poles. There is much we can agree on.

GLEMP: Certainly we want to settle our own problems.

WALESA: All right.

JARUZELSKI: Thank you.

(JARUZELSKI picks up the ‘trick’.)
The Russians are reluctant to intervene but they would
have to overcome their reluctance if socialism breaks
down in this country.

GLEMP: (Turning on JARUZELSKI) We can’t even agree on

language. What is this intervention? It is invasion and
occupation to rescue a discredited dictatorship!

WALESA: (Cautiously) But invasion would change many things,

not just for the union. The Polish Church has a unique
position and it has been won at great sacrifice.

JARUZELSKI: The dictatorship of the proletariat as expressed

through the Party is the only government we’ve got and
Solidarity is not letting it govern.

GLEMP: (Again attacking JARUZELSKI) The Government has

reneged on most of the provisions of the Gdansk
Agreement. The conflict is of your creation because you

deny the rights of the citizen!
(The picture freezes again.)

and the pictures. It wasn’t a card game.
(The scene cuts back to the beginning but now it is not a
card game. The table is polished wood.)
But time was running out. There were to be elections in
February and the one problem a Communist government
cannot afford is to get re-elected.

JARUZELSKI: We have elections in February. (To WALESA) You

proclaimed a trade union with no interest in politics. In the
last few months, thirty-five anti-socialist groups posing as
political parties have been formed. We all have reason to
fear the consequences. The Russians are reluctant to
intervene but at a certain point they will have to overcome
their reluctance.

GLEMP: Poland’s socialist dictatorship is the most democratic

government we’ve got, and the most Polish. We are here to
decide how we can best help it clothe and feed the
population. Am I wrong? Without the economic problem
there would be no political problem. Without the political
problem there would be no Russian problem.

WALESA: No, you’re not wrong.

JARUZELSKI: We have coal reserves for two more weeks. How

do I get the country running again? (To WALESA) I’ve asked
you to ban wildcat strikes. I’ve offered to sit down with you
in a council for national renewal.

WALESA: With us and enough others to give you a tame

majority.

GLEMP: What if Solidarity had a veto?

JARUZELSKI: No. But perhaps if every member had the right of

veto …

WALESA: No.

JARUZELSKI: Then just Solidarity and the Government.

GLEMP: And the Church.

JARUZELSKI: That’s possible. (To WALESA) What do you say?

(Pause.)

WALESA: There’s a meeting tonight of the Solidarity National

Commission, I have to go back to Gdansk.

112. INT. SOLIDARITY NATIONAL COMMISSION. NIGHT

The meeting is noisy. The familiar faces are there.
GWIAZDA is in the chair. WALESA (dressed as for the
Glemp/Jaruzelski meeting) appears.
GWIAZDA sees him.

GWIAZDA: Lech!

(The meeting goes quiet.)
We didn’t wait. We’ve made some progress.

WALESA: I’ve got something to put to the vote.

GWIAZDA: We already voted. A national strike in three months

if the Government doesn’t satisfy conditions.

WALESA: And a ban on unofficial strikes?

GWIAZDA: We voted on that too. No ban.

WALESA: Is that your idea of progress?

GWIAZDA: Yes. It is.

(WALESA approaches him.)

WALESA: You’re sitting in my chair.

(GWIAZDA vacates the chair, WALESA takes it. He picks up the
microphone in front of him.)
If it’s confrontation you want, that’s fine because that’s
what you’re voting for. You might as well leave now and
start prising up the cobbles off the streets.
(The meeting goes quiet for him.)
I’m here with a new formula for talking with the
Government – a national committee of –
(The meeting starts murmuring against him.)
Yes, I know. They lie. They cheat. They kick and bite and
scratch before they give an inch – but that’s how we got
this union, inch by inch across the negotiating table!
(The meeting starts to applaud, a slow build interrupted
by GWIAZDA.)

GWIAZDA: (Shouting) We got it by going on strike and staying

on strike.

WALESA: You’re wrong. We got it because we could deliver a

return to work. We’ve got nothing else to negotiate with,
and if we can’t deliver, what have they got to lose?
(The applause grows.)

GWIAZDA: They’ve conned you, Lech! The talks are a sham.

Across the table is where they want us – all the time we’re

talking they’re getting ready to hit us. You keep the chair
I’m not going to be needing it.

GWIAZDA leaves and from different places about a dozen
men. ones who were not clapping, leave with him.)

113. INT. PLAYGROUND (GDANSK). DAY

WALESA and his WIFE and CHILDREN are in the
playground. The CHILDREN are running around at
some distance and playing.
(DANUTA is pregnant.)

WALESA: Andrzej’s resigned. Him and others. They say my line

is too soft. Maybe it is. I read in the papers that Walesa is a
moderate and Gwiazda is a radical and I feel a sort of
shame. How brave it sounds, to be a radical.

DANUTA: You’re radical enough. Solidarity is losing its halo,

Lech. The TV makes you look like saboteurs. You’re getting
blamed for the shortages, for the farmers’ strikes, the
student strikes, the taxi drivers’ strike … for everything.
People are saying the government can’t solve it, Solidarity
can’t solve it, there’s only the army left, and better ours
than theirs.

WALESA: What people?

DANUTA: Ordinary people. You know. Not the Praesidium. Not

the Government. People.

WALESA: I wish I could talk to Jacek.

DANUTA: Why can’t you?

114. INT. POLICE CELL. DAY

The WITNESS, the worse for wear, is flung into the
cell. KURON is lying on a bunk in the cell.

WITNESS: Where did they get you?

KURON: At home.

WITNESS: What for?

KURON: Attempting to overthrow the state. I think. What’s

happening outside?

WITNESS: The fire brigade cadets have taken over the college.

KURON: Strikers in uniform? Well, we’re getting there.

115. INT. OPERATIONS ROOM. DAY

JARUZELSKI has a visitor – MARSHAL KULIKOV.

JARUZELSKI: We’re getting there. The Western bankers have

given us an ultimatum, the zloty is being devalued, and
parliament won’t pass a strike law. I would say … about a
week. Tomorrow we move in against the fire brigade
cadets.

KULIKOV: Troops?

JARUZELSKI: (Shaking his head) Not yet. Riot police. We’ll use

helicopters to secure the roof and go in through the main
gate.

116. EXT. STREET

There is a lot of noise. There is a helicopter noise
overhead. WALESA is there looking up. He is joined by
a furious and triumphant GWIAZDA.

GWIAZDA: And you’re still talking to them about workers’ self-

management! It’s confrontation, Lech.

WALESA: Yes. I know.

117. INT. SOLIDARITY MEETING ROOM. DAY

This is a meeting of about twenty people, the
Praesidium and Regional Chairmen of Solidarity.
WALESA is speaking.

WALESA: Confrontation was always at the end of the road. I

hoped to get there by easy stages. I think we could have
got further, but I miscalculated. So we have to change our
tactics and be prepared to move at lightning speed.

BUJAK: We’ll liberate the radio and TV … we’ll establish our

own council for the national economy. It will be like a
provisional government.

118. INT. JARUZELSKL’S OFFICE. DAY

JARUZELSKI is listening to a tape of Bujak’s speech.

BUJAK: (On tape) … we’ll establish our own council for the

national economy. It will be like a provisional government.

JARUZELSKI: We’re there.

(We see that he is talking to MARSHAL KULIKOV.)

KULIKOV: None too soon. This trap has been a long time

springing.

regrettable outcome.

KULIKOV: We all forgive you, Wojciech.

119. INT. WALSEA BEDROOM. NIGHT

DANUTA is in bed. WALESA enters without putting on
the light. He sits on the bed and starts taking his
shoes off.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) The final meeting of the National

Commission of Solidarity ended in Gdansk on Saturday
night, December 12th. There was going to be a national
day of protest, a general strike against strike laws, and,
going all the way now, a reappraisal of the Soviet
connection.

DANUTA: Remember once they arrested you when I was nearly

giving birth? Which baby was that?

WALESA: Yes, I remember. Everything was simpler then. We

didn’t fight amongst ourselves. There was only one way to
go. Then round the corner there was a fork in the road,
and each fork led to a fork … so we got separated. Well,
it’s been sixteen months. We’ve gone further and quicker
than anyone expected. Jacek said we could win little by
little, or lose overnight.

DANUTA: Lech …?

WALESA: They’ve cut the phone lines from Gdansk. I’m sorry.

We may be apart for a while.

DANUTA: You don’t know that. Lech …?

WALESA: I think I’ve always known.

120. INT. POLICE CELL. DAY

The WITNESS is asleep. KURON apparently doesn’t
know it, for he is pacing the cell, talking angrily.

KURON: It was not a conflict between ideologists – trying to

make one system fit with another. (Scornfully) Marxist-

Leninism! – what would Lenin have thought of the Polish
Church? Or Polish agriculture – 80 per cent privately
owned. Ideology is as dead as Lenin. All Brezhnev
demanded from us was a political guarantee of the military
alliance, and reliable railways for the army. All the rest is
self-delusion.

121. INT. AIRFIELD. NIGHT

There is a parked helicopter with its rotors spinning.
WALESA is escorted into the helicopter, which then
takes flight.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) By dawn on Sunday, December 13th

almost the entire Solidarity leadership was under arrest.
The military council which announced itself as Poland’s
saviour also arrested the former First Secretary, Edward
Gierek, together with five others who had helped him to
bring the Party and the country to the point in August
1980 when the shipyard workers on the Baltic Coast went
on strike and demanded the right to form a free and
independent trade union.

122. EXT. SEA SHORE. DAY

The beach and sea again. Everything is the same
except that JARUZELSKI has replaced KANIA.

NARRATOR: (Voice over) When the summer came, Wojciech

Jaruzelski, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers’
Party, left Warsaw for his holiday in the Soviet Union by
the Black Sea. There he met Leonid Brezhnev, First
Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
(BREZHNEV approaches, and the two men come together
andembrace.)
In an atmosphere of cordiality and complete mutual
understanding the two leaders had a frank exchange of
views.

BREZHNEV: Greetings, Comrade!

JARUZELSKI: Greetings, Comrade First Secretary!

BREZHNEV: So, how’s tricks?

JARUZELSKI: Fine.

BREZHNEV: And Mrs Jaruzelski?

JARUZELSKI: Who? – Oh, fine. And you?

BREZHNEV: To tell you the truth, I haven’t been feeling too

well.
(They walk together up the beach.)
