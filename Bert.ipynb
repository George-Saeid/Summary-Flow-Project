M. Miller, Sr., Messrs. Don \\n\\nCongdon, Anthony Boucher, and Alan Williams, to Dr. \\n\\nMarshal Taxay, the Reverend Alvin Burggraff, C.S.P., to Ss \\n\\nFrancis and Clare, and to Mary, for reasons known to each \\n\\nof them. \\n\\nEnd of Acknowledgement \\n\\nPart I Fiat Homo  \\n\\nChapter One  \\n\\nBrother Francis Gerard of Utah might never have  \\n\\ndiscovered the blessed documents, had it not been for the \\n\\npilgrim with girded loins who appeared during that young \\n\\nnovice\\'s Lenten fast in the desert. \\n\\nNever before had Brother Francis actually seen a pilgrim \\n\\nwith girded loins, but that this one was the bona fide \\n\\narticle he was convinced as soon as he had recovered from \\n\\nthe spine-chilling effect of the pilgrim\\'s advent on the far \\n\\nhorizon, as a wiggling iota of black caught in a shimmering \\n\\nhaze of heat. Legless, but wearing a tiny head, the iota \\n\\nmaterialized out of the mirror glaze on the broken roadway \\n\\nand seemed more to writhe than to walk into view, causing \\n\\nBrother Francis to clutch at the crucifix of his rosary and \\n\\nmutter an Ave or two. The iota suggested a tiny apparition \\n\\nspawned by the heat demons who tortured the land at \\n\\nhigh noon, when any creature capable of motion on the \\n\\ndesert (except the buzzards and a few monastic hermits \\n\\nsuch as Francis) lay motionless in its burrow or hid \\n\\nbeneath a rock from the ferocity of the sun. Only a thing \\n\\nmonstrous, a thing preternatural, or a thing with addled \\n\\nwits would hike purposefully down the trail at noon this \\n\\nway. \\n\\nBrother Francis added a hasty prayer to Saint Raul the \\n\\nCyclopean, patron of the misborn, for protection against \\n\\nthe Saint\\'s unhappy proteges. (For who did not then know \\n\\nwhich was born alive was, by the law of the Church and \\n\\nthe law of Nature, suffered to live, and helped to maturity \\n\\nif possible, by those who had begotten it. The law was not \\n\\nalways obeyed, but it was obeyed with sufficient frequency \\n\\nto sustain a scattered population of adult monsters, who \\n\\noften chose the remotest of deserted lands for their \\n\\nof prairie travelers.) But at last the iota squirmed its way \\n\\nout of the heat risers and into clear air, where it manifestly \\n\\nbecame a distant pilgrim; Brother Francis released the \\n\\ncrucifix with a small Amen. \\n\\nThe pilgrim was a spindly old fellow with a staff, a basket \\n\\nhat, a brushy beard, and a waterskin slung over one \\n\\nshoulder. He was chewing and spitting with too much \\n\\nrelish to be an apparition, and he seemed too frail and \\n\\nlame to be a successful practitioner of ogre-ism or \\n\\nhighwaymanship. Nevertheless, Francis slunk quietly out of \\n\\nnibbled stone where he could watch without being seen. \\n\\nwere occasions of mutual suspicion, and marked by initial \\n\\npreparations on both sides for an incident that might prove \\n\\neither cordial or warlike. \\n\\nSeldom more than thrice annually did any layman or \\n\\nstranger travel the old road that passed the abbey, in spite \\n\\nof the oasis which permitted that abbey\\'s existence and \\n\\nwhich would have made the monastery a natural inn for \\n\\nwayfarers if the road were not a road from nowhere, \\n\\nleading nowhere, in terms of the modes of travel in those \\n\\ntimes. Perhaps, in earlier ages, the road had been a \\n\\nportion of the shortest route from the Great Salt Lake to \\n\\nOld El Paso; south of the abbey it intersected a similar \\n\\nstrip of broken stone that stretched east- and westward. \\n\\nThe crossing was worn by time, but not by Man, of late. \\n\\nThe pilgrim approached within hailing distance, but the \\n\\nnovice stayed behind his mound of rubble. The pilgrim\\'s \\n\\nloins were truly girded with a piece of dirty burlap, his only \\n\\nclothing except for hat and sandals. Doggedly he plodded \\n\\nahead with a mechanical limp while assisting his crippled \\n\\nleg with the heavy staff. His rhythmic gait was that of a \\n\\nman with a long road behind him and a long way yet to go. \\n\\nBut, upon entering the area of the ancient ruins, he broke \\n\\nhis stride and paused to reconnoiter. \\n\\nFrancis ducked low. \\n\\nThere was no shade amid the cluster of mounds where a \\n\\ngroup of age-old buildings once had been, but some of the \\n\\nlarger stones could, nevertheless, provide cooling \\n\\nrefreshment to select portions of the anatomy for travelers \\n\\nas wise in the way of the desert as the pilgrim soon proved \\n\\nhimself to be. He searched briefly for a rock of suitable \\n\\nproportions. Approvingly, Brother Francis noted that he did \\n\\nsafe distance from it and, using his staff as a lever and a \\n\\nsmaller rock for a fulcrum, he jostled the weightier one \\n\\nuntil the inevitable buzzing creature crawled forth from \\n\\nbelow. Dispassionately the traveler killed the snake with \\n\\nhis staff and flipped the stillwriggling carcass aside. Having \\n\\ndispatched the occupant of the cool cranny beneath the \\n\\nstone, the pilgrim availed himself of the cool cranny\\'s \\n\\nceiling by the usual method of overturning the stone. \\n\\nThereupon, he pulled up the back of his loincloth, sat with \\n\\nhis withered buttocks against the stone\\'s relatively chilly \\n\\nunderside, kicked off his sandals, and pressed the soles of \\n\\nhis feet against what had been the sandy floor of the cool \\n\\ncranny. Thus refreshed, he wiggled his toes, smiled \\n\\ntoothlessly and began to hum a tune. Soon he was singing \\n\\na kind of crooning chant in a dialect not known to the \\n\\nnovice. Weary of crouching, Brother Francis shifted \\n\\nrestlessly. \\n\\nWhile he sang, the pilgrim unwrapped a biscuit and a bit of \\n\\ncheese. Then his singing paused, and he stood for a \\n\\nmoment to cry out softly in the vernacular of the region: \\n\\n\"Blest be Adonoi Elohim, King of All, who maketh bread to \\n\\nspring forth from the earth,\" in a sort of nasal bleat. The \\n\\nbleat being finished, he sat again, and commenced eating. \\n\\nThe wanderer had come a long way indeed, thought \\n\\nBrother Francis, who knew of no adjacent realm governed \\n\\nby a monarch with such an unfamiliar name and such \\n\\nstrange pretensions. The old man was making a penitential \\n\\npilgrimage, hazarded Brother Francis– perhaps to the \\n\\n\"shrine\" at the abbey, although the \"shrine\" was not yet \\n\\nofficially a shrine, nor was its \"saint\" yet officially a saint. \\n\\nBrother Francis could think of no alternate explanation of \\n\\nthe presence of an old wanderer on this road leading to \\n\\nnowhere. \\n\\nand the novice grew increasingly restless as his own \\n\\nanxiety waned. The rule of silence for the Lenten fast days \\n\\ndid not permit him to converse voluntarily with the old \\n\\nman, but if he left his hiding place behind the rubble heap \\n\\nbefore the old man departed, he was certain to be seen or \\n\\nheard by the pilgrim, for he had been forbidden to leave \\n\\nthe vicinity of his hermitage before the end of Lent. \\n\\nStill slightly hesitant, Brother Francis loudly cleared his \\n\\nthroat, then straightened into view. \\n\\n\"Whup!\" \\n\\nThe pilgrim\\'s bread and cheese went flying. The old man \\n\\ngrabbed his staff and bounded to his feet. \\n\\n\"Creep up on me, will you!\" \\n\\nHe brandished the staff menacingly at the hooded figure \\n\\nwhich had arisen from beyond the rock pile. Brother \\n\\nFrancis noticed that the thick end of the staff was armed \\n\\nwith a spike. The novice bowed courteously, thrice, but the \\n\\npilgrim overlooked this nicety. \\n\\n\"Stay back there now!\" he croaked. \"Just keep your \\n\\ndistance, sport. I\\'ve got nothing you\\'re after– unless it\\'s \\n\\nI\\'m nothing but gristle, but I\\'ll fight to keep it. Back now! \\n\\nback!\" \\n\\n\"Wait– \" The novice paused. Charity, or even common \\n\\ncourtesy, could take precedence over the Lenten rule of \\n\\nsilence, when circumstances demanded speech, but to \\n\\nbreak silence on his own decision always left him slightly \\n\\nnervous. \\n\\n\"I\\'m not a sport, good simpleton,\" he continued, using the \\n\\npolite address. He tossed back his hood to show his \\n\\nmonastic haircut and held up his rosary beads. \"Do you \\n\\nunderstand these?\" \\n\\nFor several seconds the old man remained in catlike \\n\\nreadiness for combat while he studied the novice\\'s \\n\\nsun-blistered, adolescent face. The pilgrim\\'s had been a \\n\\nnatural mistake. Grotesque creatures who prowled the \\n\\nfringes of the desert often wore hoods, masks, or \\n\\nvoluminous robes to hide deformity. Among them were \\n\\nthose whose deformity was not limited to the body, those \\n\\nwho sometimes looked on travelers as a dependable \\n\\nsource of venison. \\n\\nAfter a brief scrutiny, the pilgrim straightened. \\n\\n\"Oh– one of them.\" He leaned on his staff and scowled. \"Is \\n\\nthat the Leibowitz Abbey down yonder?\" he asked, pointing \\n\\ntoward the distant cluster of buildings to the south. \\n\\nBrother Francis bowed politely and nodded at the ground. \\n\\n\"What are you doing out here in the ruins?\" \\n\\nThe novice picked up a chalklike fragment of stone. That \\n\\nthe traveler might be literate was statistically unlikely, but \\n\\nBrother Francis decided to try. Since the vulgar dialects of \\n\\nthe people had neither alphabet nor orthography, he \\n\\nchalked the Latin words for \"Penance, Solitude, and \\n\\nin ancient English, hoping, in spite of his unacknowledged \\n\\nyearning for someone to talk to, that the old man would \\n\\nunderstand and leave him to his lonely Lenten vigil. \\n\\nThe pilgrim smiled wryly at the inscription. His laugh \\n\\nseemed less a laugh than a fatalistic bleat. \"Hmmm-hnnn! \\n\\nStill writing things backward,\" he said; but if he \\n\\nunderstood the inscription, he did not condescend to admit \\n\\nit. He laid aside his staff, sat on the rock again, picked his \\n\\nbread and cheese out of the sand, and began scraping \\n\\nthem clean. Francis moistened his lips hungrily, but looked \\n\\naway. He had eaten nothing but cactus fruit and one \\n\\nhandful of parched corn since Ash Wednesday; the rules of \\n\\nfast and abstinence were rather strict for vocational vigils. \\n\\nNoticing his discomfort, the pilgrim broke his bread and \\n\\ncheese; he offered a portion to Brother Francis. \\n\\nIn spite of his dehydrated condition, caused by his meager \\n\\nwater supply, the novice\\'s mouth flooded with saliva. His \\n\\neyes refused to move from the hand that offered the food. \\n\\nThe universe contracted; at its exact geometric center \\n\\ndemon commanded the muscles of his left leg to move his \\n\\nleft foot half a yard forward. The demon then possessed \\n\\nhis right leg to move the right foot ahead of the left, and it \\n\\nsomehow forced his right pectorals and biceps to swing his \\n\\narm until his hand touched the hand of the pilgrim. His \\n\\nfingers felt the food; they seemed even to taste the food. \\n\\nAn involuntary shudder passed over his half-starved body. \\n\\nHe closed his eyes and saw the Lord Abbot glaring at him \\n\\nand brandishing a bullwhip. Whenever the novice tried to \\n\\nvisualize the Holy Trinity, the countenance of God the \\n\\nFather always became confused with the face of the abbot, \\n\\nwhich was normally, it seemed to Francis, very angry. \\n\\nBehind the abbot a bonfire raged, and from the midst of \\n\\nthe flames the eyes of the Blessed Martyr Leibowitz gazed \\n\\nin death-agony upon his fasting protege, caught in the act \\n\\nof reaching for cheese. \\n\\nThe novice shuddered again. \"Apage Satanas!\" he hissed \\n\\nas he danced back and dropped the food. Without warning, \\n\\nhe spattered the old man with holy water from a tiny phial \\n\\nsneaked from his sleeve. The pilgrim had become \\n\\nindistinguishable from the Archenemy, for a moment, in \\n\\nthe somewhat sun-dazed mind of the novice. \\n\\nThis surprise attack on the Powers of Darkness and \\n\\nTemptation produced no immediate supernatural results, \\n\\nbut the natural results seemed to appear ex opere operato. \\n\\nThe pilgrim-Beelzebub failed to explode into sulfurous \\n\\nsmoke, but he made gargling sounds, turned a bright \\n\\nshade of red, and lunged at Francis with a bloodcurdling \\n\\nyell. The novice kept tripping on his tunic as he fled from \\n\\nflailing of the pilgrim\\'s spiked staff, and he escaped \\n\\nwithout nail holes only because the pilgrim had forgotten \\n\\nhis sandals. The old man\\'s limping charge became a \\n\\nskippity hop. He seemed suddenly mindful of scorching \\n\\nrocks under his bare soles. He stopped and became \\n\\npreoccupied. When Brother Francis glanced over his \\n\\nshoulder, he gained the distinct impression that the \\n\\npilgrim\\'s retreat to his cool spot was being accomplished \\n\\nby the feat of hopping along on the tip of one great toe. \\n\\nAshamed of the odor of cheese that lingered on his \\n\\nfingertips, and repenting his irrational exorcism, the novice \\n\\nslunk back to his self-appointed labors in the old ruins, \\n\\nwhile the pilgrim cooled his feet and satisfied his wrath by \\n\\nflinging an occasional rock at the youth whenever the \\n\\nlatter moved into view among the rubble mounds. When \\n\\nhis arm at last grew weary, he flung more feints than \\n\\nstones, and merely grumbled over his bread and cheese \\n\\nwhen Francis ceased to dodge. \\n\\nThe novice was wandering to and fro throughout the ruins, \\n\\noccasionally staggering toward some focal point of his \\n\\nwork with a rock, the size of his own chest, locked in a \\n\\npainful embrace. The pilgrim watched him select a stone, \\n\\nestimate its dimensions in hand-spans, reject it, and \\n\\ncarefully select another, to be pried free from the rock jam \\n\\nof the rubble, to be hoisted by Francis and stumblingly \\n\\nhauled away. He dropped one stone after a few paces, \\n\\nand, suddenly sitting, placed his head between his knees in \\n\\nan apparent effort to avoid fainting. After panting awhile, \\n\\nhe arose again and finished by rolling the stone \\n\\nend-over-end toward its destination. He continued this \\n\\nactivity while the pilgrim, no longer glaring, began to gape. \\n\\nThe sun blazed its midday maledictions upon the parched \\n\\nland, laying its anathema on all moist things. Francis \\n\\nlabored on in spite of the heat. \\n\\nWhen the traveler had washed down the last of his sandy \\n\\nbread and cheese with a few squirts from his waterskin, he \\n\\nslipped feet into sandals, arose with a grunt, and hobbled \\n\\nthrough the ruins toward the site of the novice\\'s labors. \\n\\nNoticing the old man\\'s approach, Brother Francis scurried \\n\\nto a safe distance. Mockingly, the pilgrim brandished his \\n\\nspiked cudgel at him, but seemed more curious about the \\n\\nyouth\\'s masonry than he seemed eager for revenge. He \\n\\npaused to inspect the novice\\'s burrow. \\n\\nThere, near the east boundary of the ruins, Brother Francis \\n\\nhad dug a shallow trench, using a stick for a hoe and \\n\\nhands for a shovel. He had, on the first day of Lent, roofed \\n\\nit over with a heap of brush, and used the trench by night \\n\\nas refuge from the desert\\'s wolves. But as the days of his \\n\\nfasting grew in number, his presence had increased his \\n\\nspoor in the vicinity until the nocturnal lupine prowlers \\n\\nseemed unduly attracted to the area of the ruins and even \\n\\nscratched around his brush heap when the fire was gone. \\n\\nFrancis had first attempted to discourage their nightly \\n\\ndigging by increasing the thickness of the brush pile over \\n\\nhis trench, and by surrounding it with a ring of stones set \\n\\ntightly in a furrow. But on the previous night, something \\n\\nhad leaped to the top of his brush pile and howled while \\n\\nFrancis lay shivering below, whereupon he had determined \\n\\nto fortify the burrow, and, using the first ring of stones as \\n\\na foundation, had begun to build a wall. The wall tilted \\n\\ninward as it grew; but since the enclosure was roughly an \\n\\noval in shape, the stones in each new layer crowded \\n\\nagainst adjacent stones to prevent an inward collapse. \\n\\nBrother Francis now hoped that by a careful selection of \\n\\npebble-wedging, he would be able to complete a dome. \\n\\nAnd, a single span of unbuttressed arch, somehow defying \\n\\ngravity, stood there over the burrow as a token of this \\n\\nambition. Brother Francis yelped like a puppy when the \\n\\npilgrim rapped curiously at this arch with his staff. \\n\\nSolicitous for his abode, the novice had drawn nearer  \\n\\nyelp with a flourish of the cudgel and a bloodthirsty howl. \\n\\nBrother Francis promptly tripped on the hem of his tunic \\n\\nand sat down. The old man chuckled. \\n\\n\"Hmmm-hnnn! You\\'ll need a strange shape of a rock to fit \\n\\nthat gap,\" he said, and rattled his staff back and forth in a \\n\\nvacant space in the highest tier of stones. \\n\\nThe youth nodded and looked away. He continued to sit in \\n\\nthe sand, and, by silence and by his lowered gaze, he \\n\\nhoped to tell the old man that he was neither free to \\n\\nconverse nor free to accept willingly another\\'s presence in \\n\\na dry twig in the sand: Et ire nos inducas in... \\n\\n\"I\\'ve not offered to change these stones into bread for you \\n\\nyet, have I?\" the old traveler said crossly. \\n\\nBrother Francis glanced up quickly. So! the old man could \\n\\nread, and read Scripture, at that. Furthermore, his remark \\n\\nimplied that he had understood both the novice\\'s impulsive \\n\\nuse of holy water and his reason for being here as well. \\n\\nAware now that the pilgrim was teasing him, Brother \\n\\nFrancis lowered his eyes again and waited. \\n\\n\"Hmmm-hnnn! So you\\'re to be left alone, are you? Well, \\n\\nthen, I\\'d best be on my way. Tell me, will your brothers at \\n\\nthe abbey let an old man rest a bit in their shade?\" \\n\\nBrother Francis nodded. \"They\\'ll give you food and water \\n\\ntoo,\" he added softly, in charity. \\n\\nThe pilgrim chuckled. \"For that, I\\'ll find you a rock to fit \\n\\nthat gap before I go. God with you.\" \\n\\nBut you need not– The protest died unspoken. Brother \\n\\nFrancis watched him hobbling slowly away. The pilgrim \\n\\nwandered in and about among the rubble mounds. He \\n\\npaused occasionally to inspect a stone or pry at one with \\n\\nhis staff. His search would surely prove fruitless, the \\n\\nnovice thought, for it was a repetition of a search which \\n\\nthe youth himself had been making since mid-morning. He \\n\\nhad decided at last that it would be easier to remove and \\n\\nrebuild a section of the highest tier than to find a keystone \\n\\nthat approximated the hourglass shape of the gap in that \\n\\ntier. But, surely, the pilgrim would soon exhaust his \\n\\npatience and wander on his way. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Brother Francis rested. He prayed for the \\n\\nrecovery of that inward privacy which the purpose of his \\n\\nvigil demanded that he seek: a clean parchment of the \\n\\nspirit whereon the words of a summons might be written in \\n\\nwas God stretched forth Its hand to touch his own tiny \\n\\nhuman loneliness and to mark his vocation there. The Little \\n\\nBook, which Prior Cheroki had left with him on the \\n\\npreceding Sunday, served as a guide to his meditation. It \\n\\nwas centuries old, and it was called Libellus Leibowitz, \\n\\nalthough only an uncertain tradition attributed its \\n\\nauthorship to the Beatus himself. \\n\\n\"Parum equidem te diligebam, Domine, juventute mea; \\n\\nquare doleo nimis . . . Too little, O Lord, did I love Thee in \\n\\nthe time of my youth; wherefore I grieve exceedingly in \\n\\nthe time of my age. In vain did I flee from Thee in those \\n\\ndays. . . \\n\\n\"Hoy! Over here!\" came a shout from beyond the rubble \\n\\nmounds. \\n\\nBrother Francis glanced up briefly, but the pilgrim was not \\n\\nin sight. His eyes fell again to the page. \\n\\n\"Repugnans tibi, ausus sum quaerere quid quid doctius \\n\\nmihi fide, certius spe, aut dulcius caritate visum esset. \\n\\nQuis itaque stultior me. . .\" \\n\\n\"Hey boy!\" the cry came again. \"I found you a stone, one \\n\\nlikely to fit.\" \\n\\nThis time when Brother Francis looked up, he caught a \\n\\nglimpse of the pilgrim\\'s staff waving signals to him beyond \\n\\nthe top of a rubble heap. Sighing, the novice returned to \\n\\nhis reading. \\n\\n\"O inscrutabilis Scrutator animarum, cui patet omne cor, si \\n\\nme vocaveras, olim a te fugeram. Si autem nunc velis \\n\\nvocare me indignum. . .\" \\n\\nAnd, irritably from beyond the rubble mound: \"All right, \\n\\nthen, suit yourself. I\\'ll mark the rock and set a stake by it. \\n\\nTry it or not, as you please.\" \\n\\n\"Thank you,\" the novice sighed, but doubted that the old \\n\\nman heard him. He toiled on with the text: \\n\\n\"Libera me, Domine, ab vitiis meis, ut solius tuae \\n\\nvoluntatis mihi cupidus sim, et vocationis. . .\" \\n\\n\"There, then!\" the pilgrim shouted. \"It\\'s staked and \\n\\nmarked. And may you find your voice soon, boy. Olla \\n\\nallay!\" \\n\\nSoon after the last shout faded and died, Brother Francis \\n\\ncaught a glimpse of the pilgrim trudging away on the trail \\n\\nthat led toward the abbey. The novice whispered a swift \\n\\nblessing after him, and a prayer for safe wayfaring. \\n\\nHis privacy having been restored, Brother Francis returned \\n\\nthe book to his burrow and resumed his haphazard \\n\\nstonemasonry, not yet troubling himself to investigate the \\n\\npilgrim\\'s find. While his starved body heaved, strained, and \\n\\nstaggered under the weight of the rocks, his mind, \\n\\nmachinelike kept repeating the prayer for the certainty of \\n\\nhis vocation: \\n\\n\"Libera me, Domine, ab vitiis meis. . . Set me free, O Lord, \\n\\nfrom my own vices, so that in my own heart I may be \\n\\ndesirous of only Thy will, and be aware of Thy summons if \\n\\nit come. . . ut solius tuae voluntatis mihi cupidus sim, et \\n\\nvocationis tuae conscius si digneris me vocare. Amen. \\n\\n\"Set me free, O Lord, from my own vices, so that in my \\n\\nown heart. . .\" \\n\\nA sky-herd of cumulus clouds, on their way to bestow \\n\\nmoist blessings on the mountains after cruelly deceiving \\n\\nthe parched desert, began blotting out the sun and trailing \\n\\ndark shadow-shapes across the blistered land below, \\n\\noffering intermittent but welcome respite from the searing \\n\\nsunlight. When a racing cloud-shadow wiped its way over \\n\\nthe ruins, the novice worked rapidly until the shadow was \\n\\ngone, then rested until the next bundle of fleece blotted \\n\\nout the sun. \\n\\nIt was quite by accident that Brother Francis finally \\n\\ndiscovered the pilgrim\\'s stone. While wandering \\n\\nthereabouts, he stumbled over the stake which the old \\n\\nman had driven into the ground as a marker. He found \\n\\nhimself on his hands and knees staring at a pair of marks \\n\\nfreshly chalked on an ancient stone: ** [Note: Here, as \\n\\nelsewhere in this novel, Hebrew characters are \\n\\nrepresented by *\\'s.] \\n\\nThe marks were so carefully drawn that Brother Francis \\n\\nimmediately assumed them to be symbols, but minutes of \\n\\nmusing over them left him still bemused. Witch markings \\n\\nperhaps? But no, the old man had called: \"God-with-you,\" \\n\\nas a witch would not. The novice pried the stone free from \\n\\nthe rubble and rolled it over. As he did so, the rock mound \\n\\nrumbled faintly from within; a small stone clattered down \\n\\nthe slope. Francis danced away from a possible avalanche, \\n\\nbut the disturbance was momentary. In the place where \\n\\nthe pilgrim\\'s rock had been wedged, however, there now \\n\\nappeared a small black hole. \\n\\nHoles were often inhabited. \\n\\nBut this hole seemed to have been so tightly corked by the \\n\\npilgrim\\'s stone that scarcely a flea could have entered it \\n\\nbefore Francis had overturned the rock. Nevertheless, he \\n\\nfound a stick and gingerly thrust it into the opening. The \\n\\nstick encountered no resistance. When he released it, the \\n\\nstick slid into the hole and vanished, as if into a larger \\n\\nunderground cavity. He waited nervously. Nothing \\n\\nslithered forth. \\n\\nHe sank to his knees again and cautiously sniffed at the \\n\\nhole. Having noticed neither an animal odor nor any hint of \\n\\nbrimstone, he rolled a bit of gravel into it and leaned closer \\n\\nto listen. The gravel bounced once, a few feet below the \\n\\nopening, and then kept rattling its way downward, struck \\n\\nsomething metallic in passing, and finally came to rest \\n\\nsomewhere far below. Echoes suggested an underground \\n\\nopening the size of a room. \\n\\nBrother Francis climbed unsteadily to his feet and looked \\n\\naround. He seemed alone, as usual, except for his \\n\\ncompanion buzzard which, soaring on high, had been \\n\\nwatching him with such interest lately that other buzzards \\n\\noccasionally left their territories near the horizons and \\n\\ncame to investigate. \\n\\nThe novice circled the rubble heap, but found no sign of a \\n\\nsecond hole. He climbed an adjacent heap and squinted \\n\\ndown the trail. The pilgrim had long since vanished. \\n\\nNothing moved along the old roadway, but he caught a \\n\\nfleeting glimpse of Brother Alfred crossing a low hill a mile \\n\\nto the east in search of firewood near his own Lenten \\n\\nhermitage. Brother Alfred was deaf as a post. There was \\n\\nno one else in view. Francis foresaw no reason whatever to \\n\\nresults of such a scream, if the need should arise, seemed \\n\\nonly an exercise of prudence. After a careful scrutiny of the \\n\\nterrain, he climbed down from the mound. Breath needed \\n\\nfor screaming would be better used for running. \\n\\nHe thought of replacing the pilgrim\\'s stone to cork the hole \\n\\nas before, but the adjacent stones had shifted slightly so \\n\\nthat it no longer fit its previous place in the puzzle. \\n\\nBesides, the gap in the highest tier of his shelter wall \\n\\nsize and shape suggested a probable fit. After only brief \\n\\nburrow. \\n\\nThe stone slipped neatly into place. He tested the new \\n\\nwedge with a kick; the tier held fast, even though the jolt \\n\\ncaused a minor collapse a few feet away. The pilgrim\\'s \\n\\nstill clear enough to be copied. Brother Francis carefully \\n\\nredrew them on another rock, using a charred stick as a \\n\\nstylus. When Prior Cheroki made his Sabbath tour of the \\n\\nhermitages, perhaps the priest would be able to say \\n\\nwhether the marks had meaning, either as charm or curse. \\n\\nTo fear the pagan cabals was forbidden, but the novice \\n\\nwas curious at least to learn what sign would be \\n\\noverhanging his sleeping pit, in view of the weight of the \\n\\nmasonry on which the sign was written. \\n\\nHis labors continued through the heat of the afternoon. A \\n\\ncorner of his mind kept reminding him of the hole– the \\n\\ninteresting, and yet fearsome, little hole– and the way the \\n\\nrattle of gravel had caused faint echoes from somewhere \\n\\nbelow ground. He knew that the ruins all about him here \\n\\nwere very old. He knew also, from tradition, that the ruins \\n\\nhad been gradually eroded into these anomalous heaps of \\n\\nmen seeking a load of stone or looking for the bits of rusty \\n\\nsteel which could be found by shattering the larger \\n\\nsections of columns and slabs to extract the ancient strips \\n\\nof that metal, mysteriously planted in the rocks by men of \\n\\nhad all but obliterated the resemblance to buildings, which \\n\\ntradition ascribed to the ruins in an earlier period, although \\n\\nthe abbey\\'s present masterbuilder still took pride in his \\n\\nability to sense and to point out the vestige of a floor plan \\n\\nhere and there. And there was still metal to be found, if \\n\\nanyone cared to break enough rock to find it. \\n\\nThe abbey itself had been built of these stones. That \\n\\nseveral centuries of stonemasons might have left anything \\n\\nof interest still to be discovered in the ruins, Francis \\n\\nregarded as improbable fancy. And yet, he had never \\n\\nheard anyone mention buildings with basements or \\n\\nunderground rooms. The master-builder, he recalled at \\n\\nlast, had been quite specific in saying that the buildings at \\n\\nthis site had had aspects of hasty construction, lacked \\n\\ndeep foundations, and had rested for the most part on flat \\n\\nsurface slabs. \\n\\nWith his shelter approaching completion, Brother Francis \\n\\nventured back to the hole and stood looking down at it; he \\n\\nwas unable to put off the desert-dweller\\'s conviction that \\n\\nalready hiding in it. Even if the hole was now uninhabited, \\n\\nsomething would certainly slither into it before tomorrow\\'s \\n\\ndawn. On the other hand, if something already lived in the \\n\\nhole, Francis thought it safer to make its acquaintance by \\n\\nday than by night. There seemed to be no tracks in the \\n\\nvicinity except his own, the pilgrim\\'s, and the tracks of the \\n\\nwolves. \\n\\nMaking a quick decision, he began clearing rubble and \\n\\nsand away from the hole. After half an hour of this, the \\n\\nhole was no larger, but his conviction that it opened into a \\n\\nsubterranean pit had become a certainty. Two small \\n\\nboulders, half buried, and adjoining the opening, were \\n\\nobviously jammed together by the force of too much mass \\n\\ncrowding the mouth of a shaft; they seemed caught in a \\n\\nbottleneck. When he pried one stone toward the right, its \\n\\nneighbor rolled left, until no further motion was possible. \\n\\nThe reverse effect occurred when he pried in the opposing \\n\\ndirection, but he continued to jostle at the rock-jam. \\n\\nHis lever spontaneously leaped from his grasp, delivered a \\n\\nglancing blow to the side of his head, and disappeared in a \\n\\nsudden cave-in. The sharp blow sent him reeling. A flying \\n\\nstone from the rockslide struck him in the back and he fell \\n\\ngasping, uncertain whether or not he was falling into the \\n\\npit until the instant his belly hit solid ground and he \\n\\nhugged it. The roar of the rockfall was deafening but brief. \\n\\nBlinded by dust, Francis lay gasping for breath and \\n\\nwondering whether he dared to move, so sharp was the \\n\\npain in his back. Having recovered a little breath, he \\n\\nmanaged to get one hand inside his habit and groped for \\n\\nthe place between his shoulders where a few crushed \\n\\nbones might be. The place felt rough, and it stung. His \\n\\nfingers came away damp and red. He moved, but groaned \\n\\nand lay quietly again. \\n\\nThere was a soft beating of wings. Brother Francis glanced \\n\\nup in time to see the buzzard preparing to alight on a \\n\\nrubble heap a few yards away. The bird took wing again at \\n\\nonce, but Francis imagined that it had eyed him with a sort \\n\\nof motherly concern in the manner of a worried hen. He \\n\\nrolled over quickly. A whole black heavenly host of them \\n\\nhad gathered, and they circled at a curiously low altitude. \\n\\nJust skimming the mounds. They soared higher when he \\n\\nmoved. Suddenly ignoring the possibility of chipped \\n\\nvertebrae or a crushed rib, the novice climbed shakily to \\n\\nhis feet. Disappointed, the black sky-horde rode back to \\n\\naltitude on their invisible elevators of hot air, then \\n\\ndisbanded and dispersed toward their remoter aerial vigils. \\n\\nDark alternatives to the Paraclete whose coming he \\n\\nawaited, the birds seemed eager at times to descend in \\n\\nplace of the Dove; their sporadic interest had been \\n\\nunnerving him of late, and he promptly decided, after \\n\\nsome experimental shrugging, that the sharp rock had \\n\\ndone no more than bruise and scrape. \\n\\nA dust column which had plumed up from the site of the \\n\\ncavein was tapering away on the breeze. He hoped \\n\\nsomeone would see it from the abbey\\'s watchtowers and \\n\\ncome to investigate. At his feet, a square opening yawned \\n\\nin the earth, where one flank of the mound had collapsed \\n\\ninto the pit below. Stairs led downward, but only the top \\n\\nsteps remained unburied by the avalanche which had \\n\\npaused for six centuries in mid-fall to await the assistance \\n\\nof Brother Francis before completing its roaring descent. \\n\\nOn one wall of the stair well a half-buried sign remained \\n\\nlegible. Mustering his modest command of pre-Deluge \\n\\nEnglish, he whispered the words haltingly:  \\n\\nFALLOUT SURVIVAL SHELTER \\n\\nMaximum Occupancy: 15\\n\\n Provision limitations, single occupant: 180 days; divide \\n\\nby actual number of occupants. Upon entering shelter, \\n\\nsee that First Hatch is securely locked and sealed, that the\\n\\n intruder shields are electrified to repel contaminated \\n\\npersons attempting entry, that the warning lights are ON\\n\\n outside the enclosure. . . \\n\\nThe rest was buried, but the first word was enough for \\n\\nFrancis. He had never seen a \"Fallout,\" and he hoped he\\'d \\n\\nnever see one. A consistent description of the monster had \\n\\nnot survived, but Francis had heard the legends. He \\n\\ncrossed himself and backed away from the hole. Tradition \\n\\ntold that the Beatus Leibowitz himself had encountered a \\n\\nFallout, and had been possessed by it for many months \\n\\nbefore the exorcism which accompanied his Baptism drove \\n\\nthe fiend away. \\n\\nBrother Francis visualized a Fallout as half-salamander, \\n\\nbecause, according to tradition, the thing was born in the \\n\\ntheir sleep, for, were not the monsters of the world still \\n\\ncalled \"children of the Fallout\"? That the demon was \\n\\ncapable of inflicting all the woes which descended upon Job \\n\\nwas recorded fact, if not an article of creed. \\n\\nThe novice stared at the sign in dismay. Its meaning was \\n\\nplain enough. He had unwittingly broken into the abode \\n\\n(deserted, he prayed) of not just one, but fifteen of the \\n\\ndreadful beings! He groped for his phial of holy water. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Two \\n\\n\"A spiritu fomicationis,\\n\\n Domine, hibera nos. \\n\\nFrom the lightning and the tempest,\\n\\n O Lord, deliver us. \\n\\nFrom the scourge of the earthquake,\\n\\n O Lord, deliver us. \\n\\nFrom plague, famine, and war,\\n\\n O Lord, deliver us. \\n\\n\"From the place of ground zero,\\n\\n O Lord, deliver us. \\n\\nFrom the rain of the cobalt, \\n\\n O Lord, deliver us. \\n\\nFrom the rain of the strontium,\\n\\n O Lord, deliver us. \\n\\nFrom the fall of the cesium,\\n\\n O Lord, deliver us. \\n\\n\"From the curse of the Fallout,\\n\\n O Lord, deliver us. \\n\\nFrom the begetting of monsters,\\n\\n O Lord, deliver us. \\n\\nFrom the curse of the Misborn,\\n\\n O Lord, deliver us. \\n\\nA morte perpetua,  \\n\\n Domine, libera nos.  \\n\\n\"Peccatores, te rogamus, audi nos. \\n\\nThat thou wouldst spare us,\\n\\n we beseech thee, hear us. \\n\\nThat thou wouldst pardon us,\\n\\n we beseech thee, hear us. \\n\\nThat thou wouldst bring us truly to penance,\\n\\n te rogamus, audi nos.\" \\n\\nSnatches of such versicles from the Litany of the Saints \\n\\ncame whispering on each panting breath as Brother Francis \\n\\nlowered himself gingerly into the stair well of the ancient \\n\\nFallout Shelter, armed as he was only with holy water and \\n\\nan improvised torch lighted from the banked embers of \\n\\nlast night\\'s fire. He had waited more than an hour for \\n\\nsomeone from the abbey to come investigate the dust \\n\\nplume. No one had come. \\n\\nTo abandon his vocational vigil even briefly, unless \\n\\nseriously ill or unless ordered to return to the abbey, would \\n\\nbe regarded as an ipso facto renunciation of his claim of a \\n\\ntrue vocation to life as a monk of the Albertian Order of \\n\\nLeibowitz. Brother Francis would have preferred death. He \\n\\nwas faced, therefore, with the choice of investigating the \\n\\nfearsome pit before sunset, or of spending the night in his \\n\\nburrow in ignorance of whatever might lurk in the shelter \\n\\nand might reawaken to prowl in darkness. As a nocturnal \\n\\nhazard, the wolves already made trouble enough, and the \\n\\nwolves were merely creatures of flesh and blood. Creatures \\n\\nof less solid substance, he preferred to meet by the light of \\n\\nday; although, to be sure, scant daylight fell into the pit \\n\\nbelow, the sun now being low in the west. \\n\\nThe debris which had crashed down into the shelter formed \\n\\na hill with its crest near the head of the stairs, and there \\n\\nwas only a narrow squeezeway between the rocks and the \\n\\nceiling. He went through it feet first and found himself \\n\\nforced to continue feet first, because of the steepness of \\n\\nthe slope. Thus confronting the Unknown face-to-backside, \\n\\nhe groped for footholds in the loose heap of broken stone \\n\\nand gradually worked his way downward. Occasionally, \\n\\nwhen his torch flickered low, he paused to tilt its flame \\n\\ndownward, letting the fire spread further along the wood; \\n\\nduring such pauses, he tried to appraise the danger about \\n\\nhim and below. There was little to be seen. He was in an \\n\\nunderground room, but at least one third of its volume was \\n\\nfilled by the mound of debris that had fallen through the \\n\\nstair well. The cascade of stone had covered all the floor, \\n\\ncrushed several pieces of furniture that he could see, and \\n\\nperhaps had completely buried others. He saw battered \\n\\nmetal lockers leaning awry, waist-deep in rubble. At the far \\n\\nend of the room was a metal door, hinged to swing toward \\n\\nhim, and tightly sealed by the avalanche. Still legible in \\n\\nflaking paint on the door were the stenciled letters:\\n\\n INNER HATCH \\n\\nSEALED ENVIRONMENT \\n\\nEvidently the room into which he was descending was only  \\n\\nwas sealed there by several tons of rock against the door. \\n\\nIts environment was SEALED indeed, unless it had another \\n\\nexit. \\n\\nHaving made his way to the foot of the slope, and after \\n\\nassuring himself that the antechamber contained no \\n\\nobvious menace, the novice went cautiously to inspect the \\n\\nmetal door at closer range by torchlight. Printed under the \\n\\nstenciled letters of INNER HATCH was a smaller \\n\\nrust-streaked sign:\\n\\n WARNING: This hatch must not be sealed before all \\n\\npersonnel have been admitted, or before all steps of safety \\n\\nprocedure prescribed by Technical Manual CD-Bu-83A have \\n\\nbeen accomplished. When Hatch is sealed, air within \\n\\nshelter will be pressurized 2.0 p.s.i. above ambient \\n\\nbarometric level to minimize inward diffusion. Once sealed, \\n\\nthe hatch will be automatically unlocked by the \\n\\nservomonitor system when, but not before, any of the \\n\\nfollowing conditions prevail: (1) when the exterior \\n\\nradiation count falls below the danger level, \\n\\n (2) when the air and water repurification system fails, \\n\\n(3) when the food supply is exhausted, \\n\\n(4) when the internal power supply fails. See \\n\\nCD-Bu-83A for further instructions. \\n\\nBrother Francis found himself slightly confused by the \\n\\nWarning, but he intended to heed it by not touching the \\n\\ndoor at all. The miraculous contraptions of the ancients \\n\\nwere not to be carelessly tampered with, as many a dead \\n\\nexcavator-of-the-past had testified with his dying gasp. \\n\\nBrother Francis noticed that the debris which had been \\n\\nlying in the antechamber for centuries was darker in color \\n\\nand rougher in texture than the debris which had \\n\\nweathered under the desert sun and in the sandy wind \\n\\nbefore today\\'s cave-in. One could tell by a glance at the \\n\\nstones that Inner Hatch had been blocked not by today\\'s \\n\\nrockslide but by one more ancient than the abbey itself. If \\n\\nFallout Shelter\\'s Sealed Environment contained a Fallout, \\n\\nthe demon had obviously not opened Inner Hatch since the \\n\\ntime of the Flame Deluge, before the Simplification. And; if \\n\\nit had been sealed beyond the metal door for so many \\n\\ncenturies, there was small reason, Francis told himself, to \\n\\nHoly Saturday. \\n\\nHis torch burned low. Having found a splintered chair leg, \\n\\nhe set it ablaze with his waning flame, then began \\n\\ngathering bits of broken furniture with which to build a \\n\\ndependable fire, meanwhile pondering the meaning of that \\n\\nancient sign: FALLOUT SURVIVAL SHELTER. \\n\\nAs Brother Francis readily admitted, his mastery of \\n\\npre-Deluge English was far from masterful yet. The way \\n\\nnouns could sometimes modify other nouns in that tongue \\n\\nhad always been one of his weak points. In Latin, as in \\n\\nmost simple dialects of the region, a construction like \\n\\nservus puer meant about the same thing as puer servus, \\n\\nand even in English slave boy meant boy slave. But there \\n\\nthe similarity ended. He had finally learned that house cat \\n\\ndid not mean cat house, and that a dative of purpose or \\n\\npossession, as in mihi amicus, was somehow conveyed by \\n\\ndog food or sentry box even without inflection. But what of \\n\\na triple appositive like fallout survival shelter? Brother \\n\\nFrancis shook his head. The Warning on Inner Hatch \\n\\nmentioned food, water, and air; and yet surely these were \\n\\nnot necessities for the fiends of Hell. At times, the novice \\n\\nfound pre-Deluge English more perplexing than either \\n\\nIntermediate Angelology or Saint Leslie\\'s theological \\n\\ncalculus. \\n\\nHe built his fire on the slope of the rubble pile, where it \\n\\ncould brighten the darker crannies of the antechamber. \\n\\nThen he went to explore whatever might remain uncovered \\n\\nby debris. The ruins above ground had been reduced to \\n\\narchaeological ambiguity by generations of scavengers, but \\n\\nthis underground ruin had been touched by no hand but \\n\\nthe hand of impersonal disaster. The place seemed \\n\\nhaunted by the presences of another age. A skull, lying \\n\\namong the rocks in a darker corner, still retained a gold \\n\\ntooth in its grin– clear evidence that the shelter had never \\n\\nbeen invaded by wanderers. The gold incisor flickered \\n\\nwhen the fire danced high. \\n\\nMore than once in the desert had Brother Francis \\n\\nencountered, near some parched arroyo, a small heap of \\n\\nhuman bones, picked clean and whitening in the sun. He \\n\\nwas not especially squeamish, and one expected such \\n\\nthings. He was, therefore, not startled when he first \\n\\nnoticed the skull in the corner of the antechamber, but the \\n\\nflicker of gold in its grin kept catching his eye while he \\n\\npried at the doors (locked or stuck) of the rusty lockers \\n\\nand tugged at the drawers (also stuck) of a battered metal \\n\\ndesk. The desk might prove to be a priceless find, if it \\n\\ncontained documents or a small book or two that had \\n\\nsurvived the angry bonfires of the Age of Simplification. \\n\\nWhile he kept trying to open the drawers, the fire burned \\n\\nlow; he fancied that the skull began emitting a faint glow \\n\\nof its own. Such a phenomenon was not especially \\n\\nuncommon, but in the gloomy crypt, Brother Francis found \\n\\nit somehow most disturbing. He gathered more wood for \\n\\nthe fire, returned to jerk and tug at the desk, and tried to \\n\\nignore the skull\\'s flickering grin. While a little wary yet of \\n\\nlurking Fallouts, Francis had sufficiently recovered from his \\n\\ninitial fright to realize that the shelter, notably the desk \\n\\nand the lockers, might well be teeming with rich relics of \\n\\nan age which the world had, for the most part, deliberately \\n\\nchosen to forget. \\n\\nProvidence had bestowed a blessing here. To find a bit of \\n\\nthe past which had escaped both the bonfires and the \\n\\nlooting scavengers was a rare stroke of luck these days. \\n\\nThere was, however, always a risk involved. Monastic \\n\\nexcavators, alert for ancient treasures, had been known to \\n\\nemerge from a hole in the ground, triumphantly carrying a \\n\\nstrange cylindrical artifact, and then– while cleaning it or \\n\\ntrying to ascertain its purpose– press the wrong button or \\n\\nbenefit of clergy. Only eighty years ago the Venerable \\n\\nBoedullus had written with obvious delight to his Lord \\n\\nAbbot that his small expedition had uncovered the remains \\n\\nof, in his own words, \"the site of an intercontinental \\n\\nlaunching pad, complete with several fascinating \\n\\nsubterranean storage tanks.\" No one at the abbey ever \\n\\nknew what the Venerable Boedullus meant by \\n\\n\"intercontinental launching pad,\" but the Lord Abbot who \\n\\nhad reigned at that time sternly decreed that monastic \\n\\nantiquarians must, on pain of excommunication, avoid \\n\\nsuch \"pads\" thenceforth. For his letter to the abbot was the \\n\\nlast that anyone ever saw of the Venerable Boedullus, his \\n\\nparty, his \"launching pad\" site, and the small village which \\n\\nhad grown up over that site; an interesting lake now \\n\\ngraced the landscape where the village had been, thanks \\n\\nto some shepherds who diverted the course of a creek and \\n\\ncaused it to flow into the crater to store water for their \\n\\nflocks in time of drought. A traveler who had come from \\n\\nthat direction about a decade ago reported excellent \\n\\nfishing in that lake, but the shepherds thereabouts \\n\\nregarded the fish as the souls of the departed villagers and \\n\\nexcavators; they refused to fish there because of Bo\\'dollos, \\n\\nthe giant catfish that brooded in the deep. \\n\\n\". . . nor shall any other excavation be initiated which does \\n\\nnot have as its primary purpose the augmentation of the \\n\\nMemorabilia,\" the Lord Abbot\\'s decree had added– \\n\\nmeaning that Brother Francis should search the shelter \\n\\nonly for books and papers, not tampering with interesting \\n\\nhardware. \\n\\nThe gold-capped tooth kept winking and glittering at the \\n\\ncorner of his eye while Brother Francis heaved and \\n\\nstrained at the desk drawers. The drawers refused to \\n\\nbudge. He gave the desk a final kick and turned to glare \\n\\nimpatiently at the skull: Why don\\'t you grin at something \\n\\nelse for a change? \\n\\nThe grin remained. The gold-toothed residuum lay with its \\n\\nhead pillowed between a rock and a rusty metal box. \\n\\nQuitting the desk, the novice picked his way across the \\n\\ndebris at last for a closer inspection of the mortal remains. \\n\\nClearly, the person had died on the spot, struck down by \\n\\nthe torrent of stones and half buried by the debris. Only \\n\\nthe skull and the bones of one leg had not been covered. \\n\\nThe femur was broken, the back of the skull was crushed. \\n\\nBrother Francis breathed a prayer for the departed, then \\n\\nvery gently lifted the skull from its resting place and \\n\\nhis eye fell on the rusty box. \\n\\nThe box was shaped like a satchel and was obviously a \\n\\ncarrying case of some kind. It might have served any \\n\\nnumber of purposes, but it had been rather badly battered \\n\\nby flying stones. Gingerly he worked it loose from the \\n\\nrubble and carried it closer to the fire. The lock seemed to \\n\\nbe broken, but the lid had rusted shut. The box rattled \\n\\nwhen he shook it. It was not an obvious place to look for \\n\\ninformation for the Memorabilia. Nevertheless, \\n\\nsprinkled it with holy water before attempting to pry it \\n\\nopen, and he handled the ancient relic as reverently as \\n\\nwas possible while battering at its rusty hinges with a \\n\\nstone. \\n\\nAt last he broke the hinges, and the lid fell free. Small \\n\\nmetal tidbits bounced from trays, spilled among the rocks, \\n\\nsome of them falling irretrievably into crevices. But, in the \\n\\nbottom of the box in the space beneath the trays, he \\n\\nbeheld– papers! After a quick prayer of thanksgiving, he \\n\\nregathered as many of the scattered tidbits as he could, \\n\\nand, after loosely replacing the lid, began climbing the hill \\n\\nof debris toward the stair well and the thin patch of sky, \\n\\nwith the box hugged tightly under one arm. \\n\\nscarcely bothered to notice that it was sinking dangerously \\n\\nlow in the west, but began at once to search for a flat slab \\n\\non which the contents of the box could be spread for \\n\\nexamination without risk of losing anything in the sand. \\n\\nbegan removing the tidbits of metal and glass that filled \\n\\nthe trays. Most of them were small tubular things with a \\n\\nwire whisker at each end of each tube. These, he had seen \\n\\nbefore. The abbey\\'s small museum had a few of them, of \\n\\nvarious size, shape and color. Once he had seen a shaman \\n\\nof the hill-pagan people wearing a string of them as a \\n\\nceremonial necklace. The hill people thought of them as \\n\\n\"parts of the body of the god\"– of the fabled Machina \\n\\nanalytica, hailed as the wisest of their gods. By swallowing \\n\\none of them, a shaman could acquire \"Infallibility,\" they \\n\\nsaid. He certainly acquired Indisputabiity that way, among \\n\\nhis own people– unless he swallowed one of the poison \\n\\nkind. The similar tidbits in the museum were connected \\n\\ntogether too– not in the form of a necklace, but as a \\n\\ncomplex and rather disorderly maze in the bottom of a \\n\\nsmall metal box, exhibited as: \"Radio Chassis: Application \\n\\nUncertain.\" \\n\\nInside the lid of the carrying case, a note had been glued; \\n\\nthe glue had powdered, the ink had faded, and the paper \\n\\nwas so darkened by rusty stains that even good \\n\\nhandwriting would have been hard enough to read, but \\n\\nthis was written in a hasty scrawl. He studied it \\n\\nEnglish, of a sort, but half an hour passed before he \\n\\ndeciphered most of the message: \\n\\nCARL--\\n\\nMust grab plane for [undecipherable] in twenty minutes. \\n\\nFor God\\'s sake, keep Em there till we know if we\\'re at war. \\n\\nPlease! try to get her on the alternate list for the shelter. \\n\\nCan\\'t get her a seat my plane. Don\\'t tell her why I sent her \\n\\nover with this box of junk, but try to keep her there till we \\n\\nshow. \\n\\nI.E.L. \\n\\nP.S. I put the seal on the lock and put TOP SECRET on the \\n\\nlid just to keep Em from looking inside. First tool box I \\n\\nhappened to grab. Shove it in my locker or something. \\n\\nThe note seemed hasty gibberish to Brother Francis, who \\n\\nwas at the moment too excited to concentrate on any \\n\\nsingle item more than the rest. After a final sneer at the \\n\\nnote-writer\\'s hasty scrawl, he began the task of removing \\n\\nthe tray-racks to get at the papers in the bottom of the \\n\\nbox. The trays were mounted on a swinging linkage which \\n\\nstair-step array, but the pins were rusted fast, and Francis \\n\\nfound it necessary to pry them out with a short steel tool \\n\\nfrom one of the tray compartments. \\n\\nWhen Brother Francis had removed the last tray, he \\n\\ntouched the papers reverently: only a handful of folded \\n\\ndocuments here, and yet a treasure; for they had escaped \\n\\nthe angry flames of the Simplification, wherein even sacred \\n\\nwritings had curled, blackened, and withered into smoke \\n\\nwhile ignorant mobs howled and hailed it a triumph. He \\n\\nhandled the papers as one might handle holy things, \\n\\nshielding them from the wind with his habit, for all were \\n\\nbrittle and cracked from age. There was a sheaf of rough \\n\\nsketches and diagrams. There were hand-scribbled notes, \\n\\nFirst he examined the jotted notes. They were scrawled by \\n\\nthe same hand that had written the note glued to the lid, \\n\\nand the penmanship was no less abominable. Pound \\n\\npastrami, said one note, can kraut, six bagels– bring home \\n\\nfor Emma. Another reminded: Remember– pick up Form \\n\\n1040, Uncle Revenue. Another was only a column of \\n\\nfigures with a circled total from which a second amount \\n\\nwas subtracted and finally a percentage taken, followed by \\n\\nthe word damn! Brother Francis checked the figures; he \\n\\ncould find no fault with the abominable penman\\'s \\n\\narithmetic, at least, although he could deduce nothing \\n\\nabout what the quantities might represent. \\n\\nMemo, he handled with special reverence, because its title \\n\\nwas suggestive of \"Memorabilia.\" Before opening it, he \\n\\ncrossed himself and murmured the Blessing of Texts. But \\n\\nthe small book proved a disappointment. He had expected \\n\\nprinted matter, but found only a hand-written list of \\n\\nnames, places, numbers and dates. The dates ranged \\n\\nthrough the latter part of the fifth decade, and earlier part \\n\\nof the sixth decade, twentieth century. Again it was \\n\\naffirmed!– the contents of the shelter came from the \\n\\ntwilight period of the Age of Enlightenment. An important \\n\\ndiscovery indeed. \\n\\nOf the larger folded papers, one was tightly rolled as well, \\n\\nand it began to fall apart when he tried to unroll it; he \\n\\ncould make out the words RACING FORM, but nothing \\n\\nmore. After returning it to the box for later restorative \\n\\nwork, he turned to the second folded document; its \\n\\ncreases were so brittle that he dared inspect only a little of \\n\\nit, by parting the folds slightly and peering between them. \\n\\nA diagram, it seemed, but– a diagram of white lines on \\n\\ndark paper! \\n\\nAgain he felt the thrill of discovery. It was clearly a \\n\\nblueprint!– and there was not a single original blueprint \\n\\nleft at the abbey, but only inked facsimiles of several such \\n\\nprints. The originals had faded long ago from overexposure \\n\\nto light. Never before had Francis seen an original, \\n\\nalthough he had seen enough handpainted reproductions \\n\\nto recognize it as a blueprint, which, while stained and \\n\\nfaded, remained legible after so many centuries because of \\n\\nthe total darkness and low humidity in the shelter. He \\n\\nturned the document over– and felt brief fury. What idiot \\n\\nhad desecrated the priceless paper? Someone had \\n\\nsketched absentminded geometrical figures and childish \\n\\ncartoon faces all over the back. What thoughtless vandal– \\n\\nof the deed, blueprints had probably been as common as \\n\\nshielded the print from the sun with his own shadow while \\n\\ntrying to unfold it further. In the lower right-hand corner \\n\\nwas a printed rectangle containing, in simple block letters, \\n\\nvarious titles, dates, \"patent numbers,\" reference \\n\\nnumbers, and names. His eye traveled down the list until it \\n\\nencountered: \"CIRCUIT DESIGN BY: Leibowitz, I. E.\" \\n\\nHe closed his eyes tightly and shook his head until it \\n\\nplainly: \\n\\nCIRCUIT DESIGN BY: Leibowitz, I. E. \\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nHe flipped the paper over again. Among the geometric \\n\\nfigures and childish sketches, clearly stamped in purple \\n\\nink, was the form: \\n\\n| THIS FILE COPY TO: \\n| \\n\\n| \\n| \\n\\n| \\nSupv ................. | \\n\\n| \\nPlnt ................. | \\n\\n| x Dsgn I. E. Leibowitz | \\n\\n| \\nEngr ................. | \\n\\n| \\nArmy ................. | \\n\\nThe name was written in a clear feminine hand, not in the \\n\\nhasty scrawl of the other notes. He looked again at the \\n\\ninitialed signature of the note in the lid of the box: I. E. L.– \\n\\nand again at \"CIRCUIT DESIGN BY.. .\" And the same \\n\\ninitials appeared elsewhere throughout the notes. \\n\\nThere had been argument, all highly conjectural, about \\n\\nwhether the beatified founder of the Order, if finally \\n\\ncanonized, should be addressed as Saint Isaac or as Saint \\n\\nEdward. Some even favored Saint Leibowitz as the proper \\n\\nreferred to by his surname. \\n\\n\"Beate Leibowitz, ora pro me!\" whispered Brother Francis. \\n\\nHis hands were trembling so violently that they threatened \\n\\nto ruin the brittle documents. \\n\\nHe had uncovered relics of the Saint. \\n\\nOf course, New Rome had not yet proclaimed that \\n\\nLeibowitz was a saint, but Brother Francis was so \\n\\nconvinced of it that he made bold to add: \"Sancte \\n\\nLeibowitz, ora pro me!\" \\n\\nBrother Francis wasted no idle logic in leaping to his \\n\\nimmediate conclusion: he had just been granted a token of \\n\\nhis vocation by Heaven itself. He had found what he had \\n\\nbeen sent into the desert to find, as Brother Francis saw it. \\n\\nHe was called to be a professed monk of the Order. \\n\\nForgetting his abbot\\'s stern warning against expecting a \\n\\nvocation to come in any spectacular or miraculous form, \\n\\nthe novice knelt in the sand to pray his thanks and to offer \\n\\na few decades of the rosary for the intentions of the old \\n\\npilgrim who had pointed out the rock leading to the \\n\\nshelter. May you find your Voice soon, boy, the wanderer \\n\\nhad said. Not until now did the novice suspect that the \\n\\npilgrim meant Voice with a capital V. \\n\\n\"Ut solius tuae voluntatis mihi cupidus sim, et vocationis \\n\\ntuae conscius, si digneris me vocare. . .\" \\n\\nIt would be left to the abbot to think that his \"voice\" was \\n\\nspeaking the language of circumstances and not the \\n\\nlanguage of cause and effect. It would be left to the \\n\\nan uncommon name before the Flame Deluge, and that I. \\n\\nE. could as easily represent \"Ichabod Ebenezer\" as \"Isaac \\n\\nEdward.\" For Francis, there was only one. \\n\\nFrom the distant abbey, three bell notes rang out across \\n\\nthe desert, a pause, then the three notes were followed by \\n\\nnine. \\n\\n\"Angelus Domini nuntiavit Mariae,\" the novice dutifully \\n\\nresponded glancing up in surprise to see that the sun had \\n\\nbecome a fat scarlet ellipse that already touched the \\n\\nwestern horizon. The rock barrier around his burrow was \\n\\nnot yet complete. \\n\\nAs soon as the Angelus was said, he hastily repacked the \\n\\npapers in the rusty old box. A call from Heaven did not \\n\\nnecessarily involve charismata for subduing wild beasts or \\n\\nbefriending hungry wolves. \\n\\nhis makeshift shelter was as well fortified as he could make \\n\\nit; whether it was wolf-proof remained to be tested. The \\n\\ntest would not be long in coming. He had already heard a \\n\\nfew howls from the west. His fire was rekindled, but there \\n\\nwas no light left outside the circle of firelight to permit the \\n\\ngathering of his daily collection of purple cactus fruit– his \\n\\nonly source of nourishment except on Sundays, when a \\n\\nfew handfuls of parched corn were sent from the abbey \\n\\nafter a priest had made his rounds with the Holy \\n\\nSacrament. The letter of the rule for a Lenten vocational \\n\\nvigil was not so strict as its practical application. As \\n\\napplied, the rule amounted to simple starvation. \\n\\nTonight, however, the gnawing of hunger was less \\n\\ntroublesome to Francis than his own impatient urge to run \\n\\nback to the abbey and announce the news of his discovery. \\n\\nTo do so would be to renounce his vocation no sooner than \\n\\nit had come to him; he was here for the duration of Lent, \\n\\nvocation or no vocation, to continue his vigil as if nothing \\n\\nextraordinary had occurred. \\n\\nDreamily, from near the fire, he gazed into the darkness in \\n\\nthe direction of Fallout Survival Shelter and tried to \\n\\nvisualize a towering basilica rising from the site. The \\n\\nfantasy was pleasant, but it was difficult to imagine anyone \\n\\nchoosing this remote stretch of desert as the focal point of \\n\\na future diocese. If not a basilica, then a smaller church– \\n\\nThe Church of Saint Leibowitz of the Wilderness– \\n\\nSaint attracting rivers of pilgrims with girded loins out of \\n\\nthe north. \"Father\" Francis of Utah conducted the pilgrims \\n\\non a tour of the ruins, even through \"Hatch Two\" into the \\n\\nsplendors of \"Sealed Environment\" beyond, the catacombs \\n\\nof the Flame Deluge where . . . where . . . well, \\n\\nafterwards, he would offer Mass for them on the altar \\n\\nstone which enclosed a relic of the church\\'s name-saint– a \\n\\nclippings from the bottom of the rusty box?– or perhaps \\n\\nRACING FORM. But the fantasy withered. The chances of \\n\\nBrother Francis becoming a priest were slight– not being a \\n\\nmissionary Order, the Brothers of Leibowitz needed only \\n\\nenough priests for the abbey itself and a few smaller \\n\\ncommunities of monks in other locations. Furthermore, the \\n\\n\"Saint\" was still only a Beatus officially, and would never \\n\\nbe formally declared a saint unless he wrought a few more \\n\\ngood solid miracles to underwrite his own beatification, \\n\\nwhich was not an infallible proclamation, as canonization \\n\\nwould be, although it permitted the monks of the Leibowitz \\n\\nOrder formally to venerate their founder and patron, \\n\\noutside of the Mass and the Office. The proportions of the \\n\\nfantasy church dwindled to the size of a wayside shrine; \\n\\nthe river of pilgrims shrank to a trickle. New Rome was \\n\\nbusy with other matters, such as the petition for a formal \\n\\ndefinition on the question of the Preternatural Gifts of the \\n\\nHoly Virgin, the Dominicans holding that the Immaculate \\n\\nConception implied not only indwelling grace, but also that \\n\\nthe Blessed Mother had had the preternatural powers \\n\\nwhich were Eve\\'s before the Fall; some theologians of \\n\\nother Orders, while admitting this to be pious conjecture, \\n\\ndenied that it was necessarily the case, and contended \\n\\nthat a \"creature\" might be \"originally innocent\" but not \\n\\nendowed with preternatural gifts. The Dominicans bowed \\n\\nto this, but contended that the belief had always been \\n\\nimplicit in other dogma– such as the Assumption \\n\\n(preternatural immortality) and the Preservation from \\n\\nActual Sin (implying preternatural integrity) and still other \\n\\nexamples. While attempting to settle this dispute, New \\n\\nRome had seemingly left the case for the canonization of \\n\\nLeibowitz to gather dust on the shelf. \\n\\nContenting himself with a small shrine of the Beatus and a \\n\\ncasual trickle of pilgrims, Brother Francis drowsed. When \\n\\nhe awoke, the fire was reduced to glowing embers. \\n\\nSomething seemed amiss. Was he quite alone? He blinked \\n\\naround at the encompassing darkness. \\n\\nFrom beyond the bed of reddish coals, the dark wolf \\n\\nblinked back. \\n\\nThe novice yelped and dived for cover. \\n\\nThe yelp, he decided as he lay trembling within his den of  \\n\\nstones and brush, had been only an involuntary breach of \\n\\nthe rule of silence. He lay hugging the metal box and \\n\\npraying that the days of Lent might pass swiftly, while \\n\\npadded feet scratched about his enclosure. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Three \\n\\n\". . . and then, Father, I almost took the bread and  \\n\\ncheese.\"  \\n\\n\"But you didn\\'t take it?\"  \\n\\n\"No.\"  \\n\\n\"Then there was no sin by deed.\"  \\n\\n\"But I wanted it so badly, I could taste it.\"  \\n\\n\"Willfully? Did you deliberately enjoy the fantasy?\"  \\n\\n\"No.\"  \\n\\n\"You tried to get rid of it.\"  \\n\\n\"Yes.\"  \\n\\n\"So there was not culpable gluttony of thought either. Why  \\n\\nare you confessing this?\"  \\n\\n\"Because then I lost my temper and splashed him with  \\n\\nholy water.\"  \\n\\n\"You what? Why?\" \\n\\nFather Cheroki, wearing his stole, stared at the penitent \\n\\nwho knelt in profile before him in the scorching sunlight on \\n\\nthe open desert; the priest kept wondering how it was \\n\\npossible for such a youth (not particularly intelligent \\n\\ninsofar as he could determine) to manage to find occasions \\n\\nor near-occasions of sin while completely isolated on \\n\\nbarren desert, far from any distraction or apparent source \\n\\nof temptation. There should be very little trouble a boy \\n\\ncould get into out here, armed as he was with only a \\n\\nto Father Cheroki. But this confession was taking up quite \\n\\na lot of time; he wished the boy would get on with it. His \\n\\narthritis was bothering him again, but because of the \\n\\npresence of the Holy Sacrament on the portable table \\n\\nwhich he took with him on his rounds, the priest preferred \\n\\nto stand, or to stay on his knees along with the penitent. \\n\\nHe had lighted a candle before the small golden case which \\n\\ncontained the Hosts, but the flame was invisible in the \\n\\nsunglare, and the breeze might even have blown it out. \\n\\n\"But exorcism is permissible these days, without any \\n\\nspecific higher authorization. What are you confessing– \\n\\nbeing angry?\" \\n\\n\"That too.\"  \\n\\n\"At whom did you become angry? At the old man– or at  \\n\\nyourself for almost taking the food?\"  \\n\\n\"I– I\\'m not sure.\"  \\n\\n\"Well, make up your mind,\" Father Cheroki said  \\n\\nimpatiently. \"Either accuse yourself, or else not.\"  \\n\\n\"I accuse myself.\"  \\n\\n\"Of what?\" Cheroki sighed.  \\n\\n\"Of abusing a sacramental in a fit of temper.\"  \\n\\n\"Abusing\\'? You had no rational reason to suspect diabolic  \\n\\ninfluence? You just became angry and squirted him with it?  \\n\\nLike throwing the ink in his eye?\"  \\n\\nThe novice squirmed and hesitated, sensing the priest\\'s  \\n\\nsarcasm. Confession was always difficult for Brother  \\n\\nFrancis. He could never find the right words for his \\n\\nmisdeeds, and in trying to remember his own motives, he \\n\\nbecame hopelessly confused. Nor was the priest helping \\n\\nmatters by taking the \"either-you-did-or-else-you-didn\\'t\" \\n\\nstand– even though, obviously, either Francis had or else \\n\\nhe hadn\\'t. \\n\\n\"I think I lost my senses for a moment,\" he said finally. \\n\\nCheroki opened his mouth, apparently meaning to pursue \\n\\nthe matter, then thought better of it. \"I see. What next, \\n\\nthen?\" \\n\\n\"Gluttonous thoughts,\" Francis said after a moment. \\n\\nThe priest sighed. \"I thought we were through with that. \\n\\nOr is this another time?\" \\n\\n\"Yesterday. There was this lizard, Father. It had blue and \\n\\nyellow stripes, and such magnificent hams– thick as your \\n\\nthumb and plump, and I kept thinking how it would taste \\n\\nlike chicken, roasted all brown and crisp outside, and– \" \\n\\n\"All right,\" the priest interrupted. Only a hint of revulsion \\n\\ncrossed his aged face. After all, the boy was spending a lot \\n\\nof time in the sun. \"You took pleasure in these thoughts? \\n\\nYou didn\\'t try to get rid of the temptation?\" \\n\\nFrancis reddened. \"I– I tried to catch it. It got away.\"  \\n\\n\"So, not merely thought– deed as well. Just that one  \\n\\ntime?\"  \\n\\n\"Well– yes, just that.\"  \\n\\n\"All right, in thought and deed, willfully meaning to eat  \\n\\nmeat during Lent. Please be as specific as you can after  \\n\\nthis. I thought you had examined your conscience  \\n\\nproperly. Is there anything else?\"  \\n\\n\"Quite a lot.\"  \\n\\nThe priest winced. He had several hermitages to visit; it  \\n\\nwas a long hot ride, and his knees were hurting. \"Please  \\n\\nget on with it as quickly as you can,\" he sighed.  \\n\\n\"Impurity, once.\"  \\n\\n\"Thought, word, or deed?\"  \\n\\n\"Well, there was this succubus, and she– \" \\n\\n\"Succubus? Oh– nocturnal. You were asleep?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, but– \" \\n\\n\"Then why confess it?\" \\n\\n\"Because afterwards.\" \\n\\n\"Afterwards what? When you woke up?\" \\n\\n\"Yes. I kept thinking about her. Kept imagining it all over \\n\\nagain.\" \\n\\n\"All right, concupiscent thought, deliberately entertained. \\n\\nYou\\'re sorry? Now, what next?\" \\n\\nAll this was the usual sort of thing that one kept hearing \\n\\ntime after endless time from postulant after postulant, \\n\\nnovice after novice, and it seemed to Father Cheroki that \\n\\nthe least Brother Francis could do would be to bark out his \\n\\nself-accusations one, two, three, in a neat orderly manner, \\n\\nwithout all this prodding and prompting. Francis seemed to \\n\\nfind difficulty in formulating whatever he was about to say; \\n\\nthe priest waited.  \\n\\n\"I think my vocation has come to me, Father, but– \" \\n\\nFrancis moistened his cracked lips and stared at a bug on a \\n\\nrock. \\n\\n\"Oh, has it?\" Cheroki\\'s voice was toneless. \\n\\n\"Yes, I think– but would it be a sin, Father, if when I first \\n\\ngot it, I thought rather scornfully of the handwriting? I \\n\\nmean?\" \\n\\nCheroki blinked. Handwriting? Vocation? What kind of a \\n\\nfor a few seconds, then frowned. \\n\\n\"Have you and Brother Alfred been passing notes to each \\n\\nother?\" he asked ominously. \\n\\n\"Oh, no, Father!\" \\n\\n\"Then whose handwriting are you talking about?\" \\n\\n\"The Blessed Leibowitz.\" \\n\\nCheroki paused to think. Did there, or did there not, exist \\n\\nin the abbey\\'s collection of ancient documents, any \\n\\nmanuscript penned personally by the founder of the \\n\\nOrder?– an original copy? After a moment\\'s reflection, he \\n\\ndecided in the affirmative; yes, there were a few scraps of \\n\\nit left, carefully kept under lock and key. \\n\\n\"Are you talking about something that happened back at \\n\\nthe abbey? Before you came out here?\" \\n\\n\"No, Father. It happened right over there– \" He nodded \\n\\ntoward the left. \"Three mounds over, near the tall cactus.\" \\n\\n\"Involving your vocation, you say?\" \\n\\n\"Y-yes, but– \" \\n\\n\"Of course,\" Cheroki said sharply, \"you could NOT \\n\\nPOSSIBLY be trying to say that– you have received– from \\n\\nthe Blessed Leibowitz, dead now, lo, the last six hundred \\n\\nyears– a handwritten invitation to profess your solemn \\n\\nvows? And you, uh, deplored his handwriting?– Forgive \\n\\nme, but that\\'s the impression I was getting.\" \\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s something like that, Father.\"  \\n\\nCheroki sputtered. Becoming alarmed, Brother Francis \\n\\nproduced a scrap of paper from his sleeve and handed it to \\n\\nthe priest. It was brittle with age and stained. The ink was \\n\\nfaded. \\n\\n\"Pound pastrami,\" Father Cheroki pronounced, slurring \\n\\nover some of the unfamiliar words, \"can kraut, six bagels– \\n\\nbring home for Emma.\" He stared fixedly at Brother \\n\\nFrancis for several seconds. \"This was written by whom?\" \\n\\nFrancis told him. \\n\\nCheroki thought it over. \"It\\'s not possible for you to make \\n\\na good confession while you\\'re in this condition. And it \\n\\nwouldn\\'t be proper for me to absolve you when you\\'re not \\n\\nin your right mind.\" Seeing Francis wince, the priest \\n\\ntouched him reassuringly on the shoulder. \"Don\\'t worry, \\n\\nson, we\\'ll talk it over after you\\'re better. I\\'ll hear your \\n\\nconfession then. For the present– \" He glanced nervously \\n\\nat the vessel containing the Eucharist. \"I want you to \\n\\ngather up your things and return to the abbey at once.\" \\n\\n\"But, Father, I– \" \\n\\n\"I command you,\" the priest said tonelessly, \"to return to  \\n\\nthe abbey at once.\"  \\n\\n\"Y-yes, Father.\" \\n\\n\"Now, I\\'m not going to absolve you, but you might make a \\n\\ngood act of contrition and offer two decades of the rosary \\n\\nas penance anyhow. Would you like my blessing?\" \\n\\nThe novice nodded, fighting tears. The priest blessed him, \\n\\narose, genuflected before the Sacrament, recovered the \\n\\ngolden vessel, and reattached it to the chain around his \\n\\nneck. Having pocketed the candle, collapsed the table, and \\n\\nstrapped it in place behind the saddle, he gave Francis a \\n\\nlast solemn nod, then mounted and rode away on his mare \\n\\nto complete his circuit of the Lenten hermitages. Francis \\n\\nsat in the hot sand and wept. \\n\\nto the crypt to show him the ancient room, if he could \\n\\nhave displayed the box and all its contents, and the mark \\n\\nthe pilgrim had made on the rock. But the priest was \\n\\ncarrying the Eucharist, and could not have been induced to \\n\\nclimb down into a rock-filled basement on his hands and \\n\\nknees, or to paw through the contents of the old box and \\n\\nenter into archaeological discussions; Francis had known \\n\\nbetter than to ask. Cheroki\\'s visit was necessarily solemn, \\n\\nas long as the locket he was wearing contained a single \\n\\nHost; although, after it was empty, he might be amenable \\n\\nto some informal listening. The novice could not blame \\n\\nFather Cheroki for leaping to the conclusion that he had \\n\\ngone out of his mind. He was a little groggy from the sun, \\n\\nand he had stammered quite a bit. More than one novice \\n\\nhad turned up with addled wits after a vocational vigil. \\n\\nThere was nothing to do but obey the command to return. \\n\\nHe walked to the shelter and glanced into it once again, to \\n\\nreassure himself that it was really there; then he went to \\n\\nget the box. By the time he had it repacked and was ready \\n\\nto leave, the dust plume had appeared in the southeast, \\n\\nheralding the arrival of the supply carrier with water and \\n\\ncorn from the abbey. Brother Francis decided to wait for \\n\\nhis supplies before starting the long trek home. \\n\\nThree donkeys and one monk ambled into view at the head \\n\\nof the dust streamer. The lead donkey plodded under the \\n\\nweight of Brother Fingo. In spite of the hood, Francis \\n\\nrecognized the cook\\'s helper from his hunched shoulders \\n\\nand from the long hairy shins that dangled on either side \\n\\nof the donkey so that Brother Fingo\\'s sandals nearly \\n\\ndragged the ground. The animals that followed came \\n\\nloaded with small bags of corn and skins of water. \\n\\n\"Sooooee pig-pig-pig! Sooee pig!\" Fingo called, cupping his \\n\\nhands to his mouth and broadcasting the hog-call across \\n\\nthe ruins as if he had not seen Francis waiting for him \\n\\nbeside the trail. \"Pig pig pig!– Oh, there you are, \\n\\nFrancisco! I mistook you for a bone pile. Well, we\\'ll have to \\n\\nfatten you up for the wolves. There you are, help yourself \\n\\nto the Sunday slops. How goes the hermit trade? Think \\n\\nyou\\'ll make it a career? Just one waterskin, mind you, and \\n\\none sack of corn. And watch Malicia\\'s hind feet; she\\'s in rut \\n\\nand feels frolicky– kicked Alfred back there, crunch! right \\n\\nin the kneecap. Careful with it!\" Brother Fingo brushed \\n\\nback his hood and chortled while the novice and Malicia \\n\\nfenced for position. Fingo was undoubtedly the ugliest man \\n\\nalive, and when he laughed, the vast display of pink gums \\n\\nand huge teeth of assorted colors added little to his charm; \\n\\nhe was a sport, but the sport could scarcely be called \\n\\nmonstrous; it was a rather common hereditary pattern in \\n\\nthe Minnesota country from whence he came; it produced \\n\\nbaldness and a very uneven distribution of melanin, so \\n\\nthat the gangling monk\\'s hide was a patchwork of \\n\\nbeef-liver and chocolate splashes on an albino background. \\n\\nHowever, his perpetual good humor so compensated for \\n\\nhis appearance that one ceased to notice it after a few \\n\\nminutes; and after long acquaintance, Brother Fingo\\'s \\n\\nmarkings seemed as normal as those of a painted pony. \\n\\nWhat might have seemed hideous if he were a sulking \\n\\nfellow, managed almost to become as decorative as \\n\\nclown\\'s make-up when accompanied by exuberant good \\n\\nprobably temporary. He was a woodcarver by trade, and \\n\\nnormally worked in the carpenter\\'s shop. But some \\n\\nincident of self-assertion, in connection with a figure of the \\n\\nBlessed Leibowitz which he had been permitted to carve, \\n\\nhad caused the abbot to order him transferred to the \\n\\nkitchen until he showed some signs of practicing humility. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the figure of the Beatus waited in the carpentry \\n\\nshop, half-carved. \\n\\nFingo\\'s grin began to fade as he studied Francis\\' \\n\\ncountenance while the novice unloaded his grain and water \\n\\nfrom the frisky she-ass. \"You look like a sick sheep, boy,\" \\n\\nhe said to the penitent. \"What\\'s the trouble? Is Father \\n\\nCheroki in one of his slow rages again?\" \\n\\nBrother Francis shook his head. \"Not that I could tell.\" \\n\\n\"Then what\\'s wrong? Are you really sick?\"  \\n\\n\"He ordered me back to the abbey.\"  \\n\\n\"Wha-a-at?\" Fingo swung a hairy shin over the jackass and \\n\\ndropped a few inches to the ground. He towered over \\n\\nBrother Francis, clapped a meaty hand on his shoulder, \\n\\nand peered down into his face. \"What is it, the jaundice?\" \\n\\n\"No. He thinks I\\'m– \" Francis tapped his temple and \\n\\nshrugged. Fingo laughed. \"Well, that\\'s true, but we all \\n\\nknew that. Why is he sending you back?\" \\n\\nFrancis glanced down at the box near his feet. \"I found \\n\\nsome things that belonged to the Blessed Leibowitz. I \\n\\nstarted to tell him, but he didn\\'t believe me. He wouldn\\'t \\n\\nlet me explain. He– \" \\n\\n\"You found what?\" Fingo smiled his disbelief, then dropped \\n\\nto his knees and opened the box while the novice watched \\n\\ntrays with one finger and whistled softly. \"Hill-pagan \\n\\ncharms, aren\\'t they? This is old, Francisco, this is really \\n\\nold.\" He glanced at the note in the lid. \"What\\'s this \\n\\ngibberish?\" he asked, squinting up at the unhappy novice. \\n\\n\"Pre-Deluge English.\"  \\n\\n\"I never studied it, except what we sing in choir.\" \\n\\n\"It was written by the Beatus himself.\" \\n\\n\"This?\" Brother Fingo stared from the note to Brother \\n\\nFrancis and back to the note. He shook his head suddenly, \\n\\nclamped the lid back on the box, and stood up. His grin \\n\\nhad become artificial. \"Maybe Father\\'s right. You better \\n\\nhike back and have Brother Pharmacist brew you up one of \\n\\nhis toad-stool specials. That\\'s the fever, Brother.\" \\n\\nFrancis shrugged. \"Perhaps.\" \\n\\n\"Where did you find this stuff?\" \\n\\nThe novice pointed. \"Over that way a few mounds. I \\n\\nmoved some rocks. There was a cave-in, and I found a \\n\\nbasement. Go see for yourself.\" \\n\\nFingo shook his head. \"I\\'ve got a long ride ahead.\" \\n\\nFrancis picked up the box and started toward the abbey \\n\\nwhile Fingo returned to his donkey, but after a few paces \\n\\nthe novice stopped and called back. \\n\\n\"Brother Spots– could you take two minutes?\" \\n\\n\"Maybe,\" answered Fingo. \"What for?\" \\n\\n\"Just walk over there and look in the hole.\" \\n\\n\"Why?\" \\n\\n\"So you can tell Father Cheroki if it\\'s really there.\" \\n\\nFingo paused with one leg half across his donkey\\'s back. \\n\\n\"Ha!\" He withdrew the leg. \"All right. If it\\'s not there, I\\'ll \\n\\ntell you.\" \\n\\nFrancis watched for a moment while the gangling Fingo \\n\\nstrode out of sight among the mounds; then he turned to \\n\\nshuffle down the long dusty trail toward the abbey, \\n\\nintermittently munching corn and sipping from the \\n\\nwaterskin. Occasionally he glanced back. Fingo was gone \\n\\nmuch longer than two minutes. Brother Francis had ceased \\n\\nto watch for his reappearance by the time he heard a \\n\\ndistant bellow from the ruins far behind him. He turned. He \\n\\ncould make out the distant figure of the woodcarver \\n\\nstanding atop one of the mounds. Fingo was waving his \\n\\narms and vigorously nodding his head in affirmation. \\n\\nFrancis waved back, then hiked wearily on his way.  \\n\\nTwo weeks of near-starvation had exacted their tribute. \\n\\nAfter two or three miles he began to stagger. When still \\n\\nnearly a mile from the abbey, he fainted beside the road. \\n\\nIt was late afternoon before Cheroki, riding back from his \\n\\nrounds, noticed him lying there, hastily dismounted, and \\n\\nbathed the youth\\'s face until he gradually brought him \\n\\naround. Cheroki had encountered the supply donkeys on \\n\\nhis way back and had paused to hear Fingo\\'s account, \\n\\nconfirming Brother Francis\\' find. Although he was not \\n\\nprepared to believe that Francis had discovered anything \\n\\nof real importance, the priest regretted his earlier \\n\\nimpatience with the boy. Having noticed the box lying \\n\\nnearby with its contents halfspilled in the road, and having \\n\\nglanced briefly at the note in the lid, while Francis sat \\n\\ngroggy and confused at the edge of the trail, Cheroki found \\n\\nhimself willing to regard the boy\\'s earlier babblings as the \\n\\nresult of romantic imagination rather than of madness or \\n\\ndelirium. He had neither visited the crypt nor closely \\n\\nexamined the contents of the box, but it was obvious, at \\n\\nleast, that the boy had been misinterpreting real events \\n\\nrather than confessing hallucinations. \\n\\n\"You can finish your confession as soon as we get back,\" \\n\\nthe saddle on the mare. \"I think I can absolve you if you \\n\\ndon\\'t insist on personal messages from the saints. Eh?\" \\n\\nBrother Francis was too weak at the moment to insist on \\n\\nanything. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Four  \\n\\n\"You did the right thing,\" the abbot grunted at last. He had \\n\\nbeen slowly pacing the floor of his study for perhaps five \\n\\nminutes, his wide peasant face wearing a thick-furrowed \\n\\nmuscular glower, while Father Cheroki sat nervously on the \\n\\nedge of his chair. Neither priest had spoken since Cheroki \\n\\nhad entered the room in answer to his ruler\\'s summons; \\n\\nCheroki jumped slightly when Abbot Arkos finally grunted \\n\\nout the words. \\n\\n\"You did the right thing,\" the abbot said again, stopping in \\n\\nthe center of the room and squinting at his prior, who \\n\\nfinally began to relax. It was nearly midnight and Arkos \\n\\nhad been preparing to retire for an hour or two of sleep \\n\\nbefore Matins and Lauds. Still damp and disheveled from a \\n\\nrecent plunge in the bathing barrel, he reminded Cheroki \\n\\nof a were-bear only incompletely changed into a man. He \\n\\nwas wearing a coyote-skin robe, and the only hint of his \\n\\noffice was the pectoral cross that nestled in the black fur \\n\\non his chest and flashed with candlelight whenever he \\n\\nturned toward the desk. His wet hair hung over his \\n\\nforehead, and with his short jutting beard and his coyote \\n\\nskins, he looked, at the moment, less like a priest than a \\n\\nmilitary chieftain, full of restrained battleanger from a \\n\\nrecent assault. Father Cheroki, who came of baronial stock \\n\\nfrom Denver, tended to react formally to men\\'s official \\n\\ncapacities, tended to speak courteously to the badge of \\n\\noffice while not allowing himself to see the man who wore \\n\\nit, in this respect following the Court customs of many \\n\\nages. Thus Father Cheroki had always maintained a \\n\\nformally cordial relationship with the ring and the pectoral \\n\\ncross, with the office, of his abbot, but permitted himself \\n\\nto see as little as possible of Aikos the man. This was \\n\\nrather difficult under present circumstances, the Reverend \\n\\nFather Abbot being fresh out of his bath, and padding \\n\\ntrimmed a corn and cut too deep; one great toe was \\n\\nbloody. Cheroki tried to avoid noticing it, but felt very ill at \\n\\nease. \\n\\n\"You do know what I\\'m talking about?\" Aikos growled \\n\\nimpatiently. \\n\\nCheroki hesitated. \"Would you mind, Father Abbot, being \\n\\nspecific– in case it\\'s connected with something I might \\n\\nhave heard about only in confession?\" \\n\\n\"Hah? Oh! Well, I\\'m bedeviled! You did hear his confession, \\n\\nI clean forgot. Well, get him to tell you again, so you can \\n\\ntalk– though Heaven knows, it\\'s all over the abbey \\n\\nanyhow. No, don\\'t go see him now. I\\'ll tell you, and don\\'t \\n\\nanswer on whatever\\'s sealed. You\\'ve seen that stuff?\" \\n\\nAbbot Arkos waved toward his desk where the contents of \\n\\nBrother Francis\\' box had been emptied for examination. \\n\\nCheroki nodded slowly. \"He dropped it beside the road \\n\\nwhen he fell. I helped gather it up, but I didn\\'t look at it \\n\\ncarefully.\" \\n\\n\"Well, you know what he claims it is?\" \\n\\nFather Cheroki glanced aside. He seemed not to hear the \\n\\nquestion. \\n\\n\"All right, all right,\" the abbot growled, \"never mind what \\n\\nhe claims it is. Just go look it over carefully yourself and \\n\\ndecide what you think it is.\" \\n\\nCheroki went to bend over the desk and scrutinize the \\n\\npapers carefully, one at a time, while the abbot paced and \\n\\nkept talking, seemingly to the priest but half to himself. \\n\\n\"It\\'s impossible! You did the right thing to send him back \\n\\nbefore he uncovered more. But of course that\\'s not the \\n\\nworst part. The worst part is the old man he babbles \\n\\nabout. It\\'s getting too thick. I don\\'t know anything that \\n\\ncould damage the case worse than a whole flood of \\n\\nimprobable \\'miracles.\\' A few real incidents, certainly! It has \\n\\nto be established that the intercession of the Beatus has \\n\\noccur. But there can be too much! Look at the Blessed \\n\\nChang– beatified two centuries ago, but never canonized– \\n\\nso far. And why? His Order got too eager, that\\'s why. \\n\\nEvery time somebody got over a cough, it was a \\n\\nmiraculous cure by the Beatus. Visions in the basement, \\n\\nevocations in the belfry; it sounded more like a collection \\n\\nof ghost stories than a list of miraculous incidents. Maybe \\n\\ntwo or three incidents were really valid, but when there\\'s \\n\\nthat much chaff– well?\" \\n\\nFather Cheroki looked up. His knuckles had whitened on \\n\\nthe edge of the desk and his face seemed strained. He \\n\\nseemed not to have been listening. \"I beg your pardon, \\n\\nFather Abbot?\" \\n\\n\"Well, the same thing could happen here, that\\'s what,\" \\n\\nsaid the abbot, and resumed his slow padding to and fro. \\n\\n\"Last year there was Brother Noyon and his miraculous \\n\\nhangman\\'s noose. Ha! And the year before that, Brother \\n\\nSmirnov gets mysteriously cured of the gout– how?– by \\n\\ntouching a probable relic of our Blessed Leibowitz, the \\n\\nyoung louts say. And now this Francis, he meets a pilgrim– \\n\\nwearing what?– wearing for a kilt the very burlap cloth \\n\\nthey hooded Blessed Leibowitz with before they hanged \\n\\nhim. And with what for a belt? A rope. What rope? Ahh, \\n\\nthe very same– \" He paused, looking at Cheroki. \"I can tell \\n\\nby your blank look that you haven\\'t heard this yet? No? All \\n\\nright, so you can\\'t say. No, no, Francis didn\\'t say that. All \\n\\nhe said was– \" Abbot Arkos tried to inject a slightly falsetto \\n\\nquality into his normally gruff voice. \"All Brother Francis \\n\\nsaid was – \\'I met a little old man, and I thought he was a \\n\\npilgrim heading for the abbey because he was going that \\n\\nway, and he was wearing an old burlap sack tied around \\n\\nwith a piece of rope. And he made a mark on the rock, and \\n\\nthe mark looked like this.\" \\n\\nArkos produced a scrap of parchment from the pocket of \\n\\nhis fur robe and held it up toward Cheroki\\'s face in the \\n\\ncandle-glow. Still trying, with only slight success, to \\n\\nimitate Brother Francis: \"\\'And I couldn\\'t figure out what it \\n\\nmeant. Do you know?\" \\n\\nCheroki stared at the symbols ** and shook his head. \\n\\n\"That\\'s what Francis said. I didn\\'t know either.\" \\n\\n\"You do now?\" \\n\\n\"I do now. Somebody looked it up. That is a lamedh, and \\n\\nthat is a sadhe. Hebrew letters.\" \\n\\n\"Sadhe lamedh?\" \\n\\n\"No. Right to left. Lamedh sadhe. An ell, and a tee-ess \\n\\nsound. If it had vowel marks, it might be \\'loots,\\' \\'lots,\\' \\n\\n\\'lets,\\' \\'lets,\\' \\'latz,\\' \\'litz\\'– anything like that. If it had some \\n\\nletters between those two, it might sound like Lllll– \\n\\nguess-who.\" \\n\\n\"Leibo– Ho, no!\" \\n\\n\"Ho, yes! Brother Francis didn\\'t think of it. Somebody else \\n\\nthought of it. Brother Francis didn\\'t think of the burlap \\n\\nhood and the hangman\\'s rope; one of his chums did. So \\n\\nwhat happens? By tonight, the whole novitiate is buzzing \\n\\nwith the sweet little story that Francis met the Beatus \\n\\nhimself out there, and the Beatus escorted our boy over to \\n\\nwhere that stuff was and told him he\\'d find his vocation.\" \\n\\nA perplexed frown crossed Cheroki\\'s face. \"Did Brother \\n\\nFrancis say that?\" \\n\\nthe rascal! But he tells it sweet-and-simple, rather \\n\\nstupidly, in fact, and lets the others read in the meanings. \\n\\nI haven\\'t talked to him myself. I sent the Rector of the \\n\\nMemorabilia to get his story.\" \\n\\n\"I think I\\'d better talk to Brother Francis,\" Cheroki \\n\\nmurmured. \\n\\n\"Do! When you first came in, I was still wondering whether \\n\\nto roast you alive or not. For sending him in, I mean. If \\n\\nyou had let him stay out there on the desert, we wouldn\\'t \\n\\nhave this fantastic twaddle going around. But, on the other \\n\\nhand, if he\\'d stayed out there, there\\'s no telling what else \\n\\nhe might have dug out of that cellar. I think you did the \\n\\nright thing, to send him in.\" \\n\\nCheroki, who had made the decision on no such basis, \\n\\nfound silence to be the appropriate policy. \\n\\n\"See him,\" growled the abbot. \"Then send him to me.\"  \\n\\nIt was about nine on a bright Monday morning when \\n\\nBrother Francis rapped timidly at the door of the abbot\\'s \\n\\nstudy. A good night\\'s sleep on the hard straw pallet in his \\n\\nold familiar cell, plus a small bite of unfamiliar breakfast, \\n\\nhad not perhaps done any wonders for starved tissue or \\n\\nentirely cleared the sun-daze from his brain, but these \\n\\nrelative luxuries had at least restored him to sufficient \\n\\nclarity of mind to perceive that he had cause to be afraid. \\n\\nHe was, in fact, terrified, so that his first tap at the abbot\\'s \\n\\nseveral minutes, he mustered the courage to knock again. \\n\\n\"Benedicamus Domino.\" \\n\\n\"Deo? gratias?\" asked Francis. \\n\\n\"Come in, my boy, come in!\" called an affable voice, \\n\\nwhich, after some seconds of puzzling, he recognized with \\n\\namazement to have been that of his sovereign abbot. \\n\\n\"You twist the little knob, my son,\" said the same friendly \\n\\nvoice after Brother Francis had stood frozen on the spot for \\n\\nsome seconds, with his knuckles still in position for \\n\\nknocking. \\n\\n\"Y-y-yes– \" Francis scarcely touched the knob, but it \\n\\nseemed that the accursed door opened anyway; he had \\n\\nhoped that it would be tightly stuck. \\n\\n\"The Lord Abbot s-s-sent for– me?\" squawked the novice. \\n\\nAbbot Arkos pursed his lips and nodded slowly. \\n\\n\"Mmmm-yes, the Lord Abbot sent for– you. Do come in \\n\\nand shut the door.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis got the door closed and stood shivering in \\n\\nthe center of the room. The abbot was toying with some of \\n\\nthe wirewhiskered things from the old toolbox. \\n\\n\"Or perhaps it would be more fitting,\" said Abbot Arkos, \"if \\n\\nthe Reverend Father Abbot were sent for by you. Now that \\n\\nyou have been so favored by Providence and have become \\n\\nso famous, eh?\" He smiled soothingly. \\n\\n\"Heh heh?\" Brother Francis laughed inquiringly. \"Oh \\n\\nn-n-no, m\\'Lord.\" \\n\\n\"You do not dispute that you have won overnight fame? \\n\\nThat Providence elected you to discover THIS– \" he \\n\\ngestured sweepingly at the relics spread on the desk \"– \\n\\nthis JUNK box, as its previous owner no doubt rightly  \\n\\ncalled it?\"  \\n\\nThe novice stammered helplessly, and somehow managed  \\n\\nto wind up wearing a grin.  \\n\\n\"You are seventeen and plainly an idiot, are you not?\"  \\n\\n\"That is undoubtedly true, m\\'Lord Abbot.\"  \\n\\n\"What excuse do you propose for believing yourself called  \\n\\nto Religion?\"  \\n\\n\"No excuse, Magister meus.\"  \\n\\n\"Ah? So? Then you feel that you have no vocation to the  \\n\\nOrder?\"  \\n\\n\"Oh, I do!\" the novice gasped.  \\n\\n\"But you propose no excuse?\"  \\n\\n\"None.\"  \\n\\n\"You little cretin, I am asking your reason. Since you state  \\n\\nnone, I take it you are prepared to deny that you met \\n\\nanyone in the desert the other day, that you stumbled on \\n\\nbeen hearing from others is only– feverish raving?\" \\n\\n\"Oh, no, Dom Arkos!\" \\n\\n\"Oh, no, what?\" \\n\\n\"I cannot deny what I saw with my own eyes, Reverend \\n\\nFather.\" \\n\\n\"So, you did meet an angel– or was it a saint?– or perhaps \\n\\nnot yet a saint?– and he showed you where to look?\" \\n\\n\"I never said he was– \" \\n\\n\"And this is your excuse for believing yourself to have a \\n\\ntrue vocation, is it not? That this, this– shall we call him a \\n\\n\\'creature\\'?– spoke to you of finding a voice, and marked a \\n\\nrock with his initials, and told you it was what you were \\n\\nlooking for, and when you looked under it– there THIS \\n\\nwas. Eh?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, Dom Arkos.\" \\n\\n\"What is your opinion of your own execrable vanity?\"  \\n\\n\"My execrable vanity is unpardonable, m\\'Lord\\'n\\'Teacher.\" \\n\\n\"To imagine yourself important enough to be unpardonable \\n\\nis an even vaster vanity,\" roared the sovereign of the \\n\\nabbey. \\n\\n\"M\\'Lord, I am indeed a worm.\" \\n\\n\"Very well, you need only deny the part about the pilgrim. \\n\\nNo one else saw such a person, you know. I understand he \\n\\nwas supposed to have been headed in this direction? That \\n\\nhe even said he might stop here? That he inquired about \\n\\nthe abbey? Yes? And where would he have disappeared to, \\n\\nif he ever existed? No such person came past here. The \\n\\nbrother on duty at that time in the watchtower didn\\'t see \\n\\nhim. Eh? Are you now ready to admit that you imagined \\n\\nhim?\" \\n\\n\"If there are not really two marks on that rock where he– \\n\\nthen maybe I might– \" \\n\\nThe abbot closed his eyes and sighed wearily. \"The marks \\n\\nare there– faintly,\" he admitted. \"You might have made \\n\\nthem yourself.\"  \\n\\n\"No, m\\'Lord.\"  \\n\\n\"Will you admit that you imagined the old creature?\"  \\n\\n\"No, m\\'Lord.\"  \\n\\n\"Very well, do you know what is going to happen to you  \\n\\nnow?\"  \\n\\n\"Yes, Reverend Father.\"  \\n\\n\"Then prepare to take it.\"  \\n\\nTrembling, the novice gathered up his habit about his waist  \\n\\nand bent over the desk. The abbot withdrew a stout \\n\\nhickory ruler from the drawer, tested it on his palm, then \\n\\n\"Deo gratias!\" the novice dutifully responded, gasping  \\n\\nslightly.  \\n\\n\"Care to change your mind, my boy?\"  \\n\\n\"Reverend Father, I can\\'t deny– \" \\n\\nWHACK! \\n\\n\"Deo gratias!\" \\n\\nWHACK! \\n\\n\"Deo gratias!\" \\n\\nTen times was this simple but painful litany repeated, with \\n\\nBrother Francis yelping his thanks to Heaven for each \\n\\nscorching lesson in the virtue of humility, as he was \\n\\nexpected to do. The abbot paused after the tenth whack. \\n\\nBrother Francis was on tiptoe and bouncing slightly. Tears \\n\\nsqueezed from the corners of clenched eyelids. \\n\\n\"My dear Brother Francis,\" said the Abbot Arkos, \"are you \\n\\nquite sure you saw the old man?\" \\n\\n\"certain,\" he squeaked, steeling himself for more. \\n\\nAbbot Arkos glanced clinically at the youth, then walked \\n\\nround his desk and sat down with a grunt. He glowered for \\n\\na time at the slip of parchment bearing the letters **. \\n\\n\"Who do you suppose he could have been?\" Abbot Arkos \\n\\nmuttered absently. \\n\\nBrother Francis opened his eyes, causing a brief shed of \\n\\nwater. \\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'ve convinced me, boy, worse luck for you.\" \\n\\nFrancis said nothing, but prayed silently that the need to \\n\\nconvince his sovereign of his veracity would not often \\n\\narise. In response to an irritable gesture from the abbot, \\n\\nhe lowered his tunic. \\n\\n\"You may sit down,\" said the abbot, becoming casual if not \\n\\ngenial. \\n\\nFrancis moved toward the indicated chair, lowered himself \\n\\nhalfway into it, but then winced and stood up again. \"If it\\'s \\n\\nall the same to the Reverend Father Abbot– \" \\n\\n\"All right, then stand. I won\\'t keep you long anyhow. \\n\\nYou\\'re to go out and finish your vigil.\" He paused, noticing \\n\\nthe novice\\'s face brighten a little. \"Oh no you don\\'t!\" he \\n\\nsnapped. \"You\\'re not going back to the same place. You\\'ll \\n\\ntrade hermitages with Brother Alfred, and not go near \\n\\nthose ruins again. Furthermore, I command you not to \\n\\ndiscuss the matter with anyone, except your confessor or \\n\\nwith me, although, Heaven knows, the damage is already \\n\\ndone. Do you know what you\\'ve started?\" \\n\\nBrother Francis shook his head. \"Yesterday being Sunday, \\n\\nat recreation I just answered the fellows\\' questions. I \\n\\nthought– \" \\n\\n\"Well, your fellows have cooked up a very cute \\n\\nexplanation, dear son. Did you know that it was the \\n\\nBlessed Leibowitz himself you met out there?\" \\n\\nFrancis looked blank for a moment, then shook his head \\n\\nagain. \"Oh, no, m\\'Lord Abbot. I\\'m sure it couldn\\'t have \\n\\nbeen. The Blessed Martyr wouldn\\'t do such a thing.\" \\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t do such-a-what thing?\" \\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t chase after somebody and try to hit him with a \\n\\nstick that had a nail in one end.\" \\n\\nThe abbot wiped his mouth to hide an involuntary smile. \\n\\nHe managed to appear thoughtful after a moment. \"Oh, I \\n\\ndon\\'t know about that, now. It was you he was chasing, \\n\\nwasn\\'t it? Yes, I thought so. You told your fellow novices \\n\\nabout that part too? Yes, eh? Well, you see, they didn\\'t \\n\\nthink that would exclude the possibility of his being the \\n\\nBeatus would chase with a stick, but– \" He broke off, \\n\\nunable to suppress laughter at the expression on the \\n\\nnovice\\'s face. \"All right, son– but who do you suppose he \\n\\ncould have been?\" \\n\\n\"I thought perhaps he was a pilgrim on his way to visit our \\n\\nshrine, Reverend Father.\" \\n\\n\"It isn\\'t a shrine yet, and you\\'re not to call it that. And \\n\\nanyway he wasn\\'t, or at least, he didn\\'t. And he didn\\'t pass \\n\\nour gates, unless the watch was asleep. And the novice on \\n\\nwatch denies being asleep, although he admitted feeling \\n\\ndrowsy that day. So what do you suggest?\" \\n\\n\"If the Reverend Father Abbot will forgive me, I\\'ve been on \\n\\nwatch a few times myself.\" \\n\\n\"And?\" \\n\\n\"Well, on a bright day when there\\'s nothing moving but the  \\n\\nbuzzards, after a few hours you just start looking up at the \\n\\nbuzzards.\" \\n\\n\"Oh you do, do you? When you\\'re supposed to be watching \\n\\nthe trail!\" \\n\\n\"And if you stare at the sky too long, you just kind of \\n\\nblank-out– not really asleep, but, sort of, preoccupied.\" \\n\\n\"So that\\'s what you do when you\\'re on watch, do you?\" the \\n\\nabbot growled. \\n\\n\"Not necessarily. I mean, no, Reverend Father, I wouldn\\'t \\n\\nknow it if I had, I don\\'t think. Brother Je– I mean– a \\n\\nbrother I relieved once was like that. He didn\\'t even know \\n\\nit was time for the watch to change. He was just sitting \\n\\nthere in the tower and staring up at the sky with his mouth \\n\\nopen. In a daze.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, and the first time you go stupefied that way, along\\'ll \\n\\ncome a heathen war-party out of the Utah country, kill a \\n\\nfew gardeners, tear up the irrigating system, spoil our \\n\\ncrops, and dump stones in the well before we can start \\n\\ndefending ourselves. Why are you looking so– oh, I forgot– \\n\\nyou were Utah-born before you ran away, weren\\'t you? \\n\\nBut never mind, you could, just possibly, be right about \\n\\nthe watch– how he could have missed seeing the old man, \\n\\nthat is. You\\'re sure he was just an ordinary old man– not \\n\\nanything more? Not an angel? Not a beatus?\" \\n\\nThe novice\\'s gaze drifted ceilingward in thought, then fell \\n\\nquickly to his ruler\\'s face. \"Do angels or saints cast \\n\\nshadows?\" \\n\\n\"Yes– I mean no. I mean– how should I know! He did cast \\n\\na shadow, didn\\'t he?\" \\n\\n\"Well– it was such a small shadow you could hardly see it.\" \\n\\n\"What?\" \\n\\n\"Because it was almost noon.\" \\n\\n\"Imbecile! I\\'m not asking you to tell me what he was. I \\n\\nArkos thumped repeatedly on the table for emphasis. \"I \\n\\nwant to know if you– You!– are sure beyond a doubt that \\n\\nhe was just an ordinary old man!\" \\n\\nThis line of questioning was puzzling to Brother Francis. In \\n\\nhis own mind, there was no neat straight line separating \\n\\nthe Natural from the Supernatural order, but rather, an \\n\\nclearly natural, and there were Things that were clearly \\n\\nsupernatural, but between these extremes was a region of \\n\\nconfusion (his own) – the preternatural– where things \\n\\nmade of mere earth, air, fire, or water tended to behave \\n\\ndisturbingly like Things. For Brother Francis, this region \\n\\nincluded whatever he could see but not understand. And \\n\\nBrother Francis was never \"sure beyond a doubt,\" as the \\n\\nabbot was asking him to be, that he properly understood \\n\\nmuch of anything. Thus, by raising the question at all, \\n\\nAbbot Arkos was unwittingly throwing the novice\\'s pilgrim \\n\\ninto the twilight region, into the same perspective as the \\n\\nold man\\'s first appearance as a legless black strip that \\n\\nwriggled in the midst of a lake of heat illusion on the trail, \\n\\ninto the same perspective as he had occupied momentarily \\n\\nwhen the novice\\'s world had contracted until it contained \\n\\nnothing but a hand offering him a particle of food. If some \\n\\ncreature more-than-human chose to disguise itself as \\n\\nhuman, how was he to penetrate its disguise, or suspect \\n\\nthere was one? If such a creature did not wish to be \\n\\nsuspected, would it not remember to cast a shadow, leave \\n\\nfootprints, eat bread and cheese? Might it not chew \\n\\nspiceleaf, spit at a lizard, and remember to imitate the \\n\\nreaction of a mortal who forgot to put on his sandals \\n\\nbefore stepping on hot ground? Francis was not prepared \\n\\nto estimate the intelligence or ingenuity of hellish or \\n\\nheavenly beings, or to guess the extent of their histrionic \\n\\nhellishly or divinely clever. The abbot, by raising the \\n\\nquestion at all, had formulated the nature of Brother \\n\\nFrancis\\' answer, which was: to entertain the question \\n\\nitself, although he had not previously done so. \\n\\n\"Well, boy?\" \\n\\n\"M\\'Lord Abbot, you don\\'t suppose he might have been– \" \\n\\n\"I\\'m asking you not to suppose. I\\'m asking you to be flatly \\n\\ncertain. Was he, or was he not, an ordinary \\n\\nflesh-and-blood person?\" \\n\\nThe question was frightening. That the question was \\n\\ndignified by coming from the lips of so exalted a person as \\n\\nhis sovereign abbot made it even more frightening, though \\n\\nhe could plainly see that his ruler stated it merely because \\n\\nhe wanted a particular answer. He wanted it rather badly. \\n\\nIf he wanted it that badly, the question must be important. \\n\\nIf the question was important enough for an abbot, then it \\n\\nwrong. \\n\\n\"I– I think he was flesh and blood, Reverend Father, but \\n\\nnot exactly \\'ordinary.\\' In some ways, he was rather \\n\\nextraordinary.\" \\n\\n\"What ways?\" Abbot Arkos asked sharply. \\n\\n\"Like– how straight he could spit. And he could read, I \\n\\nthink.\" The abbot closed his eyes and rubbed his temples \\n\\nin apparent exasperation. How easy it would have been \\n\\nflatly to have told the boy that his pilgrim was only an old \\n\\ntramp of some kind, and then to have commanded him not \\n\\nto think otherwise. But by allowing the boy to see that a \\n\\nquestion was possible, he had rendered such a command \\n\\nineffective before he uttered it. Insofar as thought could be \\n\\ngoverned at all, it could only be commanded to follow what \\n\\nreason affirmed anyhow; command it otherwise, and it \\n\\nwould not obey. Like any wise ruler, Abbot Arkos did not \\n\\nissue orders vainly, when to disobey was possible and to \\n\\nenforce was not possible. It was better to look the other \\n\\nway than to command ineffectually. He had asked a \\n\\nquestion that he himself could not answer by reason, \\n\\nhaving never seen the old man, and had thereby lost the \\n\\nright to make the answer mandatory.  \\n\\n\"Get out,\" he said at last, without opening his eyes.  \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Five  \\n\\nSomewhat mystified by the commotion at the abbey, \\n\\nBrother Francis returned to the desert that same day to \\n\\ncomplete his Lenten vigil in rather wretched solitude. He \\n\\nhad expected some excitement about the relics to arise, \\n\\nbut the excessive interest which everyone had taken in the \\n\\nold wanderer surprised him. Francis had spoken of the old \\n\\nman, simply because of the part he had played, either by \\n\\naccident or by design of Providence, in the monk\\'s \\n\\nstumbling upon the crypt and its relics. The pilgrim was \\n\\nonly a minor ingredient, as far as Francis was concerned, \\n\\nin a mandala design at whose center rested a relic of a \\n\\nsaint. But his fellow novices had seemed more interested \\n\\nin the pilgrim than in the relic, and even the abbot had \\n\\nsummoned him, not to ask about the box, but to ask about \\n\\nthe old man. They had asked him a hundred questions \\n\\nabout the pilgrim to which he could reply only: \"I didn\\'t \\n\\nnotice,\" or \"I wasn\\'t looking right then,\" or \"If he said, I \\n\\ndon\\'t remember,\" and some of the questions were a little \\n\\nweird. And so he questioned himself: Should I have \\n\\nnoticed? Was I stupid not to watch what he did? Wasn\\'t I \\n\\npaying enough attention to what he said? Did I miss \\n\\nsomething important because I was dazed? \\n\\nHe brooded on it in the darkness while the wolves prowled \\n\\nabout his new encampment and filled the nights with their \\n\\nthe day that were assigned as proper for the prayers and \\n\\nspiritual exercises of the vocational vigil, and he confessed \\n\\nas much to Prior Cheroki the next time the priest rode his \\n\\nSunday circuit. \"You shouldn\\'t let the romantic \\n\\nimaginations of the others bother you; you have enough \\n\\ntrouble with your own,\" the priest told him, after chiding \\n\\nhim for neglecting the exercises and prayers. \"They don\\'t \\n\\nthink up questions like that on the basis of what might be \\n\\ntrue; they concoct the questions on the basis of what \\n\\nmight be sensational if it just happened to be true. It\\'s \\n\\nridiculous! I can tell you that the Reverend Father Abbot \\n\\nhas ordered the entire novitiate to drop the subject.\" After \\n\\na moment, he unfortunately added: \"There really wasn\\'t \\n\\nanything about the old man to suggest the supernatural– \\n\\nwas there?\" with only the faintest trace of hopeful wonder \\n\\nin his tone. \\n\\nBrother Francis wondered too. If there had been a \\n\\nsuggestion of the supernatural, he had not noticed it. But \\n\\nthen too, judging by the number of questions he had been \\n\\nunable to answer, he had not noticed very much. The \\n\\nprofusion of the questions had made him feel that his \\n\\nfailure to observe had been, somehow, culpable. He had \\n\\nbecome grateful to the pilgrim upon discovering the \\n\\nshelter. But he had not interpreted events entirely in terms \\n\\nof his own interests, in accordance with his own longing for \\n\\nsome shred of evidence that the dedication of his lifetime \\n\\nto the labors of the monastery was born not so much of his \\n\\nown will as it was of grace, empowering the will, but not \\n\\ncompelling it, rightly to choose. Perhaps the events had a \\n\\nvaster significance that he had missed, during the totality \\n\\nof his self-absorption. \\n\\nWhat is your opinion of your own execrable vanity? \\n\\nMy execrable vanity is like that of the fabled cat who \\n\\nstudied ornithology, m\\'Lord. \\n\\nHis desire to profess his final and perpetual vows– was it \\n\\nnot akin to the motive of the cat who became an \\n\\nornithologist?– so that he might glorify his own \\n\\nornithophagy, esoterically devouring Penthestes atricapillus \\n\\nNature to be an ornithophage, so was Francis called by his \\n\\nown nature hungrily to devour such knowledge as could be \\n\\ntaught in those days, and, because there were no schools \\n\\nbut the monastic schools, he had donned the habit first of \\n\\na postulant, later of a novice. But to suspect that God as \\n\\nwell as Nature had beckoned him to become a professed \\n\\nmonk of the Order? \\n\\nWhat else could he do? There was no returning to his \\n\\na shaman, who would have trained him as his servant and \\n\\nacolyte. Having run away, he could not return, except to \\n\\nmeet grisly tribal \"justice.\" He had stolen a shaman\\'s \\n\\nproperty (Francis\\' own person), and while thievery was an \\n\\nhonorable profession among the Utah, getting caught was \\n\\na capital crime when the thief\\'s victim was the tribal \\n\\nwarlock. Nor would he have cared to lapse back into the \\n\\nrelatively primitive life of an illiterate shepherd people, \\n\\nafter his schooling at the abbey. \\n\\nBut what else? The continent was lightly settled. He \\n\\nthought of the wall-map in the abbey\\'s library, and of the \\n\\nsparse distribution of the crosshatched areas, which were \\n\\nregions– if not of civilization– then of civil order, where \\n\\nsome form of lawful sovereignty, transcending the tribal, \\n\\nheld sway. The rest of the continent was populated, very \\n\\nthinly, by the people of the forest and the plain, who were, \\n\\nfor the most part, not savages, but simple clanfolk loosely \\n\\norganized into small communities here and there, who \\n\\nlived by hunting, gathering, and primitive agriculture, \\n\\nwhose birth rate was barely high enough (discounting \\n\\nprincipal industries of the continent, excepting a few \\n\\nseacoast regions, were hunting, farming, fighting, and \\n\\nwitchcraft– the last being the most promising \"industry\" for \\n\\nprimary ends, maximum wealth and prestige. \\n\\nThe schooling which Francis had been given at the abbey \\n\\nprepared him for nothing which was of practical value in a \\n\\ndark, ignorant, and workaday world, where literacy was \\n\\nnon-existent and a literate youth, therefore, seemed of no \\n\\nworth to a community unless he could also farm, fight, \\n\\nhunt or show some special talent for inter-tribal theft, or \\n\\nfor the divining of water and workable metal. Even in the \\n\\nscattered domains where a form of civil order existed, the \\n\\nfact of Francis\\' literacy would help him not at all, if he must \\n\\nlead a life apart from the Church. It was true that petty \\n\\nbarons sometimes employed a scribe or two, but such \\n\\ncases were rare enough to be negligible, and were as often \\n\\nfilled by monks as by monastery-schooled laymen. \\n\\nThe only demand for scribes and secretaries was created \\n\\nby the Church herself, whose tenuous hierarchic web was \\n\\nstretched across the continent (and occasionally to \\n\\nfar-distant shores, although the diocesans abroad were \\n\\nvirtually autonomous rulers, subject to the Holy See in \\n\\ntheory but seldom in practice, being cut off from New \\n\\nRome less by schism than by oceans not often crossed) \\n\\nand could be held together only by a communication \\n\\nnetwork. The Church had become, quite coincidentally and \\n\\nwithout meaning to be, the only means whereby news was \\n\\ntransmitted from place to place across the continent. If \\n\\nplague came to the northeast, the southwest would soon \\n\\nhear of it, as a coincidental effect of tales told and retold \\n\\nby messengers of the Church, coming and going from New \\n\\nRome. \\n\\nIf the nomadic infiltration in the far northwest threatened a \\n\\nChristian diocese, an encyclical letter might soon be read \\n\\nfrom pulpits far to the south and east, warning of the \\n\\nthreat and extending the apostolic benediction to \"men of \\n\\nany station, so long as they be skilled at arms, who, \\n\\nhaving the means to make the journey, may be piously \\n\\ndisposed to do so, in order to swear fealty to Our beloved \\n\\nson, N., lawful ruler of that place, for such a period of time \\n\\nas may seem necessary for the maintenance of standing \\n\\narmies there for defense of Christians against the \\n\\ngathering heathen horde, whose ruthless savagery is \\n\\nknown to many and who, to Our deepest grief, tortured, \\n\\nmurdered, and devoured those priests of God which We \\n\\nOurselves sent to them with the Word, that they might \\n\\nenter as lambs into the fold of the Lamb, of whose flock on \\n\\nEarth We are the Shepherd; for, while We have never \\n\\nof the darkness may be led into the Light and enter Our \\n\\nrealms in peace (for it is not to be thought that peaceful \\n\\nstrangers should be repelled from a land so vast and \\n\\nempty; nay, they should be welcomed who come \\n\\npeacefully, even should they be strangers to the visible \\n\\nChurch and its Divine Founder, so long as they hearken to \\n\\nthat Natural law which is written in the hearts of all men, \\n\\nbinding them to Christ in spirit, though they be ignorant of \\n\\nHis Name), it is nevertheless meet and fitting and prudent \\n\\nthat Christendom, while praying for peace and the \\n\\nconversion of the heathen, should gird itself for defense in \\n\\nthe Northwest, where the hordes gather and the incidents \\n\\nof heathen savagery have lately increased, and upon each \\n\\nof you, beloved sons, who can bear arms and shall travel \\n\\nto the Northwest to join forces with those who prepare \\n\\nrightfully to defend their lands, homes, and churches, We \\n\\nextend, and hereby bestow, as a sign of Our special \\n\\naffection, the Apostolic Benediction.\" \\n\\nFrancis had thought briefly of going to the northwest, if he \\n\\nfailed to find a vocation to the Order. But, although he was \\n\\nstrong and skillful enough with blade and bow, he was \\n\\nrather short and not very heavy, while– according to \\n\\nrumor– the heathen was nine feet tall. He could not testify \\n\\nas to the truth of the rumor, but saw no reason to think it \\n\\nfalse. \\n\\nBesides dying in battle, there was very little that he could \\n\\nthink of to do with his lifetime– little that seemed worth \\n\\nthe doing– if he could not devote it to the Order. \\n\\nHis certainty of his vocation had not been broken, but only \\n\\nslightly bent, by the scorching administered to him by the \\n\\nabbot, and by the thought of the cat who became an \\n\\nornithologist when called only by Nature to become an \\n\\nornithophage. The thought made him unhappy enough to \\n\\npermit him to be overcome by temptation, so that, on \\n\\nPalm Sunday, with only six days of starvation remaining \\n\\nuntil the end of Lent, Prior Cheroki heard from Francis (or \\n\\nfrom the shriveled and sun-scorched residuum of Francis, \\n\\nwherein the soul remained somehow encysted) a few brief \\n\\ncroaks which constituted what was probably the most \\n\\nsuccinct confession that Francis ever made or Cheroki ever \\n\\nheard:  \\n\\n\"Bless me, Father; I ate a lizard.\"  \\n\\nPrior Cheroki, having for many years been confessor to \\n\\nfasting penitents, found that custom had, with him, as with \\n\\na fabled gravedigger, given it all \"a property of easiness,\" \\n\\nso that he replied with perfect equanimity and not even a \\n\\nblink: \"Was it an abstinence day, and was it artificially \\n\\nprepared?\" \\n\\nHoly Week would have been less lonely than the earlier \\n\\nweeks of Lent, had the hermits not been, by then, past \\n\\ncaring; for some of the Passiontide liturgy was carried \\n\\noutside the abbey walls to touch the penitents at their vigil \\n\\nsites; twice the Eucharist came forth, and on Maundy \\n\\nThursday the abbot himself made the rounds, with Cheroki \\n\\nand thirteen monks, to perform the Mandatum at each \\n\\nhermitage. Abbot Arkos\\' vestments were concealed under \\n\\na cowl, and the lion almost managed to seem humble \\n\\nkitten as he knelt, and washed and kissed the feet of his \\n\\nfasting subjects with maximum economy of movement and \\n\\na minimum of flourish and display, while the others \\n\\nchanted the antiphons. \"Mandatum flovum do vobis: ut \\n\\ndiligatis invicem. . .\" On Good Friday a Procession of the \\n\\nCross brought out a veiled crucifix, stopping at each \\n\\nhermitage to unveil it gradually before the penitent, lifting \\n\\nthe cloth inch by inch for the Adoration, while the monks \\n\\nchanted the Reproaches: \\n\\n\"My people, what have I done to thee? or in what have I \\n\\ngrieved thee? Answer. . . I exalted thee with virtuous \\n\\n.\" \\n\\nAnd then, Holy Saturday. \\n\\nThe monks carried them in one at a time– famished and \\n\\nraving. Francis was thirty pounds lighter and several \\n\\ndegrees weaker than he had been on Ash Wednesday. \\n\\nWhen they set him on his feet in his own cell, he \\n\\nstaggered, and before he reached the bunk, he fell. The \\n\\nbrothers hoisted him into it, bathed him, shaved him, and \\n\\nanointed his blistered skin, while Francis babbled \\n\\ndeliriously about something in a burlap loincloth, \\n\\naddressing it at times as an angel and again as a saint, \\n\\nfrequently invoking the name of Leibowitz and trying to \\n\\napologize. \\n\\nHis brethren, forbidden by the abbot to speak of the  \\n\\nmatter, merely exchanged significant glances or nodded \\n\\nmysteriously among themselves. \\n\\nReports filtered to the abbot.  \\n\\n\"Bring him here,\" he grunted at a recorder, as soon as he  \\n\\nheard that Francis could walk. His tone sent the recorder  \\n\\nscurrying.  \\n\\n\"Do you deny saying these things?\" Arkos growled.  \\n\\n\"I don\\'t remember saying them, m\\'Lord Abbot,\" said the  \\n\\nnovice, eying the abbot\\'s ruler. \"I may have been raving.\"  \\n\\n\"Assuming that you were raving– would you say it again  \\n\\nnow?\"  \\n\\n\"About the pilgrim being the Beatus? Oh, no, Magister  \\n\\nmeus!\"  \\n\\n\"Then assert the contrary.\"  \\n\\n\"I don\\'t think the pilgrim was the Beatus.\"  \\n\\n\"Why not just a straightforward: He was not?\"  \\n\\n\"Well, never having seen the Blessed Leibowitz personally, \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t– \" \\n\\nto see of you and hear of you for a long, long time! Out! \\n\\nBut just one thing– DON\\'T expect to profess your vows \\n\\nwith the others this year. You won\\'t be permitted.\" \\n\\nFor Francis it was like a blow in the stomach with the end \\n\\nof a log. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Six  \\n\\nAs topic for conversation, the pilgrim remained forbidden \\n\\nsubject matter in the abbey; but with respect to the relics \\n\\nand the fallout shelter the prohibition was, of necessity, \\n\\ngradually relaxed– except for their discoverer who \\n\\nremained under orders not to discuss them, and preferably \\n\\nto think of the matter as little as possible. Still, he could \\n\\nnot avoid hearing things now and again, and he knew that \\n\\nin one of the abbey\\'s workshops, monks were at work on \\n\\nthe documents, not only his own but some others that had \\n\\nbeen found in the ancient desk, before the abbot ordered \\n\\nthat the shelter be closed. \\n\\nClosed! The news jolted Brother Francis. The shelter \\n\\nscarcely had been touched. Beyond his own adventure, \\n\\nthere had been no attempt to penetrate further into the \\n\\nsecrets of the shelter except to open the desk which he \\n\\nhad tried to open, with no success, before he noticed the \\n\\nbox. Closed! With no attempt to discover what might lie \\n\\nbeyond the inner door marked \"Hatch Two\" nor to \\n\\ninvestigate \"Sealed Environment\" Without even removing \\n\\nthe stones or the bones. Closed! The investigation abruptly \\n\\nchoked off, without apparent cause. \\n\\nThen there began a rumor. \\n\\n\"Emily had a gold tooth. Emily had a gold tooth. Emily had \\n\\na gold tooth\" It was, in fact, quite true. It was one of those \\n\\nhistorical trivialities that manage somehow to outlive \\n\\nimportant facts which someone should have bothered to \\n\\nremember but which went unrecorded until some monastic \\n\\nhistorian was forced to write: \"Neither the contents of the \\n\\nMemorabilia nor any archaeological source yet uncovered \\n\\ndisclose the name of the ruler who occupied the White \\n\\nPalace during the middle and late sixties, although Fr. \\n\\nBarcus has claimed, not without supporting evidence, that \\n\\nhis name was– \" \\n\\nAnd yet, it was clearly recorded in the Memorabilia that \\n\\nEmily had worn a gold tooth. \\n\\nIt was not surprising that the Lord Abbot commanded that \\n\\nthe crypt be sealed forthwith. Remembering how he had \\n\\nlifted the ancient skull and turned it to face the wall, \\n\\nBrother Francis suddenly feared the wrath of Heaven. \\n\\nEmily Leibowitz had vanished from the face of the Earth at \\n\\nthe beginning of the Flame Deluge, and only after many \\n\\nyears would her widower admit that she was dead. \\n\\nIt was said that God, in order to test mankind which had \\n\\nbecome swelled with pride as in the time of Noah, had \\n\\ncommanded the wise men of that age, among them the \\n\\nBlessed Leibowitz, to devise great engines of war such as \\n\\nhad never before been upon the Earth, weapons of such \\n\\nmight that they contained the very fires of Hell, and that \\n\\nGod had suffered these magi to place the weapons in the \\n\\nhands of princes, and to say to each prince: \"Only because \\n\\nthe enemies have such a thing have we devised this for \\n\\nthee, in order that they may know that thou hast it also, \\n\\nand fear to strike. See to it, m\\'Lord, that thou fearest them \\n\\nas much as they shall now fear thee, that none may \\n\\nunleash this dread thing which we have wrought.\" \\n\\nBut the princes, putting the words of their wise men to \\n\\nnaught, thought each to himself: If I but strike quickly \\n\\nenough, and in secret, I shall destroy those others in their \\n\\nsleep, and there will be none to fight back; the earth shall \\n\\nbe mine. \\n\\nSuch was the folly of princes, and there followed the Flame \\n\\nDeluge. \\n\\nWithin weeks– some said days– it was ended, after the \\n\\nfirst unleashing of the hell-fire. Cities had become puddles \\n\\nof glass, surrounded by vast acreages of broken stone. \\n\\nWhile nations had vanished from the earth, the lands \\n\\nlittered with bodies, both men and cattle, and all manner \\n\\nof beasts, together with the birds of the air and all things \\n\\nthat flew, all things that swam in the rivers, crept in the \\n\\ngrass, or burrowed in holes; having sickened and perished, \\n\\nthey covered the land, and yet where the demons of the \\n\\nFallout covered the countryside, the bodies for a time \\n\\nwould not decay, except in contact with fertile earth. The \\n\\ngreat clouds of wrath engulfed the forests and the fields, \\n\\nwithering trees and causing the crops to die. There were \\n\\ngreat deserts where once life was, and in those places of \\n\\nthe Earth where men still lived, all were sickened by the \\n\\npoisoned air, so that, while some escaped death, none was \\n\\nleft untouched; and many died even in those lands where \\n\\nthe weapons had not struck, because of the poisoned air. \\n\\nIn all parts of the world men fled from one place to other \\n\\nplaces, and there was a confusion of tongues. Much wrath \\n\\nwas kindled against the princes and the servants of the \\n\\nprinces and against the magi who had devised the \\n\\nweapons. Years passed, and yet the Earth was not \\n\\ncleansed. So it was clearly recorded in the Memorabilia. \\n\\nFrom the confusion of tongues, the intermingling of the \\n\\nremnants of many nations, from fear, the hate was born. \\n\\nAnd the hate said: Let us stone and disembowel and burn \\n\\nthe ones who did this thing. Let us make a holocaust of \\n\\nthose who wrought this crime, together with their hirelings \\n\\nand their wise men; burning, let them perish, and all their \\n\\nworks, their names, and even their memories. Let us \\n\\ndestroy them all, and teach our children that the world is \\n\\nnew, that they may know nothing of the deeds that went \\n\\nbefore. Let us make a great simplification, and then the \\n\\nworld shall begin again. \\n\\nSo it was that, after the Deluge, the Fallout, the plagues, \\n\\nthe madness, the confusion of tongues, the rage, there \\n\\nbegan the bloodletting of the Simplification, when \\n\\nremnants of mankind had torn other remnants limb from \\n\\nlimb, killing rulers, scientists, leaders, technicians, \\n\\nteachers, and whatever persons the leaders of the \\n\\nmaddened mobs said deserved death for having helped to \\n\\nmake the Earth what it had become. Nothing had been so \\n\\nhateful in the sight of these mobs as the man of learning, \\n\\nat first because they had served the princes, but then later \\n\\nbecause they refused to join in the bloodletting and tried \\n\\nto oppose the mobs, calling the crowds \"bloodthirsty \\n\\nsimpletons.\" \\n\\nJoyfully the mobs accepted the name, took up the cry: \\n\\nSimpletons! Yes, yes! I\\'m a simpleton! Are you a \\n\\nsimpleton? We\\'ll build a town and we\\'ll name it Simple \\n\\nTown, because by then all the smart bastards that caused \\n\\nall this, they\\'ll be dead! Simpletons! Let\\'s go! This ought to \\n\\nshow \\'em! Anybody here not a simpleton? Get the bastard, \\n\\nif there is! \\n\\nTo escape the fury of the simpleton packs, such learned \\n\\npeople as still survived fled to any sanctuary that offered \\n\\nitself. When Holy Church received them, she vested them \\n\\nin monks\\' robes and tried to hide them in such \\n\\nmonasteries and convents as had survived and could be \\n\\nreoccupied, for the religious were less despised by the mob \\n\\nexcept when they openly defied it and accepted \\n\\nmartyrdom. Sometimes such sanctuary was effective, but \\n\\nmore often it was not. Monasteries were invaded, records \\n\\nand sacred books were burned, refugees were seized and \\n\\nsummarily hanged or burned. The Simplification had \\n\\nceased to have plan or purpose soon after it began, and \\n\\nbecame an insane frenzy of mass murder and destruction \\n\\nsuch as can occur only when the last traces of social order \\n\\nare gone. The madness was transmitted to the children, \\n\\ntaught as they were– not merely to forget– but to hate, \\n\\nand surges of mob fury recurred sporadically even through \\n\\nthe fourth generation after the Deluge. By then, the fury \\n\\nwas directed not against the learned, for there were none, \\n\\nbut against the merely literate. \\n\\nIsaac Edward Leibowitz, after a fruitless search for his \\n\\nwife, had fled to the Cistercians where he remained in \\n\\nhiding during the early post-Deluge years. After six years, \\n\\nhe had gone once more to search for Emily or her grave, in \\n\\nthe far southwest. There he had become convinced at last \\n\\nof her death, for death was unconditionally triumphant in \\n\\nthat place. There in the desert he quietly made a vow. \\n\\nThen he went back to the Cistercians, took their habit, and \\n\\nafter more years became a priest. He gathered a few \\n\\ncompanions about him and made some quiet proposals. \\n\\nAfter a few more years, the proposals filtered to \"Rome,\" \\n\\nwhich was no longer Rome (which was no longer a city), \\n\\nhaving moved elsewhere, moved again, and still again– in \\n\\nless than two decades, after staying in one place for two \\n\\nmillennia. Twelve years after the proposals were made, \\n\\nFather Isaac Edward Leibowitz had won permission from \\n\\nthe Holy See to found a new community of religious, to be \\n\\nnamed after Albertus Magnus, teacher of Saint Thomas, \\n\\nand patron of men of science. Its task, unannounced, and \\n\\nat first only vaguely defined, was to preserve human \\n\\nhistory for the great-great-great-grandchildren of the \\n\\nchildren of the simpletons who wanted it destroyed. Its \\n\\nearliest habit was burlap rags and bindlestiffs– the uniform \\n\\nof the simpleton mob. Its members were either \\n\\n\"bookleggers\" or \"memorizers,\" according to the tasks \\n\\nassigned. The bookleggers smuggled books to the \\n\\nsouthwest desert and buried them there in kegs. The \\n\\nmemorizers committed to rote memory entire volumes of \\n\\nhistory, sacred writings, literature, and science, in case \\n\\nsome unfortunate book smuggler was caught, tortured, \\n\\nand forced to reveal the location of the kegs. Meanwhile, \\n\\nother members of the new Order located a water hole \\n\\nabout three days\\' journey from the book cache and began \\n\\nthe building of a monastery. The project, aimed at saving a \\n\\nsmall remnant of human culture from the remnant of \\n\\nhumanity who wanted it destroyed, was then underway. \\n\\nLeibowitz, while taking his own turn at booklegging, was \\n\\ncaught by a simpleton mob; a turncoat technician, whom \\n\\nthe priest swiftly forgave, identified him as not only a man \\n\\nof learning, but also a specialist in the weapons field. \\n\\nHooded in burlap, he was martyred forthwith, by \\n\\nstrangulation with a hangman\\'s noose not tied for \\n\\nneck-breaking, at the same time being roasted alive– thus \\n\\nsettling a dispute in the crowd concerning the method of \\n\\nexecution. \\n\\nThe memorizers were few, their memories limited.  \\n\\nSome of the book kegs were found and burned, as well as \\n\\nseveral other bookleggers. The monastery itself was \\n\\nattacked thrice before the madness subsided. \\n\\nFrom the vast store of human knowledge, only a few kegs \\n\\nof original books and a pitiful collection of hand-copied \\n\\ntexts, rewritten from memory, had survived in the \\n\\npossession of the Order by the time the madness had \\n\\nended. \\n\\nNow, after six centuries of darkness, the monks still \\n\\npreserved this Memorabilia, studied it, copied and recopied \\n\\nit, and patiently waited. At the beginning, in the time of \\n\\nLeibowitz, it had been hoped– and even anticipated as \\n\\nprobable– that the fourth or fifth generation would begin to \\n\\nwant its heritage back. But the monks of the earliest days \\n\\nhad not counted on the human ability to generate a new \\n\\ncultural inheritance in a couple of generations if an old one \\n\\nis utterly destroyed, to generate it by virtue of lawgivers \\n\\nand prophets, geniuses or maniacs; through a Moses, or \\n\\nthrough a Hitler, or an ignorant but tyrannical grandfather, \\n\\na cultural inheritance may be acquired between dusk and \\n\\ndawn, and many have been so acquired. But the new \\n\\n\"culture\" was an inheritance of darkness, wherein \\n\\nsame thing as \"slave.\" The monks waited. It mattered not \\n\\nat all to them that the knowledge they saved was useless, \\n\\nthat much of it was not really knowledge now, was as \\n\\nto an illiterate wildboy from the hills; this knowledge was \\n\\nempty of content, its subject matter long since gone. Still, \\n\\nsuch knowledge had a symbolic structure that was peculiar \\n\\nto itself, and at least the symbol-interplay could be \\n\\nobserved. To observe the way a knowledge-system is knit \\n\\ntogether is to learn at least a minimum \\n\\nknowledge-of-knowledge, until someday– someday, or \\n\\nsome century– an Integrator would come, and things \\n\\nwould be fitted together again. So time mattered not at all. \\n\\nThe Memorabilia was there, and it was given to them by \\n\\nduty to preserve, and preserve it they would if the \\n\\ndarkness in the world lasted ten more centuries, or even \\n\\nten thousand years, for they, though born in that darkest \\n\\nof ages, were still the very bookleggers and memorizers of \\n\\nthe Beatus Leibowitz; and when they wandered abroad \\n\\nfrom their abbey, each of them, the professed of the \\n\\nOrder– whether stablehand or Lord Abbot– carried as part \\n\\nof his habit a book, usually a Breviary these days, tied up \\n\\nin a bindlestiff. \\n\\nAfter the shelter was closed, the documents and relics \\n\\nwhich had been taken from it were quietly rounded up, one \\n\\nat a time and in an unobtrusive manner, by the abbot. \\n\\nThey became unavailable for inspection, presumably \\n\\nlocked in Arkos\\' study. For all practical purposes, they had \\n\\nvanished. Anything which vanished at the level of the \\n\\nabbot\\'s study was not safe subject matter for public \\n\\ndiscussion. It was something to be whispered about in \\n\\nquiet corridors. Brother Francis seldom heard the whispers. \\n\\nEventually, they stopped, only to be revived when a \\n\\nmessenger from New Rome muttered with the abbot in the \\n\\nrefectory one night. An occasional snatch of their \\n\\nmuttering reached adjacent tables. The whispers lasted for \\n\\na few weeks after the messenger\\'s departure, then \\n\\nsubsided again. \\n\\nBrother Francis Gerard of Utah returned to the desert the \\n\\nreturned, weak and emaciated, and soon was summoned \\n\\ninto the presence of Abbot Arkos, who demanded to know \\n\\nwhether he claimed further conferences with members of \\n\\nthe Heavenly Hosts. \\n\\n\"Oh, no, m\\'Lord Abbot. Nothing by day but buzzards.\" \\n\\n\"By night?\" Arkos asked suspiciously. \\n\\n\"Only wolves,\" said Francis, adding cautiously: \"I think.\" \\n\\nArkos did not choose to belabor the cautious amendment, \\n\\nbut merely frowned. The abbot\\'s frown, Brother Francis \\n\\nenergy which traveled through space with finite velocity \\n\\nand which was as yet not very well understood except in \\n\\nterms of its withering effect upon whatever thing absorbed \\n\\nit, that thing usually being a postulant or novice. Francis \\n\\nhad absorbed a five-second burst of the stuff by the time \\n\\nthe next question was put to him. \\n\\n\"Now what about last year?\" \\n\\nThe novice paused to swallow. \"The– old– man?\" \\n\\n\"The old man.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, Dom Arkos.\" \\n\\nTrying to keep any hint of a question mark out of his tone, \\n\\nArkos droned: \"Just an old man. Nothing more. We\\'re sure \\n\\nof that now.\" \\n\\n\"I think it was just an old man, too.\"  \\n\\nFather Arkos reached wearily for the hickory ruler.  \\n\\nWHACK!  \\n\\n\"Deo gratias!\"  \\n\\nWHACK!  \\n\\n\"Deo. . .\"  \\n\\nAs Francis returned to his cell, the abbot called after him  \\n\\ndown the corridor: \"By the way, I intended to mention. . .\"  \\n\\n\"Yes, Reverend Father?\"  \\n\\n\"No vows this year,\" he said absently, and vanished into  \\n\\nhis study.  \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Seven  \\n\\nBrother Francis spent seven years in the novitiate, seven \\n\\nLenten vigils in the desert, and became highly proficient in \\n\\nthe imitation of wolf calls. For the amusement of his \\n\\nbrethren, he summoned the pack to the vicinity of the \\n\\nabbey by howling from the walls after dark. By day, he \\n\\nserved in the kitchen, scrubbed the stone floors, and \\n\\ncontinued his classroom study of antiquity. \\n\\nThen one day a messenger from a seminary in New Rome \\n\\ncame riding to the abbey on an ass. After a long \\n\\nconference with the abbot, the messenger sought out \\n\\nBrother Francis. He seemed surprised to find that youth, \\n\\nnow fully a man, still wearing the habit of a novice and \\n\\nscrubbing the kitchen floor. \\n\\n\"We have been studying the documents you discovered, \\n\\nfor some years now,\" he told the novice. \"Quite a few of us \\n\\nare convinced they\\'re authentic.\" \\n\\nFrancis lowered his head. \"I\\'m not permitted to mention \\n\\nthe matter, Father,\" he said. \\n\\n\"Oh, that.\" The messenger smiled and handed him a scrap \\n\\nof paper bearing the abbot\\'s seal, and written in the ruler\\'s \\n\\nhand: Ecce Inquisitor Curiae. Ausculta et obsequere. \\n\\nArkos, AOL, Abbas. \\n\\n\"It\\'s all right,\" he added hastily, noticing the novice\\'s \\n\\nsudden tension. \"I\\'m not speaking to you officially. \\n\\nSomeone else from the court will take your statements \\n\\nlater. You know, don\\'t you, that your papers have been in \\n\\nNew Rome for some time now? I just brought some of \\n\\nthem back.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis shook his head. He knew less, perhaps, \\n\\nthan anyone, concerning high-level reactions to his \\n\\ndiscovery of the relics. He noticed that the messenger \\n\\nwore the white habit of the Dominicans, and he wondered \\n\\nwith a certain uneasiness about the nature of the \"court\" \\n\\nwhereof the Black Friar had spoken. There was an \\n\\ninquisition against Catharism in the Pacific Coast region, \\n\\nbut he could not imagine how that court could be \\n\\nconcerned with relics of the Beatus. Ecce Inquisitor Curiae, \\n\\nthe note said. Probably the abbot meant \"investigator.\" \\n\\nThe Dominican seemed a rather mild-humored man, and \\n\\nwas not carrying any visible engines of torture. \\n\\n\"We expect the case for canonization of your founder to be  \\n\\nreopened soon,\" the messenger explained. \"Your Abbot \\n\\nArkos is a very wise and prudent man.\" He chuckled. \"By \\n\\nand by having the shelter sealed before it was fully \\n\\nexplored– Well, you do understand, don\\'t you?\" \\n\\n\"No, Father. I had supposed he thought the whole thing \\n\\ntoo trivial to spend any time on.\" \\n\\nThe Black Friar laughed. \"Trivial? I think not. But if your \\n\\nOrder turns up evidence, relics, miracles, and whatever, \\n\\nthe court has to consider the source. Every religious \\n\\ncommunity is eager to see its founder canonized. So your \\n\\nabbot very wisely told you: \\'Hands off the shelter.\\' I\\'m \\n\\nsure it\\'s been frustrating for all of you, but– better for the \\n\\ncause of your founder to let the shelter be explored with \\n\\nother withesses present.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re going to open it again?\" Francis asked eagerly. \\n\\n\"No, not I. But when the court is ready, it will send \\n\\nobservers. Then anything that is found in the shelter that \\n\\nmight affect the case will be safe, in case the opposition \\n\\nquestions its authenticity. Of course, the only reason for \\n\\nsuspecting that the contents of the shelter might affect the \\n\\ncause is– Well, the things you found.\"  \\n\\n\"May I ask how that is, Father?\" \\n\\n\"Well, one of the embarrassments at the time of the \\n\\nbeatification was the early life of Blessed Leibowitz– before \\n\\nhe became a monk and a priest. The advocate for the \\n\\nother side kept trying to cast doubt on the early period, \\n\\npre-Deluge. He was trying to establish that Leibowitz never \\n\\nmade a careful search– that his wife might even have been \\n\\nalive at the time of his ordination. Well, it wouldn\\'t be the \\n\\nfirst time, of course; sometimes dispensations have been \\n\\ngranted– but that\\'s beside the point. The advocatus diaboli \\n\\nwas just trying to cast doubt on your founder\\'s character. \\n\\nTrying to suggest that he had accepted Holy Orders and \\n\\ntaken vows before being certain his family responsibility \\n\\nwas ended. The opposition failed, but it may try again. And \\n\\nif those human remains you found really are– \" He \\n\\nshrugged and smiled. \\n\\nFrancis nodded. \"It would pinpoint the date of her death.\" \\n\\n\"At the very beginning of the war that nearly ended \\n\\neverything. And in my own opinion– well, that handwriting \\n\\nin the box, it\\'s either that of the Beatus or a very clever \\n\\ncounterfeit.\"  \\n\\nFrancis reddened.  \\n\\n\"I\\'m not suggesting that you were involved in any  \\n\\nnoticing the blush.  \\n\\nThe novice, however, had only been remembering his own  \\n\\nopinion of the scrawl.  \\n\\n\"Tell me, how did it happen?– how you located the site, I  \\n\\nmean. I\\'ll need the whole story of it.\"  \\n\\n\"Well, it started because of the wolves.\"  \\n\\nThe Dominican began taking notes.  \\n\\nA few days after the messenger\\'s departure from the  \\n\\nabbey, Abbot Arkos called for Brother Francis. \"Do you still  \\n\\nfeel that your vocation is with us?\" Arkos asked pleasantly.  \\n\\n\"If m\\'Lord Abbot will pardon my execrable vanity– \"  \\n\\n\"Oh, let\\'s ignore your execrable vanity for a moment. Do  \\n\\nyou or don\\'t you?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, Magister meus.\" \\n\\nThe abbot beamed. \"Well, now, my son. I think we\\'re \\n\\nconvinced of it too. If you\\'re ready to commit yourself for \\n\\nall time, I think the time\\'s ripe for you to profess your \\n\\nsolemn vows.\" He paused for a moment, and, watching the \\n\\nnovice\\'s face, seemed disappointed not to detect any \\n\\nchange of expression. \"What\\'s this? You\\'re not glad to hear \\n\\nit? You\\'re not– ? Ho! what\\'s wrong?\" \\n\\nWhile Francis\\' face had remained a politely attentive mask, \\n\\nthe mask gradually lost color. His knees buckled suddenly. \\n\\nFrancis had fainted. \\n\\nTwo weeks later, the novice Francis, having perhaps set an \\n\\nendurance record for survival time on desert vigils, left the \\n\\nranks of the novitiate and, vowing perpetual poverty, \\n\\nchastity, obedience, together with the special pledges \\n\\npeculiar to the community, received blessings and a \\n\\nbindlestiff in the abbey, and became forever a professed \\n\\nmonk of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz, chained by \\n\\nchains of his own forging to the foot of the Cross and the \\n\\nrule of the Order. Thrice the ritual inquired of him: \"If God \\n\\ncalleth thee to be His Booklegger, wilt thou suffer death \\n\\nbefore betraying thy brethren?\" And thrice Francis \\n\\nresponded: \"Aye, Lord.\" \\n\\n\"Then arise Brother Bookleggers and Brother Memorizers \\n\\nand receive the kiss of brotherhood. Ecce quam bonum, et \\n\\nquam jucundum. . .\" \\n\\nBrother Francis was transferred from the kitchen and \\n\\nassigned to less menial labor. He became apprentice \\n\\ncopyist to an aged monk named Homer, and, if things \\n\\nlifetime in the copyroom, where he would dedicate the rest \\n\\nof his days to such tasks as the hand-copying of algebra \\n\\ntexts and illuminating their pages with olive leaves and \\n\\ncheerful cherubim surrounding tables of logarithms. \\n\\nBrother Homer was a gentle old man, and Brother Francis \\n\\nliked him from the start. \"Most of us do better work on the \\n\\nassigned copy,\" Homer told him, \"if we have our own \\n\\nproject too. Most of the copyists become interested in \\n\\nsome particular work from the Memorabilia and like to \\n\\nspend a little time at it on the side. For example, Brother \\n\\nSarl over there– his work was lagging, and he was making \\n\\nmistakes. So we let him spend an hour a day on a project \\n\\nhe chose for himself. When the work gets so tedious that \\n\\nhe starts making errors in copy, he can put it aside for a \\n\\nthe same. If you finish your assigned work before the day\\'s \\n\\nover but don\\'t have your own project, you\\'ll have to spend \\n\\nthe extra time on our perennials.\" \\n\\n\"Perennials?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, and I don\\'t mean plants. There\\'s a perennial demand \\n\\nfrom the whole clergy for various books– Missals, \\n\\nScripture, Breviaries, the Summa, encyclopaediae, and the \\n\\nlike. We sell quite a lot of them. So when you don\\'t have a \\n\\npet project, we\\'ll put you on the perennials when you finish \\n\\nearly. You\\'ve plenty of time to decide.\" \\n\\n\"What project did Brother Sarl pick?\" \\n\\nThe aged overseer paused. \"Well, I doubt if you\\'d even \\n\\nunderstand it. I don\\'t. He seems to have found a method \\n\\nfor restoring missing words and phrases to some of the old \\n\\nfragments of original text in the Memorabilia. Perhaps the \\n\\nleft-hand side of a half-burned book is legible, but the right \\n\\nedge of each page is burned, with a few words missing at \\n\\nthe end of each line. He\\'s worked out a mathematical \\n\\nmethod for finding the missing words. It\\'s not foolproof, \\n\\nbut it works to some degree. He\\'s managed to restore four \\n\\nwhole pages since he began the attempt.\" \\n\\nFrancis glanced at Brother Sarl, who was an octogenarian \\n\\nand nearly blind. \"How long did it take him?\" the \\n\\napprentice asked. \\n\\n\"About forty years,\" said Brother Homer. \"Of course he\\'s \\n\\nonly spent about five hours a week at it, and it does take \\n\\nconsiderable arithmetic.\" \\n\\nFrancis nodded thoughtfully. \"If one page per decade could \\n\\nbe restored, maybe in a few centuries– \" \\n\\n\"Even less,\" croaked Brother Sarl without looking up from \\n\\nhis work. \"The more you fill in, the faster the remainder \\n\\ngoes. I\\'ll get the next page done in a couple of years. After \\n\\nthat, God willing, maybe– \" His voice tapered off into a \\n\\nmumble. Francis frequently noticed that Brother Sarl \\n\\ntalked to himself while working. \\n\\n\"Suit yourself,\" said Brother Homer. \"We can always use \\n\\nmore help on the perennials, but you can have your own \\n\\nproject when you want one.\" \\n\\nThe idea came to Brother Francis in an unexpected flash. \\n\\n\"May I use the time,\" he blurted, \"to make a copy of the \\n\\nLeibowitz blueprint I found?\" \\n\\nBrother Homer seemed momentarily startled. \"Well– I \\n\\ndon\\'t know, son. Our Lord Abbot is, well– just a little \\n\\nsensitive on that subject. And the thing may not belong in \\n\\nthe Memorabilia. It\\'s in the tentative file now.\" \\n\\n\"But you know they fade, Brother. And it\\'s been handled a \\n\\nlot in the light. The Dominicans had it in New Rome for so \\n\\nlong– \" \\n\\n\"Well– I suppose it would be a rather brief project. If \\n\\ndoubt. \\n\\n\"Perhaps I could include it as one of a set,\" Francis hastily \\n\\nthey\\'re brittle. If I made several duplicates– of some of the \\n\\nothers– \" \\n\\nHomer smiled wryly. \"What you\\'re suggesting is, that by \\n\\nincluding the Leibowitz blueprint in a set, you might escape \\n\\ndetection.\" \\n\\nFrancis reddened. \\n\\n\"Father Arkos might not even notice, eh?– If he happened \\n\\nto wander through.\" \\n\\nFrancis squirmed. \\n\\n\"All right,\" said Homer, his eyes twinkling slightly. \"You \\n\\nmay use your unassigned time to make duplicates of any \\n\\nof the recopied prints that are in bad condition. If anything \\n\\nelse gets mixed up in the lot, I\\'ll try not to notice.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis spent several months of his unassigned \\n\\ntime in redrawing some of the older prints from the \\n\\nMemorabilia\\'s files before daring to touch the Leibowitz \\n\\nprint. If the old drawings were worth saving at all, they \\n\\nneeded to be recopied every century or two anyhow. Not \\n\\nonly did the original copies fade, but often the redrawn \\n\\nversions became nearly illegible after a time, due to the \\n\\nimpermanence of the inks employed. He had not the \\n\\nslightest notion why the ancients had used white lines and \\n\\nlettering on a dark background, in preference to the \\n\\nreverse. When he roughly resketched a design in charcoal, \\n\\nthereby reversing the background, the rough sketch \\n\\nancients were immeasurably wiser than Francis; if they \\n\\nhad taken the trouble to put ink where blank paper would \\n\\nordinarily be, and leave slivers of white paper where an \\n\\ninked line would appear in a straightforward drawing, then \\n\\nthey must have had their reasons. Francis recopied the \\n\\ndocuments to appear as nearly like the originals as \\n\\npossible– even though the task of spreading blue ink \\n\\naround tiny white letters was particularly tedious, and \\n\\nquite wasteful of ink, a fact which caused Brother Homer to \\n\\ngrumble. \\n\\nHe copied an old architectural print, then a drawing for a \\n\\nmachine part whose geometry was apparent but whose \\n\\npurpose was vague. He redrew a mandala abstraction, \\n\\ntitled \"STATOR WNDG MOD 73-A 3-PH 6-P l800-RPM 5-HP \\n\\nCL-A SQUIRREL CAGE,\" which proved completely \\n\\nincomprehensible, and not at all capable of imprisoning a \\n\\nsquirrel. The ancients were often subtle; perhaps one \\n\\nneeded a special set of mirrors in order to see the squirrel. \\n\\nHe painstakingly redrew it anyhow. \\n\\nOnly after the abbot, who occasionally passed through the \\n\\ncopyroom, had seen him working at another blueprint at \\n\\nleast three times (twice Arkos had paused for a quick look \\n\\nat Francis\\' work), did he summon the courage to venture \\n\\nto the Memorabilia files for the Leibowitz blueprint, nearly \\n\\na year after beginning his freetime project. \\n\\nThe original document had already been subjected to a \\n\\ncertain amount of restorative work. Except for the fact that \\n\\nit bore the name of the Beatus, it was disappointingly like \\n\\nmost of the others he had redrawn. \\n\\nThe Leibowitz print, another abstraction, appealed to \\n\\nnothing, least of all to reason. He studied it until he could \\n\\nsee the whole amazing complexity with his eyes closed, \\n\\nbut knew no more than he had known before. It appeared \\n\\nto be no more than a network of lines connecting a \\n\\npatchwork of doohickii, squiggles, quids, laminulae, and \\n\\nthingumbob. The lines were mostly horizontal or vertical, \\n\\nand crossed each other with either a little jump-mark or a \\n\\ndot; they made right-angle turns to get around doohickii, \\n\\nand they never stopped in mid-space but always \\n\\nterminated at a squiggle, quiggle, quid, or thingumbob. It \\n\\nmade so little sense that a long period of staring at it \\n\\nproduced a stupefying effect. Nevertheless he began work \\n\\nat duplicating every detail, even to the copying of a central \\n\\nbrownish stain which he thought might be the blood of the \\n\\nBlessed Martyr, but which Brother Jeris suggested was \\n\\nonly the stain left by a decayed apple core. \\n\\nBrother Jeris, who had joined the apprentice copyroom at \\n\\nthe same time as Brother Francis, seemed to enjoy teasing \\n\\nhim about the project. \"What, pray,\" he asked, squinting \\n\\nover Francis\\' shoulder, \"is the meaning of \\'Transistorized \\n\\nControl System for Unit Six-B,\\' learned Brother?\" \\n\\n\"Clearly, it is the title of the document,\" said Francis, \\n\\nfeeling slightly cross. \\n\\n\"Clearly. But what does it mean?\" \\n\\n\"It is the name of the diagram which lies before your eyes, \\n\\nBrother Simpleton. What does \\'Jeris\\' mean?\" \\n\\n\"Very little, I\\'m sure,\" said Brother Jeris with mock \\n\\nhumility. \"Forgive my density, please. You have \\n\\nsuccessfully defined the name by pointing to the creature \\n\\nnamed, which is truly the meaning of the name. But now \\n\\nthe creature-diagram itself represents something, does it \\n\\nnot? What does the diagram represent?\" \\n\\n\"The transistorized control system for unit six-B, \\n\\nobviously.\" \\n\\nJeris laughed. \"Quite clear! Eloquent! If the creature is the \\n\\nname, then the name is the creature. \\'Equals may be \\n\\nsubstituted for equals,\\' or \\'The order of an equality is \\n\\nreversible,\\' but may we proceed to the next axiom? If \\n\\n\\'Quantities equal to the same quantity may substitute for \\n\\neach other\\' is true, then is there not some \\'same quantity\\' \\n\\nwhich both name and diagram represent? Or is it a closed \\n\\nsystem?\" \\n\\nFrancis reddened. \"I would imagine,\" he said slowly, after \\n\\npausing to stifle his annoyance, \"that the diagram \\n\\nrepresents an abstract concept, rather than a concrete \\n\\nthing. Perhaps the ancients had a systematic method for \\n\\ndepicting a pure thought. It\\'s clearly not a recognizable \\n\\npicture of an object.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, yes, it\\'s clearly unrecognizable!\" Brother Jeris agreed \\n\\nwith a chuckle. \\n\\n\"On the other hand, perhaps it does depict an object, but \\n\\nonly in a very formal stylistic way– so that one would need \\n\\nspecial training or– \" \\n\\n\"Special eyesight?\" \\n\\n\"In my opinion, it\\'s a high abstraction of perhaps \\n\\ntranscendental value expressing a thought of the Beatus \\n\\nLeibowitz.\" \\n\\n\"Bravo! Now what was he thinking about?\" \\n\\n\"Why– \\'Circuit Design,\\'\" said Francis, picking the term out \\n\\nof the block of lettering at the lower right. \\n\\n\"Hmmm, what discipline does that art pertain to, Brother? \\n\\nWhat is its genus, species, property, and difference? Or is \\n\\nit only. an \\'accident\\'?\" \\n\\nJeris was becoming pretentious in his sarcasm, Francis \\n\\nobserve this column of figures, and its heading: \\n\\n\\'Electronics Parts Numbers.\\' There was once, an art or \\n\\nscience, called Electronics, which might belong to both Art \\n\\nand Science.\" \\n\\n\"Uh-huh! Thus settling \\'genus\\' and \\'species.\\' Now as to \\n\\n\\'difference,\\' if I may pursue the line. What was the subject \\n\\nmatter of Electronics?\" \\n\\n\"That too is written,\" said Francis, who had searched the \\n\\nMemorabilia from high to low in an attempt to find clues \\n\\nwhich might make the blueprint slightly more \\n\\ncomprehensible– but to very small avail. \"The subject \\n\\nmatter of Electronics was the electron,\" he explained. \\n\\n\"So it is written, indeed. I am impressed. I know so little of \\n\\nthese things. What, pray, was the \\'electron\\'?\" \\n\\n\"Well, there is one fragmentary source which alludes to it \\n\\nas a \\'Negative Twist of Nothingness.\\'\" \\n\\n\"What! How did they negate a nothingness? Wouldn\\'t that \\n\\nmake it a somethingness?\" \\n\\n\"Perhaps the negation applies to \\'twist.\\'\" \\n\\n\"Ah! Then we would have an \\'Untwisted Nothing,\\' eh? Have \\n\\nyou discovered how to untwist a nothingness?\" \\n\\n\"Not yet,\" Francis admitted. \\n\\nit, and you may learn how. Then we\\'d have the \\'electron\\' \\n\\nin our midst, wouldn\\'t we? Whatever would we do with it? \\n\\nPut it on the altar in the chapel?\" \\n\\n\"All right,\" Francis sighed, \"I don\\'t know. But I have a \\n\\ncertain faith that the \\'electron\\' existed at one time, \\n\\nalthough I don\\'t know how it was constructed or what it \\n\\nmight have been used for.\" \\n\\n\"How touching!\" chuckled the iconoclast, and returned to \\n\\nhis work. \\n\\nThe sporadic teasing of Brother Jeris saddened Francis, but \\n\\ndid nothing to lessen his devotion to his project. \\n\\nThe exact duplication of every mark, blotch, and stain \\n\\nproved impossible, but the accuracy of his facsimile proved \\n\\nsufficient for the deception of the eye at a distance of two \\n\\npaces, and therefore adequate for display purposes, so \\n\\nthat the original might be sealed and packed away. Having \\n\\ncompleted the facsimile, Brother Francis found himself \\n\\ndisappointed. The drawing was too stark. There was \\n\\nnothing about it to suggest at first glance that it might be \\n\\na holy relic. The style was terse and unpretentious– \\n\\nfittingly enough, perhaps, for the Beatus himself, and yet– \\n\\nA copy of the relic was not enough. Saints were humble \\n\\npeople who glorified not themselves but God, and it was \\n\\nleft to others to portray the inward glory of the saintly by \\n\\noutward, visible signs. The stark copy was not enough: it \\n\\nwas coldly unimaginative and did not commemorate the \\n\\nsaintly qualities of the Beatus in any visible way. \\n\\nGlorificemus, thought Francis, while he worked on the \\n\\nperennials. He was copying pages of the Psalms at the \\n\\nmoment for later rebinding. He paused to regain his place \\n\\nin the text, and to notice meaning in the words– for after \\n\\nhours of copying, he had ceased to read at all, and merely \\n\\nallowed his hand to retrace the letters which his eyes \\n\\nencountered. He noticed that he had been copying David\\'s \\n\\nprayer for pardon, the fourth penitential psalm, \"Miserere \\n\\nniei, Deus . . . for I know my iniquity, and my sin is always \\n\\nbefore me.\" It was a humble prayer, but the page before \\n\\nhis eyes was not written in a humble style to match. The M \\n\\nin Miserere was gold-leaf inlay. A flourishing arabesque of \\n\\ninterwoven gold and violet filaments filled the margins and \\n\\ngrew into nests around the splendid capitals at the \\n\\nbeginning of each verse. However humble the prayer itself, \\n\\nthe page was magnificent. Brother Francis was copying \\n\\nonly the body of the text onto new parchment, leaving \\n\\nspaces for the splendid capitals and margins as wide as the \\n\\ntext lines. Other craftsmen would fill in riots of color \\n\\naround his simply inked copy and would construct the \\n\\npictorial capitals. He was learning to illuminate, but was \\n\\nnot yet proficient enough to be trusted at gold-inlay work \\n\\non the perennials. \\n\\nGlorificemus. He was thinking of the blueprint again. \\n\\nbegan to plan. He found the finest available lambskin and \\n\\nspent several weeks of his spare time at curing it and \\n\\nstretching it and stoning it to a perfect surface, which he \\n\\neventually bleached to a snowy whiteness and carefully \\n\\nstored away. For months afterward, he spent every \\n\\navailable minute of his free time looking through the \\n\\nMemorabilia, again seeking clues to the meaning of the \\n\\nLeibowitz print. He found nothing resembling the squiggles \\n\\nmeaning, but after a long time he stumbled across a \\n\\nfragment of a book which contained a partially destroyed \\n\\npage whose subject matter was blueprinting. It seemed to \\n\\nbe a piece of an encyclopaedia. The reference was brief \\n\\nand some of the article was missing, but after reading it \\n\\nseveral times, he began to suspect that he– and many \\n\\nearlier copyists– had wasted a lot of time and ink. The \\n\\nwhite on dark effect seemed not to have been a \\n\\nparticularly desirable feature, but one which resulted from \\n\\nthe peculiarities of a certain cheap reproduction process. \\n\\nThe original drawing from which the blueprint had been \\n\\nmade had been black-on-white. He had to resist a sudden \\n\\nimpulse to beat his head against the stone floor. All that \\n\\nHomer need not be told. It would be a work of charity to \\n\\nsay nothing about it, because of Brother Homer\\'s heart \\n\\ncondition. \\n\\nThe knowledge that the color scheme of blueprints was an \\n\\naccidental feature of those ancient drawings lent impetus \\n\\nto his plan. A glorified copy of the Leibowitz print could be \\n\\nmade without incorporating the accidental feature. With \\n\\nthe color scheme reversed, no one would recognize the \\n\\ndrawing at first. Certain other features could obviously be \\n\\nmodified. He dared change nothing that he did not \\n\\nunderstand, but surely the parts tables and the \\n\\nblock-lettered information could be spread symmetrically \\n\\naround the diagram on scrolls and shields. Because the \\n\\nmeaning of the diagram itself was obscure, he dared not \\n\\nalter its shape or plan by a hair; but since its color scheme \\n\\nwas unimportant, it might as well be beautiful. He \\n\\nconsidered gold inlay for the squiggles and doohickii, but \\n\\nthe thingumbob was too intricate for goldwork, and a gold \\n\\nquid would seem ostentatious. The quiggles just had to be \\n\\ndone jet black, but that meant that the lines should be \\n\\noff-black, to assert the quiggles. While the unsymmetrical \\n\\ndesign would have to stay as it was, he could think of no \\n\\nreason why its meaning would be altered by using it as a \\n\\ntrellis for a climbing vine, whose branches (carefully \\n\\ndodging the quiggles) might be made to furnish an \\n\\nimpression of symmetry or render asymmetry natural. \\n\\nWhen Brother Homer illuminated a capital M, transmuting \\n\\nit into a wonderful jungle of leaves, berries, branches, and \\n\\nperhaps a wily serpent, it nevertheless remained legible as \\n\\nM. Brothex Francis saw no reason for supposing that the \\n\\nsame would not apply to the diagram. \\n\\nThe general shape, over-all, with a scrolled border, might \\n\\nwell become a shield, rather than the stark rectangle which \\n\\nenclosed the drawing in the print. He made dozens of \\n\\npreliminary sketches. At the very top of the parchment \\n\\nwould be a representation of the Triune God, and at the \\n\\nvery bottom– the coat of arms of the Albertian Order, with, \\n\\njust above it the image of the Beatus. \\n\\nBut there was no accurate likeness of the Beatus in \\n\\nexistence, so far as Francis knew. There were several \\n\\nfanciful portraits, but none dating back to the \\n\\nSimplification. There was, as yet, not even a conventional \\n\\nrepresentation, although tradition told that Leibowitz had \\n\\nbeen rather tall and somewhat stooped. But perhaps when \\n\\nthe shelter was reopened– \\n\\nBrother Francis\\' preliminary sketchwork was interrupted \\n\\none afternoon by his sudden awareness that the presence \\n\\nwhich loomed behind him and cast its shadow across his \\n\\ncopy-table was that of– was that of– No! Please! Beate \\n\\nLeibowitz, audi me! Mercy, Lord! Let it be anybody but– \\n\\n\"Well, what have we here?\" rumbled the abbot, glancing \\n\\nover his designs. \\n\\n\"A drawing, m\\'Lord Abbot.\" \\n\\n\"So I notice. But what is it?\" \\n\\n\"The Leibowitz blueprint.\" \\n\\n\"That one you found? What? It doesn\\'t look much like it. \\n\\nWhy the changes?\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s going to be– \"  \\n\\n\"Speak louder!\"  \\n\\n\"– AN ILLUMINATED COPY!\" Brother Francis involuntarily  \\n\\nshrieked.  \\n\\n\"Oh.\"  \\n\\nAbbot Arkos shrugged and wandered away.  \\n\\nBrother Homer, a few seconds later, while wandering past  \\n\\nthe apprentice\\'s desk was surprised to notice that Francis \\n\\nhad fainted. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Eight  \\n\\nTo the amazement of Brother Francis, Abbot Arkos no \\n\\nlonger objected to the monk\\'s interest in the relics. Since \\n\\nthe Dominicans had agreed to examine the matter, the \\n\\nabbot had relaxed; and since the cause for the \\n\\ncanonization had resumed some progress in New Rome, he \\n\\nappeared at times to forget entirely that anything special \\n\\nhad happened during the vocational vigil of one Francis \\n\\nGerard, AOL, formerly of Utah, presently of the scriptorium \\n\\nand copyroom. The incident was eleven years old. The \\n\\npreposterous whisperings in the novitiate concerning the \\n\\npilgrim\\'s identity had long since died away. The novitiate of \\n\\nBrother Francis\\' time was not the novitiate of today. The \\n\\nnewest of the new crop of youngsters had never heard of \\n\\nthe affair. \\n\\nThe affair had cost Brother Francis seven Lenten vigils \\n\\namong the wolves, however, and he never fully trusted the \\n\\nsubject as safe. Whenever he mentioned it, he would \\n\\ndream that night of wolves and of Arkos; in the dream, \\n\\nArkos kept flinging meat to the wolves, and the meat was \\n\\nFrancis. \\n\\nThe monk found, however, that he might continue his \\n\\nproject without being molested, except by Brother Jeris \\n\\nwho continued to tease. Francis began the actual \\n\\nillumination of the lambskin. The intricacies of scrollwork \\n\\nand the excruciating delicacy of the gold inlay work would, \\n\\nbecause of the brevity of his spare-project time, make it a \\n\\nlabor of many years; but in a dark sea of centuries wherein \\n\\nnothing seemed to flow, a lifetime was only brief eddy, \\n\\neven for the man who lived it. There was a tedium of \\n\\nrepeated days and repeated seasons; then there were \\n\\naches and pains, finally Extreme Unction, and a moment of \\n\\nblackness at the end– or at the beginning, rather. For then \\n\\nthe small shivering soul who had endured the tedium, \\n\\nendured it badly or well, would find itself in a place of light, \\n\\nfind itself absorbed in the burning gaze of infinitely \\n\\ncompassionate eyes as it stood before the Just One. And \\n\\nthen the King would say: \"Come,\" or the King would say: \\n\\n\"Go,\" and only for that moment had the tedium of years \\n\\nan age as Francis knew. \\n\\nBrother Sarl finished the fifth page of his mathematical \\n\\nrestoration, collapsed over his desk, and died a few hours \\n\\nlater. Never mind. His notes were intact. Someone, after a \\n\\ncentury or two, would come along and find them \\n\\ninteresting, would perhaps complete his work. Meanwhile, \\n\\nprayers ascended for the soul of Sarl. \\n\\nThen there was Brother Fingo and his woodcarving. He had \\n\\nbeen returned to the carpentry shop a year or two ago and \\n\\nwas permitted occasionally to chisel and scrape at his \\n\\nhalf-finished image of the Martyr. Like Francis, Fingo had \\n\\nonly an hour now and then to work at his chosen task; the \\n\\nwoodcarving progressed at a rate that was almost \\n\\nimperceptible unless one looked at the carving only after \\n\\nintervals of several months. Francis saw it too frequently \\n\\nto notice the growth. He found himself charmed by Fingo\\'s \\n\\neasygoing exuberance, even while realizing that Fingo had \\n\\nadopted his affable manner to compensate for his ugliness, \\n\\nand he liked to spend idle minutes, whenever he could find \\n\\nthem, watching Fingo work. \\n\\nThe carpentry shop was rich with the odors of pine, cedar, \\n\\nspruce shavings, and human sweat. Wood was not easy to \\n\\nobtain at the abbey. Except for fig trees and a couple of \\n\\ncottonwoods in the immediate vicinity of the water hole, \\n\\nthe region was treeless. It was a three-day ride to the \\n\\nnearest stand of scrub that passed for timber, and the \\n\\nwoodgatherers often were gone from the abbey for a week \\n\\nat a time before they came back with a few donkey-loads \\n\\nof branches for making pegs, spokes, and an occasional \\n\\nchair leg. Sometimes they dragged back a log or two for \\n\\nreplacing a rotting beam. But with such a limited wood \\n\\nsupply, carpenters were necessarily woodcarvers and \\n\\nsculptors as well. \\n\\non a bench in the corner of the workshop and sketch, \\n\\ntrying to visualize details of the carving which were, as \\n\\nyet, only roughly hewed in the wood. The vague outlines of \\n\\nthe face were there, but still masked by splinters and \\n\\nchisel-marks. With his sketches, Brother Francis tried to \\n\\nanticipate the features before they emerged from the \\n\\ngrain. Fingo glanced at his sketches and laughed. But as \\n\\nthe work progressed, Francis could not escape the feeling \\n\\nthat the face of the carving was smiling a vaguely familiar \\n\\nsmile. He sketched it thus, and the feeling of familiarity \\n\\nincreased. Still, he could not place the face, or recall who \\n\\nhad smiled so wryly. \\n\\n\"Not bad, really. Not bad at all,\" said Fingo of his sketches. \\n\\nThe copyist shrugged. \"I can\\'t get over the feeling that I\\'ve \\n\\nseen him before.\" \\n\\n\"Not around here, Brother. Not in my time.\" \\n\\npassed before he visited the workshop again. \\n\\n\"The face is nearly finished, Francisco,\" said the \\n\\nwoodcarver. \"How do you like it now?\" \\n\\n\"I know him!\" Francis gasped, staring at the merry-but-sad \\n\\nwrinkled eyes, the hint of a wry smile at the corners of the \\n\\nmouth– somehow almost too familiar. \\n\\n\"You do? Who is it then?\" wondered Fingo. \\n\\n\"It\\'s– well, I\\'m not sure. I think I know him. But– \" \\n\\nFingo laughed. \"You\\'re just recognizing your own \\n\\nsketches,\" he offered in explanation. \\n\\nFrancis was not so certain, Still, he could not quite place \\n\\nthe face. \\n\\nHmm-hnnn! the wry smile seemed to say. \\n\\nThe abbot found the smile irritating, however. While he \\n\\nallowed the work to be completed, he declared that he \\n\\nwould never permit it to be used for the purpose originally \\n\\nplanned– as an image to be placed in the church if the \\n\\ncanonization of the Beatus were ever accomplished. Many \\n\\nyears later, when the whole figure was completed, Arkos \\n\\ncaused it to be set up in the corridor of the guesthouse, \\n\\nbut later transferred it to his study after it had shocked a \\n\\nvisitor from New Rome. \\n\\nSlowly, painfully, Brother Francis was making the lambskin \\n\\na blaze of beauty. Word of his project spread beyond the \\n\\ncopyroom, and the monks often gathered around his table \\n\\nto watch the work and murmur admiration. \"Inspiration,\" \\n\\nsomeone whispered. \"There\\'s evidence enough. It could \\n\\nhave been the Beatus he met out there– \" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t see why you don\\'t spend your time on something \\n\\nuseful,\" grumbled Brother Jeris, whose sarcastic wit had \\n\\nbeen exhausted by several years of patient answers from \\n\\nBrother Francis. The skeptic had been using his own \\n\\nfree-project time for making and decorating oilskin shades \\n\\nfor the lamps in the church, thereby winning the attention \\n\\nof the abbot, who soon placed him in charge of the \\n\\nperennials. As the account ledgers soon began to testify, \\n\\nBrother Jeris\\' promotion was justified. \\n\\nBrother Homer, the old master-copyist, fell ill. Within \\n\\nweeks, it became apparent that the well-loved monk was \\n\\nAdvent. The remains of the saintly old master-copyist were \\n\\ncommitted to the earth of their origin. While the \\n\\ncommunity expressed its grief in prayer, Arkos quietly \\n\\nappointed Brother Jeris as master of the copyroom. \\n\\nOn the day after his appointment, Brother Jeris informed \\n\\nBrother Francis that he considered it appropriate for him to \\n\\nput away the things of a child and start doing a man\\'s \\n\\nwork. Obediently, the monk wrapped his precious project \\n\\nin parchment, protected it with heavy boards, shelved it, \\n\\nand began making oilskin lampshades in his spare time. He \\n\\nmurmured no protest, but contented himself with realizing \\n\\nthat someday the soul of dear Brother Jeris would depart \\n\\nby the same road as the soul of Brother Homer, to begin \\n\\nthat life for which this world was but a staging ground– \\n\\nmight begin it at a rather early age, judging by the extent. \\n\\nto which he fretted, fumed, and drove himself; and \\n\\nafterward, God willing, Francis might be allowed to \\n\\ncomplete his beloved document. \\n\\nProvidence, however, took an earlier hand in the matter, \\n\\nwithout summoning the soul of Brother Jeris to its Maker. \\n\\nDuring the summer which followed his appointment as \\n\\nmaster, a prothonotary apostolic and his retinue of clerks \\n\\ncame by way of a donkey train to the abbey from New \\n\\nRome; he introduced himself as Monsignor Malfreddo \\n\\nAguerra, the postulator for the Beatus Leibowitz in the \\n\\ncanonization procedure. With him were several \\n\\nDominicans. He had come to observe the reopening of the \\n\\nshelter and the exploration of \"Sealed Environment.\" Also, \\n\\nto investigate such evidence as the abbey could produce \\n\\nabbot\\'s dismay– reports of an alleged apparition of the \\n\\nBeatus which had, so travelers said, come to one Francis \\n\\nGerard of Utah, AOL. \\n\\nThe Saint\\'s advocate was warmly greeted by the monks, \\n\\nwas lavishly served by six young novices instructed to be \\n\\nresponsive to his every whim, although, as it turned out, \\n\\nMonsignor Aguerra was a man of few whims, to the \\n\\ndisappointment of would-be caterers. The finest wines \\n\\nwere opened; Aguerra sipped them politely but preferred \\n\\nmilk. Brother Huntsman snared plump quail and chaparral \\n\\ncocks for the guest\\'s table; but after inquiring about the \\n\\nfeeding habits of the chaparral cocks (\"Corn fed, \\n\\nBrother?\"– \"No, snakefed, Messer\"), Monsignor Aguerra \\n\\nseemed to prefer monks-gruel in the refectory. If only he \\n\\nhad inquired about the anonymous bits of meat in the \\n\\nstews, he might have preferred the truly succulent \\n\\nchaparral cocks. Malfreddo Aguerra insisted that life go on \\n\\nas usual at the abbey. But, nevertheless, the advocate was \\n\\nentertained each evening at recreation by fiddlers and a \\n\\ntroupe of clowns until he began to believe that \"life as \\n\\nusual\" at the abbey must be extraordinarily lively, as lives \\n\\nof monastic communities go. \\n\\nOn the third day of Aguerra\\'s visit, the abbot summoned \\n\\nBrother Francis. The relationship between the monk and \\n\\nhis ruler, while not close, had been formally friendly, since \\n\\nthe time the abbot permitted the novice to profess his \\n\\nvows, and Brother Francis was not even trembling when he \\n\\nknocked at the study door and asked: \"You sent for me, \\n\\nReverend Father?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, I did,\" Arkos said, then asked evenly: \"Tell me, have \\n\\nyou ever thought about death?\" \\n\\n\"Frequently, m\\'Lord Abbot.\" \\n\\n\"You pray to Saint Joseph that your death will not be an \\n\\nunhappy one?\" \\n\\n\"Umm– often, Reverend Father.\"  \\n\\n\"Then I suppose you\\'d not care to be suddenly stricken? To \\n\\nhave someone use your guts to string a fiddle? To be fed \\n\\nto the hogs? To have your bones be buried in \\n\\nunconsecrated ground? Eh?\" \\n\\n\"Nnn-noo, Magister meus.\" \\n\\nMonsignor Aguerra.\" \\n\\n\"I– ?\" \\n\\n\"You.\" Arkos rubbed his chin and seemed lost in unhappy \\n\\nspeculation. \"I can see it too clearly. The Leibowitz cause is \\n\\nshelved. Poor Brother is struck down by a falling brick. \\n\\nThere he lies, moaning for absolution. In the very midst of \\n\\nus, mind you. And there we stand, looking down in pity– \\n\\nclergy among us– watching him croak his last, without \\n\\neven a last blessing on the lad. Hellbound. Unblessed. \\n\\nUnshrived. Under our very noses. A pity, eh?\" \\n\\n\"M\\'Lord?\" Francis squawked. \\n\\n\"Oh, don\\'t blame me. I\\'ll be too busy trying to keep your  \\n\\nbrothers from carrying out their impulse to kick you to \\n\\ndeath.\" \\n\\n\"When?\" \\n\\n\"Why not at all, we hope. Because you are going to be \\n\\ncareful, aren\\'t you?– about what you say to the monsignor. \\n\\nOtherwise I may let them kick you to death.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, but– \" \\n\\n\"The postulator wants to see you at once. Please stifle your \\n\\nimagination, and be certain about what you say. Please try \\n\\nnot to think.\" \\n\\n\"Well, I think I can.\" \\n\\n\"Out, son, out.\" \\n\\nFrancis felt fright when he first tapped at Aguerra\\'s door, \\n\\nbut he saw quickly that the fright was unfounded. The \\n\\nprothonotary was a suave and diplomatic elder who \\n\\nseemed keenly interested in the small monk\\'s life.  \\n\\nAfter several minutes of preliminary amenities, he \\n\\napproached the slippery subject: \"Now, about your \\n\\nencounter with the person who may have been the Blessed \\n\\nFounder of– \" \\n\\n\"Oh, but I never said he was our Blessed Leibo. . .\" \\n\\n\"Of course you didn\\'t, my son. Of course you didn\\'t. Now I \\n\\nhave here an account of the incident– gathered purely \\n\\nfrom hearsay sources, of course– and I\\'d like for you to \\n\\nread it, and then either confirm it or correct it.\" He paused \\n\\nto draw a scroll from his case; he handed it to Brother \\n\\nFrancis. \"This version is based on travelers\\' stories,\" he \\n\\nadded. \"Only you can describe what happened– first hand– \\n\\nso I want you to edit it most scrupulously.\" \\n\\n\"Certainly, Messer. But what happened was really very \\n\\nsimple– \" \\n\\n\"Read, read! Then we\\'ll talk about it, eh?\" \\n\\nThe fatness of the scroll made it apparent that the hearsay \\n\\naccount was not \"really very simple.\" Brother Francis read \\n\\nwith mounting apprehension. The apprehension soon grew \\n\\nto the proportions of horror. \\n\\n\"You look white, son,\" said the postulator. \"Is something \\n\\ntroubling you?\" \\n\\n\"Messer, this– it wasn\\'t like this at all!\" \\n\\n\"No? But indirectly at least, you must have been the \\n\\nauthor of it. How could it have been otherwise? Weren\\'t \\n\\nyou the only witness?\" \\n\\nBrother Francis closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead. \\n\\nHe had told the simple truth to fellow novices. Fellow \\n\\nnovices had whispered among themselves. Novices had \\n\\ntold the story to travelers. Travelers had repeated it to \\n\\ntravelers. Until finally– this! Small wonder that Abbot \\n\\nArkos had enjoined discussion. If only he had never \\n\\nmentioned the pilgrim at all! \\n\\n\"He only spoke a few words to me. I saw him just that \\n\\nonce. He chased me with a stick, asked me the way to the \\n\\nabbey, and made marks on the rock where I found the \\n\\ncrypt. Then I never saw him again.\" \\n\\n\"No halo?\"  \\n\\n\"No, Messer.\"  \\n\\n\"No heavenly choir?\"  \\n\\n\"No!\"  \\n\\n\"What about the carpet of roses that grew up where he  \\n\\nwalked?\"  \\n\\n\"No, no! Nothing like that, Messer,\" the monk gasped.  \\n\\n\"He didn\\'t write his name on the rock?\"  \\n\\n\"As God is my judge, Messer, he only made those two  \\n\\nmarks. I didn\\'t know what they meant.\"  \\n\\n\"Ah, well,\" sighed the postulator. \"Travelers\\' stories are  \\n\\nalways exaggerated. But I wonder how it all got started. \\n\\nNow suppose you tell me how it really happened.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis told him quite briefly. Aguerra seemed \\n\\nsaddened. After a thoughtful silence, he took the fat scroll, \\n\\ngave it a parting pat, and dropped it into the waste-bin. \\n\\n\"There goes miracle number seven,\" he grunted. \\n\\nFrancis hastened to apologize. \\n\\nThe advocate brushed it aside. \"Don\\'t give it a second \\n\\nthought. We really have enough evidence. There are \\n\\nseveral spontaneous cures– several cases of instantaneous \\n\\nrecovery from illness caused by the intercession of the \\n\\nBeatus. They\\'re simple, matter of fact, and well \\n\\ndocumented. They\\'re what cases for canonization are built \\n\\non. Of course they lack the poetry of this story, but I\\'m \\n\\nalmost glad it\\'s unfounded– glad for your sake. The devil\\'s \\n\\nadvocate would have crucified you, you know.\" \\n\\n\"I never said anything like– \" \\n\\n\"I understand, I understand! It all started because of the \\n\\nshelter. We reopened it today, by the way.\" \\n\\nFrancis brightened. \"Did– did you find anything more of \\n\\nSaint Leibowitz?\" \\n\\n\"Blessed Leibowitz, please!\" monsignor corrected. \"No, not \\n\\nyet. We opened the inner chamber. Had a devil of a time \\n\\ngetting it unsealed. Fifteen skeletons inside and many \\n\\nfascinating artifacts. Apparently the woman– it was a \\n\\nwoman, by the way– whose remains you found was \\n\\nadmitted to the outer chamber, but the inner chamber was \\n\\nalready full. Possibly it would have provided some degree \\n\\nof protection if a falling wall hadn\\'t caused the cave-in. The \\n\\nthe entrance. Heaven knows why the door wasn\\'t designed \\n\\nto swing inward.\" \\n\\n\"The woman in the antechamber, was she Emily \\n\\nLeibowitz?\" \\n\\nAguerra smiled. \"Can we prove it? I don\\'t know yet. I \\n\\nbelieve she was, yes– I believe– but perhaps I\\'m letting \\n\\nhope run away with reason. We\\'ll see what we can uncover \\n\\nyet; we\\'ll see. The other side has a witness present. I can\\'t \\n\\njump to conclusions.\" \\n\\nDespite his disappointment at Francis\\' account of the \\n\\nmeeting with the pilgrim, Aguerra remained friendly \\n\\nenough. He spent ten days at the archaeological site \\n\\nbefore returning to New Rome, and he left two of his \\n\\nassistants behind to supervise further excavation. On the \\n\\nday of his departure, he visited Brother Francis in the \\n\\nscriptorium. \\n\\n\"They tell me you were working on a document to  \\n\\ncommemorate the relics you found,\" said the postulator. \\n\\n\"Judging by the descriptions I\\'ve heard, I think I should \\n\\nvery much like to see it.\" \\n\\nThe monk protested that it was really nothing, but he went \\n\\nimmediately to fetch it, with such eagerness that his hands \\n\\nwere trembling as he unpacked the lambskin. Joyfully he \\n\\nobserved that Brother Jeris was looking on, while wearing \\n\\na nervous frown. \\n\\nThe monsignor stared for many seconds. \"Beautiful!\" he \\n\\nexploded at last. \"What glorious color! It\\'s superb, superb. \\n\\nFinish it– Brother, finish it!\" \\n\\nBrother Francis looked up at Brother Jeris and smiled \\n\\nquestioningly. \\n\\nThe master of the copyroom turned quickly away. The \\n\\nback of his neck grew red. On the following day, Francis \\n\\nunpacked his quills, dyes, gold leaf, and resumed his labor \\n\\non the illuminated diagram. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter  \\n\\nChapter Nine  \\n\\nA few months after the departure of Monsignor Aguerra, \\n\\nthere came a second donkey train– with a full complement \\n\\nof clerks and armed guards for defense against \\n\\nhighwaymen, mutant maniacs, and rumored dragons– to \\n\\nthe abbey from New Rome. This time the expedition was \\n\\nheaded by a monsignor with small horns and pointy fangs, \\n\\nwho announced that he was charged with the duty of \\n\\nopposing the canonization of the Blessed Leibowitz, and \\n\\nthat he had come to investigate– and perhaps fix \\n\\nresponsibility for, he hinted– certain incredible and \\n\\nhysterical rumors which had filtered out of the abbey and \\n\\nlamentably reached even the gates of New Rome. He made \\n\\nit evident that he would tolerate no romantic nonsense, as \\n\\na certain earlier visitor perhaps had done. \\n\\nThe abbot greeted him politely and offered him an iron cot \\n\\nin a cell with a south exposure, after apologizing for the \\n\\nfact that the guest suite had been recently exposed to \\n\\nsmallpox. The monsignor was attended by his own staff, \\n\\nand ate mush and herbs with the monks in the refectory– \\n\\nquail and chaparral cocks being unaccountably scarce that \\n\\nseason, so the huntsmen reported. \\n\\nThis time, the abbot did not feel it necessary to warn \\n\\nFrancis against any too liberal exercise of his imagination. \\n\\nLet him exercise it, if he dared. There was small danger of \\n\\nthe advocatus diaboli giving immediate credence even to \\n\\nthe truth, without first giving it a thorough thrashing and \\n\\nthrusting his fingers into its wounds. \\n\\n\"I understand you are prone to fainting spells,\" said \\n\\nMonsignor Flaught when he had Brother Francis alone and \\n\\nhad fixed him with what Francis decided was a malign \\n\\nglare. \"Tell me, is there any epilepsy in your family? \\n\\nMadness? Mutant neural patterns?\" \\n\\n\"None, Excellency.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m not an \\'Excellency,\\'\" snapped the priest \"Now, we\\'re \\n\\ngoing to get the truth out of you.\" A little simple straight \\n\\nforward surgery should be adequate, his tone seemed to \\n\\nimply, with only a minor amputation being required. \\n\\n\"Are you aware that documents can be artificially aged?\" \\n\\nhe demanded. \\n\\nBrother Francis was not so aware. \\n\\n\"Do you realize that the name, Emily, did not appear  \\n\\namong the papers you found?\"  \\n\\n\"Oh, but it– \" He paused, suddenly uncertain.  \\n\\n\"The name which appeared was Em, was it not?– which  \\n\\nmight be a diminutive for Emily?\"  \\n\\n\"I– I believe that is correct, Messer.\"  \\n\\n\"But it might also be a diminutive for Emma, might it not?  \\n\\nAnd the name Emma DID appear in the box!\"  \\n\\nFrancis was silent.  \\n\\n\"Well?\"  \\n\\n\"What was the question, Messer?\"  \\n\\n\"Never mind! I just thought I\\'d tell you that the evidence  \\n\\nsuggests that \\'Em\\' was for Emma, and \\'Emma\\' was not a  \\n\\ndiminutive of Emily. What do you say to that?\"  \\n\\n\"I had no previous opinion on the subject, Messer, but– \"  \\n\\n\"But what?\"  \\n\\n\"Aren\\'t husband and wife often careless about what they \\n\\ncall each other?\" \\n\\n\"ARE YOU BEING FLIPPANT WITH ME?\" \\n\\n\"No, Messer.\" \\n\\n\"Now, tell the truth! How did you happen to discover that \\n\\nshelter, and what is this fantastic twaddle about an \\n\\napparition?\" \\n\\nBrother Francis attempted to explain. The advocatus \\n\\ndiaboli interrupted with periodic snorts and sarcastic \\n\\nqueries, and when he was finished, the advocate raked at \\n\\nhis story with semantic tooth and nail until Francis himself \\n\\nwondered if he had really seen the old man or had \\n\\nimagined the incident. \\n\\nThe cross-examining technique was ruthless, but Francis \\n\\nfound the experience less frightening than an interview \\n\\nwith the abbot. The devil\\'s advocate could do no worse \\n\\nthan tear him limb from limb this one time, and the \\n\\nknowledge that the operation would soon be over helped \\n\\nthe amputee to bear the pain. When facing the abbot,  \\n\\nhowever, Francis was always aware that a blunder could \\n\\nbe punished again and again, Arkos being his ruler for a \\n\\nlifetime and the perpetual inquisitor of his soul. \\n\\nAnd Monsignor Flaught seemed to find the monk\\'s story \\n\\ntoo distressingly simple-minded to warrant full-scale \\n\\nattack, after observing Brother Francis\\' reaction to the \\n\\ninitial onslaught. \\n\\n\"Well, Brother, if that\\'s your story and you stick to it, I \\n\\ndon\\'t think we\\'ll be bothered with you at all. Even if it\\'s \\n\\ntrue– which I don\\'t admit– it\\'s so trivial it\\'s silly. Do you \\n\\nrealize that?\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s what I always thought, Messer,\" sighed Brother \\n\\nFrancis, who had for many years tried to detach the \\n\\nimportance which others had attached to the pilgrim. \\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s high time you said so!\" Flaught snapped. \\n\\n\"I always said that I thought he was probably just an old \\n\\nman.\" Monsignor Flaught covered his eyes with his hand \\n\\nand sighed heavily. His experience with uncertain \\n\\nwitnesses led him to say no more. \\n\\nSaint\\'s advocate before him, stopped at the scriptorium \\n\\nand asked to see the illuminated commemoration of the \\n\\nLeibowitz blueprint (\"that dreadful incomprehensibility\" as \\n\\nFlaught called it). This time the monk\\'s hands trembled not \\n\\nwith eagerness but with fear, for once again he might be \\n\\nforced to abandon the project. Monsignor Flaught gazed at \\n\\nthe lambskin in silence. He swallowed thrice. At last he \\n\\nforced himself to nod. \\n\\nthat, didn\\'t we?\" He paused. \"You\\'ve been working on it \\n\\nhow long now?\" \\n\\n\"Six years, Messer– intermittently.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, well, it would seem that you have at least as many \\n\\nyears to go.\" \\n\\nMonsignor Flaught\\'s horns immediately shortened by an \\n\\nsame evening for New Rome. \\n\\nThe years flowed smoothly by, seaming the faces of the \\n\\nyoung and adding gray to their temples. The perpetual \\n\\nlabor of the monastery continued, daily storming heaven  \\n\\nwith the ever-recurring hymn of the Divine Office, daily \\n\\nsupplying the world with a slow trickle of copied and \\n\\nrecopied manuscript, occasionally renting clerks and \\n\\nscribes to the episcopate, to ecclesiastical tribunals, and to \\n\\nsuch few secular powers as would hire them. Brother Jeris \\n\\ndeveloped ambitions of building a printing press, but Arkos \\n\\nquashed the plan when he heard of it. There was neither \\n\\nsufficient paper nor proper ink available, nor any demand \\n\\nfor inexpensive books in a world smug in its illiteracy. The \\n\\ncopyroom continued with pot and quill. \\n\\nOn the Feast of the Five Holy Fools, a Vatican messenger \\n\\narrived with glad tidings for the Order. Monsignor Flaught \\n\\nhad withdrawn all objections and was doing penance \\n\\nbefore an ikon of the Beatus Leibowitz. Monsignor \\n\\nAguerra\\'s case was proved; the Pope had directed that a \\n\\ndecree be issued recommending canonization. The date for \\n\\nthe formal proclamation was set for the coming Holy Year, \\n\\nand was to coincide with the calling of a General Council of \\n\\nthe Church for the purpose of making a careful \\n\\nrestatement of doctrine concerning the limitation of the \\n\\nmagisterium to matters of faith and morals; it was a \\n\\nquestion which had been settled many times in history, but \\n\\nit seemed to re-arise in new forms in every century, \\n\\nespecially in those dark periods when man\\'s \"knowledge\" \\n\\nof wind, stars, and rain was really only belief. During the \\n\\ntime of the council, the founder of the Albertian Order \\n\\nwould be enrolled in the Calendar of Saints. \\n\\nThe announcement was followed by a period of rejoicing at \\n\\nthe abbey. Dom Arkos, now withered by age and close to \\n\\ndotage, summoned Brother Francis into his presence and \\n\\nwheezed: \\n\\n\"His Holiness invites us to New Rome for the canonization. \\n\\nPrepare to leave.\" \\n\\n\"I, m\\'Lord?\" \\n\\n\"You alone. Brother Pharmacist forbids me to travel, and it \\n\\nwould not be well for Father Prior to leave while I am ill. \\n\\n\"Now don\\'t faint on me again,\" Dom Arkos added \\n\\nquerulously. \"You\\'re probably getting more credit than you \\n\\ndeserve for the fact that the court accepted the death date \\n\\nof Emily Leibowitz as conclusively proved. But His Holiness \\n\\ninvited you anyway. I suggest you thank God and claim no \\n\\ncredit.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis tottered. \"His Holiness . . .  \\n\\n\"Yes. Now, we\\'re sending the original Leibowitz blueprint to \\n\\nthe Vatican. What do you think about taking along your \\n\\nFather?\" \\n\\n\"Uh,\" said Francis. \\n\\nThe abbot revived him, blessed him, called him a good \\n\\nsimpleton, and sent him to pack his bindlestiff. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Ten  \\n\\nThe trip to New Rome would require at least three months, \\n\\nperhaps longer, the time depending to some extent on the \\n\\ndistance which Francis could cover before the inevitable \\n\\nband of robbers relieved him of his ass. He would be \\n\\ntraveling alone and unarmed, carrying only his bindlestiff \\n\\nand begging bowl in addition to the relic and its illuminated \\n\\nreplica. He prayed that ignorant robbers would have no \\n\\nuse for the latter; for, indeed, among the bandits of the \\n\\nwayside were sometimes kindly thieves who took only \\n\\nwhat was of value to them, and permitted their victim to \\n\\nretain his life, carcass, and personal effects. Others were \\n\\nless considerate. \\n\\nAs a precaution, Brother Francis wore a black patch over \\n\\nhis right eye. The peasants were a superstitious lot and \\n\\ncould often be routed by even a hint of the evil eye. Thus \\n\\narmed and equipped, he set out to obey the summons of \\n\\nthe Sacerdos Magnus, that Most Holy Lord and Ruler, Leo \\n\\nPappas XXI. \\n\\nNearly two months after leaving the abbey, the monk met \\n\\nhis robber on a heavily wooded mountain trail, far from \\n\\nany human settlement except the Valley of the Misborn, \\n\\nwhich lay a few miles beyond a peak to the west, where, \\n\\nleperlike, a colony of the genetically monstrous lived in \\n\\nseclusion from the world. There were some such colonies \\n\\nwhich were supervised by hospitalers of Holy Church, but \\n\\nthe Valley of the Misborn was not among them. Sports who \\n\\nhad escaped death at the hands of the forest tribes had \\n\\ncongregated there several centuries ago. Their ranks were \\n\\ncontinually replenished by warped and crawling things that \\n\\nsought refuge from the world, but some among them were \\n\\nfertile and gave birth. Often such children inherited the \\n\\nmonstrosity of the parent stock. Often they were born \\n\\ndead or never reached maturity. But occasionally the \\n\\nmonstrous trait was recessive, and an apparently normal \\n\\nchild resulted from the union of sports. Sometimes, \\n\\nhowever, the superficially \"normal\" offspring were blighted \\n\\nthem, seemingly, of the essence of humanity while leaving \\n\\nthem its appearances. Even within the Church, some had \\n\\ndared espouse the view that such creatures truly had been \\n\\ndeprived of the Dei imago from conception, that their souls \\n\\nwere but animal souls, that they might with impunity \\n\\nunder the Natural Law be destroyed as animal and not \\n\\nMan, that God had visited animal issue upon the species as \\n\\na punishment for the sins that had nearly destroyed \\n\\nhumankind. Few theologians whose belief in Hell had never \\n\\nfailed them would deprive their God of recourse to any \\n\\nform of temporal punishment, but for men to take it upon \\n\\nthemselves to judge any creature born of woman to be \\n\\nlacking in the divine image was to usurp the privilege of \\n\\nHeaven. Even the idiot which seems less gifted than a dog, \\n\\nor a pig, or a goat, shall, if born of woman, be called an \\n\\nimmortal soul, thundered the magisterium, and thundered \\n\\nit again and again. After several such pronouncements, \\n\\naimed at curbing infanticide, had issued from New Rome, \\n\\nthe luckless misborn had come to be called the \"Pope\\'s \\n\\nnephews,\" or the \"Pope\\'s children,\" by some. \\n\\n\"Let that which is born alive of human parents be suffered \\n\\nto live,\" the previous Leo had said, \"in accordance with \\n\\nboth the Natural Law and the Divine Law of Love; let it be \\n\\ncherished as Child and nurtured, whatever its form and \\n\\ndemeanor, for it is a fact available to natural reason alone, \\n\\nunaided by Divine Revelation, that among the Natural \\n\\nRights of Man the right to parental assistance in an \\n\\nattempt to survive is precedent to all other rights, and may \\n\\nnot be modified legitimately by Society or State except \\n\\ninsofar as Princes are empowered to implement that right. \\n\\nNot even the beasts of the Earth act otherwise.\" \\n\\nThe robber that accosted Brother Francis was not in any \\n\\nobvious way one of the malformed, but that he came from \\n\\nthe Valley of the Misborn was made evident when two \\n\\nslope that overlooked the trail and hooted mockingly at the \\n\\nmonk from ambush, while aiming at him with drawn bows. \\n\\nFrom such a distance, Francis was not certain of his first \\n\\nimpression that one hand grasped a bow with six fingers or \\n\\nan extra thumb; but there was no doubt at all that one of \\n\\nthe robed figures was wearing a robe with two hoods, \\n\\nalthough he could make out no faces, nor could he \\n\\ndetermine whether the extra hood contained an extra head \\n\\nor not. \\n\\nThe robber himself stood in the trail directly ahead. He was \\n\\na short man, but heavy as a bull, with a glazed knob of a \\n\\npate and a jaw like a block of granite. He stood in the trail \\n\\nwith his legs spread wide and his massive arms folded \\n\\nacross his chest while he watched the approach of the \\n\\nsmall figure astride the ass. The robber, as best Brother \\n\\nFrancis could see, was armed only with his own brawn and \\n\\na knife which he did not bother to remove from his \\n\\nbelt-thong. He beckoned Francis forward. When the monk \\n\\nstopped fifty yards away, one of the Pope\\'s children \\n\\nunleashed an arrow; the missile whipped into the trail just \\n\\nbehind the donkey, causing the animal to spurt ahead.  \\n\\n\"Get off,\" the robber ordered. \\n\\nThe ass stopped in the path. Brother Francis tossed back \\n\\nhis hood to reveal the eye patch and raised a trembling \\n\\nfinger to touch it. He began lifting the patch slowly from \\n\\nhis eye. \\n\\nThe robber tossed back his head and laughed a laugh that \\n\\nmight have sprung, Francis thought, from the throat of \\n\\nSatan; the monk muttered an exorcism, but the robber \\n\\nappeared untouched. \\n\\n\"You black-sacked jeebers wore that one out years ago,\" \\n\\nbe said. \"Now get off.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis smiled, shrugged, and dismounted without \\n\\nfurther protest. The robber inspected the donkey, patting \\n\\nits flanks, examining teeth and hooves. \\n\\n\"Eat? Eat?\" cried one of the robed creatures on the hillside. \\n\\n\"Not this time,\" barked the robber. \"Too scrawny.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis was not entirely convinced that they were \\n\\ntalking about the donkey. \\n\\n\"Good day to you, sir,\" the monk said pleasantly. \"You \\n\\nmay take the ass. Walking will improve my health, I \\n\\nthink.\" He smiled again and started away. \\n\\nAn arrow slashed into the trail at his feet. \\n\\n\"Stop that!\" howled the robber, then to Francis: \"Now \\n\\nstrip. And let\\'s see what\\'s in that roll and in the package.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis touched his begging bowl and made a \\n\\ngesture of helplessness, which brought only another \\n\\nscornful laugh from the robber. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve seen that alms-pot trick before too,\" he said. \"The \\n\\nlast man with a bowl had half a heklo of gold hidden in his \\n\\nboot. Now strip.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis, who was not wearing boots, hopefully \\n\\ndisplayed his sandals, but the robber gestured impatiently. \\n\\nThe monk untied his bindlestiff, spread its contents for \\n\\ndisplay, and began to undress. The robber searched his \\n\\nclothing, found nothing, and tossed the clothing back to its \\n\\nowner, who breathed his gratitude; he had been expecting \\n\\nto be left naked on the trail. \\n\\n\"Now let\\'s see inside that other package.\" \\n\\n\"It contains only documents, sir,\" the monk protested. \"Of \\n\\nvalue to no one except the owner.\" \\n\\n\"Open it.\" \\n\\nSilently Brother Francis untied the package and unwrapped \\n\\nthe original blueprint and the illuminated commemoration \\n\\nthereof. The gold-leaf inlay and the colorful design flashed \\n\\nbrilliantly in the sunlight that filtered through the foliage. \\n\\nThe robber\\'s craggy jaw dropped an inch. He whistled \\n\\nsoftly. \\n\\n\"What a pretty! Now wouldn\\'t the woman like that to hang \\n\\non the cabin wall!\" \\n\\nFrancis went sick inside. \\n\\n\"Gold!\" the robber shouted to his robed accomplices on the \\n\\nhill. \\n\\n\"Eat? Eat?\" came the gurgling and chortling reply.  \\n\\n\"We\\'ll eat, never fear!\" called the robber, then explained \\n\\nconversationally to Francis: \"They get hungry after a \\n\\ncouple of days just sitting there. Business is bad. Traffic\\'s \\n\\nlight these days.\" \\n\\nFrancis nodded. The robber resumed his admiration of the \\n\\nilluminated replica. \\n\\nLord, if Thou hast sent him to test me, then help me to die \\n\\nlike a man, that he may take it only over the dead body of \\n\\nThy servant. Holy Leibowitz, see this deed and pray for \\n\\nme– \"What is it?\" the robber asked. \"A charm?\" He \\n\\nstudied the two documents together for a time. \"Oh! One \\n\\nis a ghost of the other. What magic is this?\" He stared at \\n\\nBrother Francis with suspicious gray eyes. \"What is it \\n\\ncalled?\" \\n\\n\"Uh– Transistorized Control System for Unit Six-B,\" the \\n\\nmonk stammered. \\n\\nThe robber, who had been looking at the documents \\n\\nupside down, could nevertheless see that one diagram \\n\\ninvolved a figure-background reversal of the other– an \\n\\neffect which seemed to intrigue him as much as the gold \\n\\nleaf. He traced out the similarities in design with a short \\n\\nand dirty forefinger, leaving a faint smudge on the \\n\\nilluminated lambskin. Francis held back tears. \\n\\n\"Please!\" the monk gasped. \"The gold is so thin, it\\'s worth \\n\\nnothing to speak of. Weigh it in your hand. The whole \\n\\nthing weighs no more than the paper itself. It\\'s of no use \\n\\nto you. Please, sir, take my clothing instead. Take the \\n\\nleave me these. They mean nothing to you.\" \\n\\nThe robber\\'s gray gaze was meditative. He watched the \\n\\nmonk\\'s agitation and rubbed his jaw. \"I\\'ll let you keep your \\n\\nclothes and your donkey and everything except this,\" he \\n\\noffered. \"I\\'ll just take the charms, then.\" \\n\\n\"For the love of God, sir, then kill me too!\" Brother Francis \\n\\nwailed. \\n\\nThe robber snickered. \"We\\'ll see. Tell me what they\\'re for.\" \\n\\n\"Nothing. One is a memento of a man long dead. An \\n\\nancient. The other is only a copy.\" \\n\\n\"What good are they to you?\" \\n\\nFrancis closed his eyes for a moment and tried to think of \\n\\na way to explain. \"You know the forest tribes? How they \\n\\nvenerate their ancestors?\" \\n\\nThe gray eyes of the robber flashed angrily for a moment. \\n\\n\"We despise our ancestors,\" he barked. \"Cursed be they \\n\\nwho gave us birth!\" \\n\\n\"Cursed, cursed!\" echoed one of the shrouded archers on \\n\\nthe hillside. \\n\\n\"You know who we are? Where we are from?\" \\n\\nFrancis nodded. \"I meant no offense. The ancient whose \\n\\nrelic this is– he is not our ancestor. He was our teacher of \\n\\nold. We venerate his memory. This is only like a keepsake, \\n\\nno more.\" \\n\\n\"What about the copy?\" \\n\\n\"I made it myself. Please, sir, it took me fifteen years. It\\'s \\n\\nnothing to you. Please– you wouldn\\'t take fifteen years of \\n\\na man\\'s life– for no reason?\" \\n\\n\"Fifteen years?\" The robber threw back his head and \\n\\nhowled with laughter. \"You spent fifteen years making \\n\\nthat?\" \\n\\n\"Oh, but– \" Francis was suddenly silent. His eyes swung \\n\\ntoward the robber\\'s stubby forefinger. The finger was \\n\\ntapping the original blueprint. \\n\\n\"That took you fifteen years? And it\\'s almost ugly beside \\n\\nthe other.\" He slapped his paunch and between guffaws \\n\\nkept pointing at the relic. \"Ha! Fifteen years! So that\\'s \\n\\nwhat you do way out there! Why? What is the dark \\n\\nghost-image good for? Fifteen years to make that! Ho ho! \\n\\nWhat a woman\\'s work!\" \\n\\nrobber should mistake the sacred relic itself for the copy of \\n\\nthe relic left him too shocked to reply. \\n\\nStill laughing, the robber took both documents in his hands \\n\\nand prepared to rip them both in half. \\n\\n\"Jesus, Mary, Joseph!\" the monk screamed and went to his \\n\\nknees in the trail. \"For the love of God, sir!\" \\n\\nThe robber tossed the papers on the ground. \"I\\'ll wrestle \\n\\nyou for them,\" he offered sportingly. \"Those against my \\n\\nblade.\" \\n\\n\"Done,\" said Francis impulsively, thinking that a contest \\n\\nwould at least afford Heaven a chance to intervene in an \\n\\nunobtrusive way. O God, Thou who strengthened Jacob so \\n\\nthat he overcame the angel on the rock. . . \\n\\nThey squared off. Brother Francis crossed himself. The \\n\\nrobber took his knife from his belt-thong and tossed it \\n\\nafter the papers. They circled. \\n\\nThree seconds later, the monk lay groaning on the flat of \\n\\nhis back under a short mountain of muscle. A sharp rock \\n\\nseemed to be severing his spine. \\n\\n\"Heh-heh,\" said the robber, and arose to reclaim his knife \\n\\nand roll up the documents. \\n\\nHands folded as if in prayer, Brother Francis crept after \\n\\nhim on his knees, begging at the top of his lungs. \"Please, \\n\\nthen, take only one, not both! Please!\" \\n\\n\"You\\'ve got to buy it back now,\" the robber chortled. \"I \\n\\nwon them fair enough.\"  \\n\\n\"I have nothing, I am poor!\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s all right, if you want them that bad, you\\'ll get gold. \\n\\nTwo heklos of gold, that\\'s the ransom. Bring it here any \\n\\ntime. I\\'ll tuck your things in my shanty. You want them \\n\\nback, just bring the gold.\" \\n\\n\"Listen, they\\'re important to other people, not to me. I was \\n\\ntaking them to the Pope. Maybe they\\'ll pay you for the \\n\\nimportant one. But let me have the other one just to show \\n\\nthem. It\\'s of no importance at all.\" \\n\\nThe robber laughed over his shoulder. \"I believe you\\'d kiss \\n\\na boot to get it back.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis caught up with him and fervently kissed his \\n\\nboot. \\n\\nThis proved too much for even such a fellow as the robber. \\n\\nHe shoved the monk away with his foot, separated the two \\n\\npapers, and flung one of them in Francis\\' face with a curse. \\n\\nHe climbed aboard the monk\\'s donkey and started riding it \\n\\nup the slope toward the ambush. Brother Francis snatched \\n\\nup the precious document and hiked along beside the \\n\\nrobber, thanking him profusely and blessing him \\n\\nrepeatedly while the robber guided the ass toward the \\n\\nshrouded archers. \\n\\n\"Fifteen years!\" the robber snorted, and again shoved \\n\\nFrancis away with his foot. \"Begone!\" He waved the \\n\\nheklos of gold\\'ll ransom your keepsake. And tell your Pope \\n\\nI won it fair.\" \\n\\nFrancis stopped climbing. He sent a glowing cross of \\n\\nbenediction after the departing bandit and quietly praised \\n\\nGod for the existence of such selfless robbers, who could \\n\\nmake such an ignorant mistake. He fondled the original \\n\\nblueprint lovingly as he hiked away down the trail. The \\n\\nrobber was proudly displaying the beautiful \\n\\ncommemoration to his mutant companions on the hill. \\n\\n\"Eat! Eat!\" said one of them, petting the donkey. \\n\\n\"Ride, ride,\" corrected the robber. \"Eat later.\" \\n\\nBut when Brother Francis had left them far behind, a great \\n\\nsadness gradually engulfed him. The taunting voice still \\n\\nrang in his ears. Fifteen years! So that\\'s what you do over \\n\\nthere! Fifteen years! What a woman\\'s work! Ho ho ho ho. . \\n\\nThe robber had made a mistake. But the fifteen years were \\n\\ngone anyhow, and with it all the love and torment that had \\n\\ngone into the commemoration. \\n\\nCloistered as he had been, Francis had become \\n\\nunaccustomed to the ways of the outside world, to its \\n\\nharsh habits and curt attitudes. He found his heart deeply \\n\\ntroubled by the robber\\'s mockery. He thought of Brother \\n\\nJeris\\' gentler mockery of earlier years. Maybe Brother Jeris \\n\\nhad been right. \\n\\nHis head hung low in his hood as he traveled slowly on. \\n\\nAt least there was the original relic. At least. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Eleven  \\n\\nThe hour had come. Brother Francis, in his simple monk\\'s \\n\\nhabit, had never felt less important than at that moment, \\n\\nas he knelt in the majestic basilica before the beginning of \\n\\nthe ceremony. The stately movements, the vivid swirls of \\n\\ncolor, the sounds which accompanied the ceremonious \\n\\npreparations for ceremony, already seemed liturgical in \\n\\nspirit, making it difficult to bear in mind that nothing of \\n\\nimportance was happening yet. Bishops, monsignori, \\n\\ncardinals, priests, and various lay-functionaries in elegant, \\n\\nantiquated dress moved to and fro in the great church, but \\n\\ntheir comings and goings were graceful clockwork which \\n\\nnever paused, stumbled, or changed its mind to rush in \\n\\nthe other direction. A sampetrius entered the basilica; so \\n\\ngrandly was he attired that Francis at first mistook the \\n\\ncathedral workman for a prelate. The sampetrius carried a \\n\\nfootstool. He carried it with such casual pomp that the \\n\\nmonk, if he had not been kneeling, might have genuflected \\n\\nas the object drifted by. The sampetrius dropped to one \\n\\nknee before the high altar, then crossed to the papal \\n\\nthrone where he substituted the new footstool for one \\n\\nwhich seemed to have a loose leg; thereupon, he departed \\n\\nby the same route as he had come. Brother Francis \\n\\nmarveled at the studied elegance of movement that \\n\\naccompanied even the trivial. No one hurried. No one \\n\\nminced or fumbled. No motion occurred which did not \\n\\nof this ancient place, even as the motionless statues and \\n\\npaintings contributed to it. Even the whisper of one\\'s \\n\\nbreathing seemed to echo faintly from distant apses. \\n\\nTerribilis est locus iste: hic domus Del est, et porta caeli; \\n\\nterrible indeed, House of God, Gate of Heaven! \\n\\nSome of the statues were alive, he observed after a time. \\n\\nA suit of armor stood against the wall a few yards to his \\n\\nleft. Its mailed fist held the staff of a gleaming battle-ax. \\n\\nNot even the plume of its helmet had stirred during the \\n\\ntime Brother Francis had been kneeling there. A dozen \\n\\nidentical suits of armor stood at intervals along the walls. \\n\\nOnly after seeing a horsefly crawl through the visor of the \\n\\n\"statue\" on his left did he suspect that the warlike husk \\n\\ncontained an occupant. His eye could detect no motion, \\n\\nbut the armor emitted a few metallic creaks while it \\n\\nharbored the horsefly. These, then, must be the papal \\n\\nguard, so renowned in knightly battle: the small private \\n\\narmy of God\\'s First Vicar. \\n\\nA captain of the guard was making a stately tour of his \\n\\nmen. For the first time, the statue moved. It lifted its visor  \\n\\nin salute. The captain thoughtfully paused and used his \\n\\nkerchief to brush the horsefly from the forehead of the \\n\\nexpressionless face inside the helmet before passing on. \\n\\nThe statue lowered its visor and resumed its immobility. \\n\\nThe stately decor of the basilica was briefly marred by the \\n\\nentrance of pilgrim throngs. The throngs were well \\n\\nstrangers to this place. Most of them seemed to tread on \\n\\ntiptoe to their stations, cautious to create no sound and as \\n\\nlittle movement as possible, unlike the sampetrii and New \\n\\nRoman clergy who made sound and motion eloquent. Here \\n\\nand there among the pilgrims someone stifled a cough or \\n\\nstumbled. \\n\\nSuddenly the basilica became warlike, as the guard was \\n\\nstrengthened. A new troop of mailed statues tramped into \\n\\nthe sanctuary itself, dropped to one knee, and tilted their \\n\\npike-staffs, saluting the altar before taking their posts. \\n\\nTwo of them stood flanking the papal throne. A third fell to \\n\\nhis knees at the throne\\'s right hand; he remained kneeling \\n\\nthere with the sword of Peter lying across his upraised \\n\\npalms. The tableau became motionless again, except for \\n\\noccasional dancing of flame among the altar candies. \\n\\nUpon the hallowed silence burst a sudden peal of \\n\\ntrumpets. \\n\\nThe sound\\'s intensity mounted until the throbbing Ta-ra \\n\\nthe ears. The voice of the trumpets was not musical but \\n\\nannunciatory. The first notes began in mid-scale, then \\n\\nclimbed slowly in pitch, intensity, and urgency, until the \\n\\nmonk\\'s scalp crawled, and there seemed to be nothing at \\n\\nall in the basilica but the explosion of the tubas. \\n\\nThen, dead silence– followed by the cry of a tenor:\\n\\n FIRST CANTOR: \"Appropinquat agnis pastor\\n\\n et ovibus pascendis.\"\\n\\n SECOND CANTOR: \"Genua nunc flectantur omnia.\"\\n\\n FIRST CANTOR: \"Jussit olim Jesus Petrum\\n\\n pascere gregem Domini.\" \\n\\n SECOND CANTOR: \"Ecce Petrus Pontifex Maximus.\" \\n\\n FIRST CANTOR: \"Gaudeat igitur populus Christi, \\n\\net gratias agat Domino.\"\\n\\n SECOND CANTOR: \"Nam docebimur a Spiritu sancto.\"\\n\\n CHOIR:\"Ahleluia, ahleluia--\" \\n\\nThe crowd arose and then knelt in a slow wave that \\n\\nman in white who gestured his blessings to the people as \\n\\nthe gold, black, purple, and red procession moved him \\n\\nslowly toward the throne. Breath kept choking up in the \\n\\nthroat of the small monk from a distant abbey in a distant \\n\\ndesert. It was impossible to see everything that was \\n\\nhappening, so overwhelming was the tide of music and \\n\\nmotion, drowning one\\'s senses and sweeping the mind \\n\\nalong willynilly toward that which was soon to come. \\n\\nThe ceremony was brief. Its intensity would have become \\n\\nunendurable had it been longer. A monsignor– Malfreddo \\n\\nAguerra, the Saint\\'s advocate himself, Brother Francis \\n\\nobserved– approached the throne and knelt. After a brief \\n\\nsilence, he voiced his plea in plain chant. \\n\\n\"Sancte pater, ab Sapientia summa petimus ut ille Beatus \\n\\nLeibowitz cujus miracula mirati sunt multi. . \\n\\nThe request called upon Leo to enlighten his people by \\n\\nsolemn definition concerning the pious belief that the \\n\\nBeatus Leibowitz was indeed a saint, worthy of the dulia of \\n\\nthe Church as well as the veneration of the faithful. \\n\\n\"Gratissima Nobis causa, fili,\" the voice of the old man in \\n\\nwhite sang in response, explaining that his own heart\\'s \\n\\ndesire was to announce by solemn proclamation that the \\n\\nblessed Martyr was among the saints, but also that it was \\n\\nby divine guidance alone, sub ducatu sancti Spiritus, that \\n\\nhe might comply with Aguerra\\'s request. He asked all to \\n\\npray for that guidance. \\n\\nAgain the thunder of the choir filled the basilica with the \\n\\nLitany of the Saints: \"Father-of-Heaven, God, have mercy \\n\\non us. Son, Repurchaser-of-the-World, God, have mercy \\n\\non us. Ghost-Most-Holy, God, have mercy on us. O Sacred \\n\\nThreefoldhood, God-One-and-Only, miserere nobis! Holy \\n\\nSancta Virgo virginum, ora pro nobis . . .\" The thunder of \\n\\nthe litany continued. Francis looked up at a painting of the \\n\\nBlessed Leibowitz, newly unveiled. The fresco was of heroic \\n\\nproportions. It portrayed the trial of the Beatus before the \\n\\nmob, but the face was not wryly smiling as it smiled in \\n\\nFingo\\'s work. It was, however, majestic, Francis thought, \\n\\nand in keeping with the rest of the basilica. \\n\\n\"Omnes sancti Martyres, orate pro nobis. . .\" \\n\\nWhen the litany was finished, again Monsignor Maifreddo \\n\\nAguerra made his plea to the Pope, asking that the name \\n\\nof Isaac Edward Leibowitz be formally enrolled in the \\n\\nCalendar of Saints. Again the guiding Spirit was invoked, \\n\\nas the Pope chanted the Veni, Creator Spiritus. \\n\\nAnd yet a third time Malfreddo Aguerra pleaded for the \\n\\nproclamation. \\n\\n\"Surgat ergo Petrus ipse. . .\" \\n\\nAt last it came. The twenty-first Leo intoned the decision of \\n\\nthe Church, rendered under the guidance of the Holy \\n\\nSpirit, proclaiming the existing fact that an ancient and \\n\\nrather obscure technician named Leibowitz was truly a \\n\\nsaint in Heaven, whose powerful intercession might, and of \\n\\nright ought to be, reverently implored. A feast day was \\n\\nnamed for a Mass in his honor. \\n\\n\"Holy Leibowitz, intercede for us,\" Brother Francis breathed \\n\\nwith the others. \\n\\nAfter a brief prayer, the choir burst into the Te Deum. \\n\\nAfter a Mass honoring the new saint, it was finished. \\n\\nEscorted by two scarlet-liveried sedarii of the outer palace, \\n\\nthe small party of pilgrims passed through a seemingly \\n\\nendless sequence of corridors and antechambers, halting \\n\\noccasionally before the ornate table of some new official \\n\\nwho examined credentials and goose-quilled his signature \\n\\non a licet adire for a sedarius to hand to the next official, \\n\\nwhose title grew progressively longer and less \\n\\npronounceable as the party proceeded. Brother Francis \\n\\nwas shivering. Among his fellow pilgrims were two bishops, \\n\\na man wearing ermine and gold, a clan chief of the forest \\n\\npeople, converted but still wearing the panther skin tunic \\n\\nand panther headgear of his tribal totem, a leather-clad \\n\\nsimpleton carrying a hooded peregrine falcon on one \\n\\nwrist– evidently as a gift to the Holy Father– and several \\n\\nwomen, all of whom seemed to be wives or concubines– as \\n\\nbest Francis could judge by their actions– of the \\n\\n\"converted\" clan chief of the panther people; or perhaps \\n\\nthey were ex-concubines put away by canon but not by \\n\\ntribal custom. \\n\\nAfter climbing the scala caelestis, the pilgrims were \\n\\nwelcomed by the somberly clad cameralis gestor and \\n\\nushered into the small anteroom of the vast consistorial \\n\\nhall. \\n\\n\"The Holy Father will receive them here,\" the high-ranking \\n\\nlackey softly informed the sedarius who carried the \\n\\ncredentials. He glanced over the pilgrims, rather \\n\\ndisapprovingly, Francis thought. He whispered briefly to \\n\\nthe sedarius. The sedarius reddened and whispered to the \\n\\nclan chief. The clan chief glowered and removed his fanged \\n\\nand snarling headdress, letting the panther head dangle \\n\\nover his shoulder. There was a brief conference about \\n\\npositions, while His Supreme Unctuousness, the leading \\n\\nlackey, in tones so soft as to seem reproving, stationed his \\n\\nvisiting chess pieces about the room in accordance with \\n\\nsome arcane protocol which only the sedarii seemed to \\n\\nunderstand. \\n\\nThe Pope was not long in arriving. The little man in the \\n\\nwhite cassock, surrounded by his retinue, strode briskly \\n\\ninto the audience room. Brother Francis experienced a \\n\\nsudden dizzy spell. He remembered that Dom Arkos had \\n\\nthreatened to flay him alive if he fainted during the \\n\\naudience, and he steeled himself against it. \\n\\nThe line of pilgrims knelt. The old man in white gently \\n\\nbade them arise. Brother Francis finally found the courage \\n\\nto focus his eyes. In the basilica, the Pope had been only a \\n\\nradiant spot of white in a sea of color. Gradually, here in \\n\\nthe audience room, Brother Francis perceived at closer \\n\\nrange that the Pope was not, like the fabled nomads, nine \\n\\nfeet tall. To the monk\\'s surprise, the frail old man, Father \\n\\nof Princes and Kings, Bridge-Builder of the World, and \\n\\nVicar on Earth of Christ, appeared much less ferocious than \\n\\nDom Arkos, Abbas. \\n\\nThe Pope moved slowly along the line of pilgrims, greeting \\n\\neach, embracing one of the bishops, conversing with each \\n\\nin his own dialect or through an interpreter, laughing at \\n\\nthe expression of the monsignor to whom he transferred \\n\\nthe task of carrying the falconer\\'s bird, and addressing the \\n\\nclan leader of the forest people with a peculiar hand \\n\\ngesture and a grunted word of forest dialect which caused \\n\\nthat panther-clad chieftain to glow with a sudden grin of \\n\\ndelight. The Pope noticed the dangling panther headgear \\n\\nand paused to replace it on the tribesman\\'s head. The \\n\\nlatter\\'s chest bulged with pride; he glared about the room, \\n\\napparently to catch the eye of His Supreme Unctuousness, \\n\\nthe leading lackey, but that official seemed to have \\n\\nvanished into the woodwork. \\n\\nThe Pope drew nearer to Brother Francis. \\n\\nEcce Petrus Pontifex . . . Behold Peter, the high priest. Leo \\n\\nXXI, himself: \"Whom alone, God did appoint Prince over all \\n\\ncountries and kingdoms, to root up, pull down, waste, \\n\\ndestroy, plant, and build, that he might preserve a faithful \\n\\npeople– \" And yet in the face of Leo, the monk saw a \\n\\nkindly meekness which hinted that he was worthy of that \\n\\ntitle, loftier than any bestowed upon princes and kings, \\n\\nwhereby he was called \"the slave of the slaves of God.\" \\n\\nFrancis knelt quickly to kiss the Fisherman\\'s ring. As he \\n\\narose, he found himself clutching the relic of the Saint \\n\\nbehind him as if ashamed to display it. The Pontiff\\'s amber \\n\\neyes compelled him gently. Leo spoke softly in the curial \\n\\nmanner: an affectation which he seemed to dislike as \\n\\nburdensome, but which he practiced for custom\\'s sake in \\n\\nspeaking to visitors less savage than the panther chief. \\n\\n\"Our heart was deeply grieved when we heard of your \\n\\nmisfortune, dear son. An account of your journey reached \\n\\nour ears. At our own request you traveled here, but while \\n\\non your way, you were set upon by robbers. Is that not \\n\\ntrue?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, Holy Father. But it is really of no importance. I \\n\\nmean– It was important, except– \" Francis stammered. \\n\\nThe white old man smiled gently. \"We know that you \\n\\nbrought us a gift, and that it was stolen from you along the \\n\\nway. Be not troubled for that. Your presence is gift enough \\n\\nto us. Long have we cherished the hope of greeting in \\n\\nperson the discoverer of Emily Leibowitz\\' remains. We \\n\\nknow, too, of your labors at the abbey. For the Brothers of \\n\\nSaint Leibowitz, we have always felt a most fervent \\n\\naffection. Without your work, the world\\'s amnesia might \\n\\nwell be total. As the Church, Mysticum Christi Corpus, is a \\n\\nBody, so has your Order served as an organ of memory in \\n\\nthat Body. We owe much to your holy Patron and Founder. \\n\\nFuture ages may owe him even more. May we hear more \\n\\nof your journey, dear son?\" \\n\\nBrother Francis produced the blueprint. \"The highwayman \\n\\nwas kind enough to leave this in my keeping, Holy Father. \\n\\nHe– he mistook it for a copy of the illumination which I \\n\\nwas bringing as a gift.\" \\n\\n\"You did not correct his mistake?\" \\n\\nBrother Francis blushed. \"I\\'m ashamed to admit, Holy \\n\\nFather– \" \\n\\n\"This, then, is the original relic you found in the crypt?\" \\n\\n\"Yes– \" \\n\\nThe Pope\\'s smile became wry. \"So, then– the bandit \\n\\nthought your work was the treasure itself? Ah– even a \\n\\nrobber can have a keen eye for art, yes? Monsignor \\n\\nAguerra told us of the beauty of your commemoration. \\n\\nWhat a pity that it was stolen.\" \\n\\n\"It was nothing, Holy Father. I only regret that I wasted \\n\\nfifteen years.\" \\n\\n\"Wasted? How \\'wasted\\'? If the robber had not been misled \\n\\nby the beauty of your commemoration, he might have \\n\\ntaken this, might he not?\" \\n\\nBrother Francis admitted the possibility. \\n\\nThe twenty-first Leo took the ancient blueprint in his \\n\\nwithered hands and carefully unrolled it. He studied its \\n\\ndesign for a time in silence, then: \"Tell us, do you \\n\\nunderstand the symbols used by Leibowitz? The meaning \\n\\nof the, uh, thing represented?\" \\n\\n\"No, Holy Father, my ignorance is complete.\" \\n\\nThe Pope leaned toward him to whisper: \"So is ours.\" He \\n\\nchuckled, pressed his lips to the relic as if kissing an altar \\n\\nstone, then rerolled it and handed it to an attendant. \"We \\n\\nthank you from the bottom of our heart for those fifteen \\n\\nyears, beloved son,\" he added to Brother Francis. \"Those \\n\\nyears were spent to preserve this original. Never think of \\n\\nthem as wasted. Offer them to God. Someday the meaning \\n\\nof the original may be discovered, and may prove \\n\\nimportant.\" The old man blinked-or was it a wink? Francis \\n\\nwas almost convinced that the Pope had winked at him. \\n\\n\"We\\'ll have you to thank for that.\" \\n\\nThe wink, or the blink, seemed to bring the room into \\n\\nclearer focus for the monk. For the first time, he noticed a \\n\\nmoth-hole in the Pope\\'s cassock. The cassock itself was \\n\\nalmost threadbare. The carpet in the audience room was \\n\\nworn through in spots. Plaster had fallen from the ceiling in \\n\\nseveral places. But dignity had overshadowed poverty. \\n\\nOnly for a moment after the wink did Brother Francis \\n\\nnotice hints of poverty at all. The distraction was transient. \\n\\n\"By you, we wish to send our warmest regards to all \\n\\nmembers of your community and to your abbot,\" Leo was \\n\\nsaying. \"To them, as to you, we wish to extend our \\n\\napostolic benediction. We shall give you a letter to them \\n\\nannouncing the benediction.\" He paused, then blinked, or \\n\\nwinked, again. \"Quite incidentally, the letter will be \\n\\nsafeguarded. We shall affix to it the Noli molestare, \\n\\nexcommunicating anyone who waylays the bearer.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis murmured his thanks for such insurance \\n\\nagainst highwaymanship; he did not deem it fitting to add \\n\\nthat the robber would be unable to read the warning or \\n\\nunderstand the penalty. \"I shall do my best to deliver it, \\n\\nHoly Father.\"  \\n\\nAgain, Leo leaned close to whisper: \"And to you, we shall \\n\\ngive a special token of our affection. Before you leave, see \\n\\nMonsignor Aguerra. We would prefer to give it to you by \\n\\nour own hand, but this is not the proper moment. The \\n\\nmonsignor will present it for us. Do with it what you will.\" \\n\\n\"Thank you very much indeed, Holy Father.\" \\n\\n\"And now good-bye, beloved son.\" \\n\\nThe Pontiff moved on, speaking to each pilgrim in the line, \\n\\nand when it was over: the solemn benediction. The \\n\\naudience had ended. \\n\\nMonsignor Agmierra touched Brother Francis\\' arm as the \\n\\npilgrim group passed out the portals. He embraced the \\n\\nmonk warmly. The postulator of the Saint\\'s cause had \\n\\naged so greatly that Francis recognized him only with \\n\\ndifficulty at close range. But Francis, too, was gray at the \\n\\ntemples, and had grown wrinkled about the eyes from \\n\\nsquinting over the copy-table. The monsignor handed him \\n\\na package and a letter as they descended the scala \\n\\ncaetestis. Francis glanced at the letter\\'s address and \\n\\nnodded. His own name was written on the package, which \\n\\nbore a diplomatic seal. \"For me, Messer?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, a personal token from the Holy Father. Better not \\n\\nopen it here. Now, can I do anything for you before you \\n\\nleave New Rome? I\\'d be glad to show you anything you\\'ve \\n\\nmissed.\" \\n\\nBrother Francis thought briefly. There had already been an \\n\\nexhaustive tour. \"I would like to see the basilica just once \\n\\nagain, Messer,\" he said at last. \\n\\n\"Why, of course. But is that all?\" \\n\\nBrother Francis paused again. They had fallen behind the \\n\\nother departing pilgrims. \"I would like to confess,\" he \\n\\nadded softly. \\n\\n\"Nothing easier than that,\" said Aguerra, adding with a \\n\\ncan get anything absolved that you\\'re worried about. Is it \\n\\nsomething deadly enough to require the attention of the \\n\\nPope?\" \\n\\nFrancis reddened and shook his head.  \\n\\nabsolve you if you\\'re repentant, he\\'ll even hit you over the \\n\\nhead with a rod in the bargain.\" \\n\\n\"I meant– I was asking you, Messer,\" the monk \\n\\nstammered. \\n\\n\"Me? Why me? I\\'m nobody fancy. Here you are in a whole \\n\\ntown full of red hats, and you want to confess to Malfreddo \\n\\nAguerra.\" \\n\\n\"Because– because you were our Patron\\'s advocate,\" the \\n\\nmonk explained. \\n\\n\"Oh, I see. Why of course I\\'ll hear your confession. But I \\n\\ncan\\'t absolve you in the name of your Patron, you know. \\n\\nIt\\'ll have to be the Holy Trinity as usual. Will that do?\" \\n\\nFrancis had little to confess, but his heart had long been \\n\\ntroubled– at the prompting of Dom Arkos– by the fear that \\n\\nhis discovery of the shelter might have hindered the case \\n\\nhim, and absolved him in the basilica, then led him around \\n\\nthat ancient church. During the ceremony of canonization \\n\\nand the Mass that followed, Brother Francis had noticed \\n\\nonly the majestic splendor of the building. Now the aged \\n\\nmonsignor pointed to crumbling masonry, places in need of \\n\\nrepair, and the shameful condition of some of the older \\n\\nfrescoes. Again he caught a glimpse of a poverty which \\n\\ndignity veiled. The Church was not wealthy in this age. \\n\\ncontained a purse. In the purse were two heklos of gold. \\n\\nHe glanced at Malfreddo Aguerra. The monsignor smiled. \\n\\n\"You did say that the robber won the commemoration from \\n\\nyou in a wrestling match, didn\\'t you?\" Aguerra asked. \\n\\n\"Yes, Messer.\" \\n\\n\"Well then, even if you were forced into it, you made the \\n\\nchoice to wrestle him for it yourself, didn\\'t you? You \\n\\naccepted his challenge?\" \\n\\nThe monk nodded. \\n\\n\"Then I don\\'t think you\\'d be condoning the wrong if you \\n\\nbought it back.\" He clapped the monk\\'s shoulder and \\n\\nblessed him. Then it was time to go. \\n\\nThe small keeper of the flame of knowledge trudged back \\n\\ntoward his abbey on foot. There were days and weeks on \\n\\nthe trail, but his heart was singing as he approached the \\n\\nrobber\\'s outpost. Do with it what you will, Pope Leo had \\n\\nsaid of the gold. Not only that, the monk had now, in \\n\\naddition to the purse, an answer to the robber\\'s scornful \\n\\nquestion. He thought of the books in the audience room, \\n\\nwaiting there for a reawakening. \\n\\nThe robber, however, was not waiting at his outpost as \\n\\nFrancis had hoped. There were recent footprints in the trail \\n\\nat that place, but the prints led cross-trail and there was \\n\\nno sign of the robber. The sun filtered through the trees to \\n\\ncover the ground with leafy shadows. The forest was not \\n\\ndense, but it offered shade. He sat down beside the trail to \\n\\nwait. \\n\\nAn owl hooted at midday from the relative darkness in the \\n\\ndepths of some distant arroyo. Buzzards circled in a patch \\n\\nof blue beyond the treetops. It seemed peaceful in the \\n\\nforest that day. As he listened sleepily to the sparrows \\n\\nfluttering in nearby brush, he found himself not greatly \\n\\nconcerned about whether the robber came today or \\n\\ntomorrow. So long was his journey, that he would not be \\n\\nunhappy to enjoy a day of rest while waiting. He sat \\n\\nwatching the buzzards. Occasionally he glanced down the \\n\\ntrail that led toward his distant home in the desert. The \\n\\nrobber had chosen an excellent location for his lair. From \\n\\nthis place, one could observe more than a mile of trail in \\n\\nof forest. \\n\\nSomething moved on the trail in the distance. \\n\\nBrother Francis shielded his eyes and studied the distant \\n\\nmovement. There was a sunny area down the road where \\n\\na brush fire had cleared several acres of land around the \\n\\ntrail that led southwest. The trail shimmered under a \\n\\nmirror of heat in the sunswept region. He could not see \\n\\nclearly because of the shiny reflections, but there was \\n\\nmotion in the midst of the heat. There was a wriggling \\n\\nblack iota. At times it seemed to wear a head. At times it \\n\\nwas completely obscured in the heat glaze, but \\n\\nnevertheless he could determine that it was gradually \\n\\napproaching. Once, when the edge of a cloud brushed at \\n\\nthe sun, the heat shimmer subsided for a few seconds; his \\n\\ntired and myopic eyes determined then that the wriggling \\n\\niota was really a man, but at too great a distance for \\n\\nrecognition. He shivered. Something about the iota was \\n\\ntoo familiar. \\n\\nBut no, it couldn\\'t possibly be the same. \\n\\nThe monk crossed himself and began telling his rosary \\n\\nin the heat shimmer. \\n\\nWhile he had been waiting there for the robber, a debate \\n\\nhad been in progress, higher on the side of the hill. The \\n\\ndebate had been conducted in whispered monosyllables, \\n\\nand had lasted for nearly an hour. Now the debate was \\n\\nended. Two-Hoods had conceded to One-Hood. Together, \\n\\nthe Pope\\'s children stole quietly from behind their brush \\n\\ntable and crept down the side of the hill. \\n\\nThey advanced to within ten yards of Francis before a \\n\\npebble rattled. The monk was murmuring the third Ave of \\n\\nthe Fourth Glorious Mystery of the rosary when he \\n\\nhappened to look around. \\n\\nThe arrow hit him squarely between the eyes. \\n\\n\"Eat! Eat! Eat!\" the Pope\\'s child cried.  \\n\\nOn the trail to the southwest the old wanderer sat down on \\n\\na log and closed his eyes to rest them against the sun. He \\n\\nfanned himself with a tattered basket hat and munched his \\n\\nspice-leaf quid. He had been wandering for a long time. \\n\\nThe search seemed endless, but there was always the \\n\\npromise of finding what he sought across the next rise or \\n\\nhimself, he clapped the hat back on his head and scratched \\n\\nat his brushy beard while blinking around at the landscape. \\n\\nThere was a patch of unburned forest on the hillside just \\n\\nahead. It offered welcome shade, but still the wanderer sat \\n\\nthere in the sunlight and watched the curious buzzards. \\n\\nThey had congregated, and they were swooping rather low \\n\\nover the wooded patch. One bird made bold to descend \\n\\namong the trees, but it quickly flapped into view again, \\n\\nflew under power until it found a rising column of air, then \\n\\nwent into gliding ascent. The dark host of scavengers \\n\\nseemed to be expending more than a usual amount of \\n\\nenergy at flapping their wings. Usually they soared, \\n\\nconserving strength. Now they thrashed the air above the \\n\\nhillside as if impatient to land. \\n\\nAs long as the buzzards remained interested but reluctant, \\n\\nthe wanderer remained the same. There were cougars in \\n\\nthese hills. Beyond the peak were things even worse than \\n\\ncougars, and sometimes they prowled afar. \\n\\nThe wanderer waited. Finally the buzzards descended \\n\\namong the trees. The wanderer waited five minutes more. \\n\\nAt last he arose and limped ahead toward the forested \\n\\npatch, dividing his weight between his game leg and his \\n\\nstaff. \\n\\nAfter a while he entered the forested area. The buzzards \\n\\nwere busy at the remains of a man. The wanderer chased \\n\\nthe birds away with his cudgel and inspected the human \\n\\nremnants. Significant portions were missing. There was an \\n\\narrow through the skull, protruding at the back of the \\n\\nneck. The old man looked nervously around at the brush. \\n\\nThere was no one in sight, but there were plenty of \\n\\nfootprints in the vicinity of the trail. It was not safe to stay. \\n\\nSafe or not, the job had to be done. The old wanderer \\n\\nfound a place where the earth was soft enough for digging \\n\\nwith hands and stick. While he dug, the angry buzzards \\n\\ncircled low over the treetops. Sometimes darting \\n\\nearthward but then flapping their way skyward again. For \\n\\nan hour, then two, they fluttered anxiously over the \\n\\nwooded hillside. \\n\\nOne bird finally landed. It strutted indignantly about a \\n\\nmound of fresh earth with a rock marker at one end. \\n\\nDisappointed, it took wing again. The flock of dark \\n\\nscavengers abandoned the site and soared high on the \\n\\nrising currents ot air while they hungrily watched the land. \\n\\nThere was a dead hog beyond the Valley of the Misborn. \\n\\nThe buzzards observed it gaily and glided down for a feast. \\n\\nLater, in a far mountain pass, a cougar licked her chops \\n\\nand left her kill. The buzzards seemed thankful for the \\n\\nchance to finish her meal. \\n\\nThe buzzards laid their eggs in season and lovingly fed \\n\\ntheir young: a dead snake, and bits of a feral dog. \\n\\nThe younger generation waxed strong, soared high and far \\n\\non black wings, waiting for the fruitful Earth to yield up her \\n\\nbountiful carrion. Sometimes dinner was only a toad. Once \\n\\nit was a messenger from New Rome. \\n\\nTheir flight carried them over the midwestern plains. They \\n\\nwere delighted with the bounty of good things which the \\n\\nnomads left lying on the land during their ride-over toward \\n\\nthe south. \\n\\nThe buzzards laid their eggs in season and lovingly fed \\n\\ntheir young. Earth had nourished them bountifully for \\n\\ncenturies. She would nourish them for centuries more. . . \\n\\nPickings were good for a while in the region of the Red \\n\\nRiver; but then out of the carnage, a city-state arose. For \\n\\nrising city-states, the buzzards had no fondness, although \\n\\nthey approved of their eventual fall. They shied away from \\n\\nTexarkana and ranged far over the plain to the west. After \\n\\nthe manner of all living things, they replenished the Earth \\n\\nmany times with their kind. \\n\\nEventually it was the Year of Our Lord 3174. \\n\\nThere were rumors of war. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nPart II Fiat Lux \\n\\nChapter Twelve \\n\\nMarcus Apollo became certain of war\\'s imminence the \\n\\nmoment he overheard Hannegan\\'s third wife tell a serving \\n\\nmaid that her favorite courtier had returned with his skin \\n\\nintact from a mission to the tents of Mad Bear\\'s clan. The \\n\\nfact that he had come back alive from the nomad \\n\\nencampment meant that a war was brewing. Purportedly, \\n\\nthe emissary\\'s mission had been to tell the Plains tribes \\n\\nthat the civilized states had entered into the Agreement of \\n\\nthe Holy Scourge concerning the disputed lands, and would \\n\\nhereafter wreak stern vengeance on the nomadic peoples \\n\\nand bandit groups for any further raiding activities. But no \\n\\nman carried such news to Mad Bear and came back alive. \\n\\nTherefore, Apollo concluded, the ultimatum had not been \\n\\ndelivered, and Hannegan\\'s emissary had gone out to the \\n\\nPlains with an ulterior purpose. And the purpose was all \\n\\ntoo clear. \\n\\nApollo picked his way politely through the small throng of \\n\\nguests, his sharp eyes searching out Brother Claret and \\n\\ntrying to attract his glance. Apollo\\'s tall figure in severe \\n\\nblack cassock with a small flash of color at the waist to  \\n\\ndenote his rank stood out sharply in contrast to the \\n\\nhall, and he was not long in catching his clerk\\'s eye and \\n\\nnodding him toward the table of refreshments which was \\n\\nnow reduced to a litter of scraps, greasy cups, and a few \\n\\nroast squabs that looked overcooked. Apollo dragged at \\n\\nthe dregs of the punch bowl with the ladle, observed a \\n\\ndead roach floating among the spices, and thoughtfully \\n\\nhanded the first cup to Brother Claret as the clerk \\n\\napproached. \\n\\n\"Thank you, Messer,\" said Claret, not noticing the roach. \\n\\n\"You wanted to see me?\" \\n\\n\"As soon as the reception\\'s over. In my quarters. Sarkal \\n\\ncame back alive.\" \\n\\n\"Oh.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ve never heard a more ominous \\'oh.\\' I take it you \\n\\nunderstand the interesting implications?\" \\n\\n\"Certainly, Messer. It means the Agreement was a fraud \\n\\non Hannegan\\'s part, and he intends to use it against– \" \\n\\naudience, and the clerk turned to refill his cup from the \\n\\npunch bowl. His interest became suddenly absorbed there, \\n\\nand he did not look at the lean figure in watered-silk who \\n\\nstrode toward them from the entrance. Apollo smiled \\n\\nformally and bowed to the man. Their hand-clasp was brief \\n\\nand noticeably chilly. \\n\\n\"Well, Thon Taddeo,\" said the priest, \"your presence \\n\\nsurprises me. I thought you shunned such festive \\n\\nattract such a distinguished scholar?\" He lifted his brows in \\n\\nmock perplexity. \\n\\n\"You\\'re the attraction, of course,\" said the newcomer, \\n\\nmatching Apollo\\'s sarcasm, \"and my only reason for \\n\\nattending.\" \\n\\n\"I?\" He feigned surprise, but the assertion was probably \\n\\ntrue. The wedding reception of a half-sister was not the \\n\\nsort of thing that would impel Thon Taddeo to bedeck \\n\\nhimself in formal finery and leave the cloistered halls of the \\n\\ncollegium. \\n\\n\"As a matter of fact, I\\'ve been looking for you all day. They  \\n\\ntold me you\\'d be here. Otherwise– \" He looked around the  \\n\\nbanquet hail and snorted irritably. \\n\\nThe snort cut whatever thread of fascination was tying \\n\\nBrother Claret\\'s gaze to the punch bowl, and he turned to \\n\\nbow to the thon. \"Care for punch, Thon Taddeo?\" he \\n\\nasked, offering a full cup. \\n\\nThe scholar accepted it with a nod and drained it. \"I \\n\\nwanted to ask you a little more about the Leibowitzian \\n\\ndocuments we discussed,\" he said to Marcus Apollo. \"I had \\n\\nassured me they have writings that date back to the last \\n\\nyears of the European-American civilization.\" \\n\\nIf the fact that he himself had assured the scholar of the \\n\\nsame thing several months ago was irritating to Apollo, his \\n\\nexpression gave no hint of it. \"Yes,\" he said. \"They\\'re quite \\n\\nauthentic, I\\'m told.\" \\n\\n\"If so, it strikes me as very mysterious that nobody\\'s \\n\\nheard– but never mind that. Kornhoer listed a number of \\n\\ndocuments and texts they claim to have and described \\n\\nthem. If they exist at all, I\\'ve got to see them.\" \\n\\n\"Oh?\"  \\n\\n\"Yes. If it\\'s a hoax, it should be found out, and if it isn\\'t, \\n\\nthe data might well be priceless.\" \\n\\nThe monsignor frowned. \"I assure you there is no hoax,\" \\n\\nhe said stiffly. \\n\\n\"The letter contained an invitation to visit the abbey and \\n\\nstudy the documents. They\\'ve evidently heard of me.\" \\n\\n\"Not necessarily,\" said Apollo, unable to resist the \\n\\nopportunity. \"They aren\\'t particular about who reads their \\n\\nbooks, as long as he washes his hands and doesn\\'t deface \\n\\ntheir property.\" \\n\\nThe scholar glowered. The suggestion that there might \\n\\nexist literate persons who had never heard his name did \\n\\nnot please him. \\n\\n\"But there, then!\" Apollo went on affably. \"You have no \\n\\nproblem. Accept their invitation, go to the abbey, study \\n\\ntheir relics. They\\'ll make you welcome.\" \\n\\nThe scholar huffed irritably at the suggestion. \"And travel  \\n\\nthrough the Plains at a time when Mad Bear\\'s clan is– \" \\n\\nThon Taddeo broke off abruptly. \\n\\n\"You were saying?\" Apollo prompted, his face showing no \\n\\nspecial alertness, although a vein in his temple began to \\n\\nthrob as he stared expectantly at Thon Taddeo. \\n\\n\"Only that it\\'s a long dangerous trip, and I can\\'t spare six \\n\\nmonths\\' absence from the collegium. I wanted to discuss \\n\\nthe possibility of sending a well-armed party of the Mayor\\'s \\n\\nguardsmen to fetch the documents here for study.\" \\n\\nApollo choked. He felt a childish impulse to kick the scholar \\n\\nin the shins. \"I\\'m afraid,\" he said politely, \"that would be \\n\\nquite impossible. But in any case, the matter is outside my \\n\\nsphere, and I\\'m afraid I can\\'t be of any help to you.\" \\n\\n\"Why not?\" Thou Taddeo demanded. \"Aren\\'t you the \\n\\nVatican\\'s nuncio to the Court of Hannegan?\" \\n\\n\"Precisely. I represent New Rome, not the monastic \\n\\nOrders. The government of an abbey is in the hands of its \\n\\nabbot.\" \\n\\n\"But with a little pressure from New Rome. . .\"  \\n\\nThe impulse to kick shins surged swiftly. \"We\\'d better \\n\\ndiscuss it later,\" Monsignor Apollo said curtly. \"This \\n\\nevening in my study, if you like.\" He half turned, and \\n\\nlooked back inquiringly as if to say Well? \\n\\n\"I\\'ll be there,\" the scholar said sharply, and marched away. \\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t you tell him flatly no, then and there?\" Claret \\n\\nfumed when they were alone in the embassy suite an hour \\n\\nlater. \"Transport priceless relics through bandit country in \\n\\nthese times? It\\'s unthinkable, Messer.\" \\n\\n\"Certainly.\" \\n\\n\"Then why– \" \\n\\n\"Two reasons. First, Thon Taddeo is Hannegan\\'s kinsman, \\n\\nand influential too. We have to be courteous to Caesar and \\n\\nhis kin whether we like him or not. Second, he started to \\n\\nsay something about the Mad Bear clan, and then broke \\n\\noff. I think he knows what\\'s going to happen. I\\'m not going \\n\\nto engage in espionage, but if he volunteers any \\n\\ninformation, there\\'s nothing to prevent our including it in \\n\\nthe report you\\'re about to deliver personally to New \\n\\nRome.\" \\n\\n\"I!\" The clerk looked shocked. \"To New Rome– ? But what– \\n\\n\" \\n\\n\"Not so loud,\" said the nuncio, glancing at the door. \"I\\'m \\n\\ngoing to have to send my estimate of this situation to His \\n\\nHoliness, and quickly. But it\\'s the kind of thing that one \\n\\ndoesn\\'t dare put in writing. If Hannegan\\'s people \\n\\nintercepted such a dispatch, you and I would probably be \\n\\nfound floating face down in the Red River. If Hannegan\\'s \\n\\nenemies get hold of it, Hannegan would probably feel \\n\\njustified in hanging us publicly as spies. Martyrdom is all \\n\\nvery well, but we have a job to do first.\" \\n\\n\"And I\\'m to deliver the report orally at the Vatican?\" \\n\\nBrother Claret muttered, apparently not relishing the \\n\\nprospect of crossing hostile country. \\n\\n\"It has to be that way. Thon Taddeo may, just possibly \\n\\nmay, give us an excuse for your leaving abruptly for Saint \\n\\nLeibowitz abbey, or New Rome, or both. In case there are \\n\\nany suspicions around the Court. I\\'ll try to steer it.\" \\n\\n\"And the substance of the report I\\'m to deliver, Messer?\" \\n\\n\"That Hannegan\\'s ambition to unite the continent under  \\n\\none dynasty isn\\'t so wild a dream as we thought. That the \\n\\nAgreement of the Holy Scourge is probably a fraud by \\n\\nHannegan, and that he means to use it to get both the \\n\\nPlains nomads. If Laredan forces are tied up in a running \\n\\nbattle with Mad Bear, it wouldn\\'t take much \\n\\nencouragement for the State of Chihuahua to attack \\n\\nLaredo from the south. After all, there\\'s an old enmity \\n\\nthere. Hannegan, of course, can then march victoriously to \\n\\nRio Laredo. With Laredo under his thumb, he can look \\n\\nforward to tackling both Denver and the Mississippi \\n\\nRepublic without worrying about a stab in the back from \\n\\nthe south.\" \\n\\n\"Do you think Hannegan can do it, Messer?\" \\n\\nMarcus Apollo started to answer, then closed his mouth \\n\\nslowly. He walked to the window and stared out at the \\n\\nsunlit city, a sprawling disorderly city built mostly of rubble \\n\\nfrom another age. A city without orderly patterns of \\n\\nstreets. It had grown slowly over an ancient ruin, as \\n\\nperhaps someday another city would grow over the ruin of \\n\\nthis one. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" he answered softly. \"In these times, it\\'s  \\n\\nhard to condemn any man for wanting to unite this \\n\\nbutchered continent. Even by such means as– but no, I \\n\\ndon\\'t mean that.\" He sighed heavily. \"In any case, our \\n\\ninterests are not the interests of politics. We must \\n\\nforewarn New Rome of what may be coming, because the \\n\\nChurch will be affected by it, whatever happens. And \\n\\nforewarned, we may be able to keep out of the squabble.\" \\n\\n\"You really think so?\" \\n\\n\"Of course not!\" the priest said gently. \\n\\nThon Taddeo Pfardentrott arrived at Marcus Apollo\\'s study \\n\\nas early in the day as could be construed as evening, and \\n\\nhis manner had noticeably changed since the reception. He \\n\\nmanaged a cordial smile, and there was nervous eagerness \\n\\nin the way he spoke. This fellow, thought Marcus, is after \\n\\nsomething he wants rather badly, and he\\'s even willing to \\n\\nbe polite in order to get it. Perhaps the list of ancient \\n\\nwritings supplied by the monks at the Leibowitzian abbey \\n\\nhad impressed the thon more than he wanted to admit. \\n\\nThe nuncio had been prepared for a fencing match, but the \\n\\nscholar\\'s evident excitement made him too easy a victim, \\n\\nand Apollo relaxed his readiness for verbal dueling.  \\n\\n\"This afternoon there was a meeting of the faculty of the \\n\\ncollegium,\" said Thou Taddeo as soon as they were seated. \\n\\n\"We talked about Brother Kornhoer\\'s letter, and the list of \\n\\ndocuments.\" He paused as if uncertain of an approach. The \\n\\ngray dusklight from the large arched window on his left \\n\\nmade his face seem blanched and intense, and his wide \\n\\ngray eyes searched at the priest as if measuring him and \\n\\nmaking estimates. \\n\\n\"I take it there was skepticism?\" \\n\\nThe gray eyes fell momentarily, and lifted quickly. \"Shall I \\n\\nbe polite?\" \\n\\n\"Don\\'t bother,\" Apollo chuckled. \\n\\n\"There was skepticism. \\'Incredulity\\' is more nearly the \\n\\nword. My own feeling is that if such papers exist, they are \\n\\nprobably forgeries dating back several centuries. I doubt if \\n\\nthe present monks at the abbey are trying to perpetrate a \\n\\nhoax. Naturally, they would believe the documents valid.\" \\n\\n\"Kind of you to absolve them,\" Apollo said sourly. \\n\\n\"I offered to be polite. Shall I?\"  \\n\\n\"No. Go on.\" \\n\\nThe thon slid out of his chair and went to sit in the window. \\n\\nHe gazed at the fading yellow patches of cloud in the west \\n\\nand pounded softly on the sill while he spoke. \"The papers. \\n\\nNo matter what we may believe of them, the idea that \\n\\nsuch documents may still exist intact– that there\\'s even a \\n\\nslightest chance of their existing– is, well, so arousing a \\n\\nthought that we must investigate them immediately.\" \\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Apollo, a little amused. \"They invited you. \\n\\nBut tell me: what do you find so arousing about the \\n\\ndocuments?\" \\n\\nThe scholar shot him a quick glance. \"Are you acquainted \\n\\nwith my work?\" \\n\\nThe monsignor hesitated. He was acquainted with it, but \\n\\nadmitting the acquaintance might force him to admit to an \\n\\nawareness that Thon Taddeo\\'s name was being spoken in \\n\\nthe same breath with names of natural philosophers dead \\n\\na thousand years and more, while the thon was scarcely in \\n\\nhis thirties. The priest was not eager to admit knowing that \\n\\nthis young scientist showed promise of becoming one of \\n\\nthose rare outcroppings of human genius that appear only \\n\\na time or two every century to revolutionize an entire field \\n\\nof thought in one vast sweep. He coughed apologetically. \\n\\n\"I must admit that I haven\\'t read a good deal of– \" \\n\\nit is highly abstract, and tedious to the layman. Theories of \\n\\nelectrical essence. Planetary motion. Attracting bodies. \\n\\nMatters of that sort. Now Kornhoer\\'s list mentions such \\n\\nnames as Laplace, Maxwell, and Einstein– do they mean \\n\\nanything to you?\" \\n\\n\"Not much. History mentions them as natural philosophers, \\n\\ndoesn\\'t it? From before the collapse of the last civilization? \\n\\nAnd I think they\\'re named in one of the pagan hagiologies, \\n\\naren\\'t they?\" \\n\\nThe scholar nodded. \"And that\\'s all anyone knows about \\n\\nthem, or what they did. Physicists, according to our \\n\\nnot-so-reliable historians. Responsible for the rapid rise of \\n\\nthe European-American culture, they say. Historians list \\n\\nnothing but trivia. I had nearly forgotten them. But \\n\\nKornhoer\\'s descriptions of the old documents they say they \\n\\nhave are descriptions of papers that might well be taken \\n\\nfrom physical science texts of some kind. It\\'s just \\n\\nimpossible!\" \\n\\n\"But you have to make certain?\" \\n\\nhad never heard of it.\" \\n\\n\"Why?\" \\n\\nThon Taddeo was peering at something in the street \\n\\nbelow. He beckoned to the priest. \"Come here a moment. \\n\\nI\\'ll show you why.\" \\n\\nApollo slipped from behind the desk and looked down at \\n\\nthe muddy rutted street beyond the wall that encircled the \\n\\npalace and barracks and buildings of the collegium, cutting \\n\\noff the mayoral sanctuary from the seething plebeian city. \\n\\nThe scholar was pointing at the shadowy figure of a \\n\\npeasant leading a donkey homeward at twilight. The man\\'s \\n\\nfeet were wrapped in sackcloth, and the mud had caked \\n\\nabout them so that he seemed scarcely able to lift them. \\n\\nBut he trudged ahead in one slogging step after another, \\n\\nresting half a second between footfalls. He seemed too \\n\\nweary to scrape off the mud.  \\n\\n\"He doesn\\'t ride the donkey,\" Thon Taddeo stated, \\n\\n\"because this morning the donkey was loaded down with \\n\\ncorn. It doesn\\'t occur to him that the packs are empty \\n\\nnow. What is good enough for the morning is also good \\n\\nenough for the afternoon.\" \\n\\n\"You know him?\" \\n\\n\"He passes under my window too. Every morning and \\n\\nevening. Hadn\\'t you noticed him?\" \\n\\n\"A thousand like him.\" \\n\\n\"Look. Can you bring yourself to believe that that brute is \\n\\nthe lineal descendent of men who supposedly invented \\n\\nmachines that flew, who traveled to the moon, harnessed \\n\\nthe forces of Nature, built machines that could talk and \\n\\nseemed to think? Can you believe there were such men?\" \\n\\nApollo was silent. \\n\\n\"Look at him!\" the scholar persisted. \"No, but it\\'s too dark \\n\\nnow. You can\\'t see the syphilis outbreak on his neck, the \\n\\nway the bridge of his nose is being eaten away. Paresis. \\n\\nBut he was undoubtedly a moron to begin with. Illiterate, \\n\\nsuperstitious, murderous. He diseases his children. For a \\n\\nfew coins he would kill them. He will sell them anyway, \\n\\nwhen they are old enough to be useful. Look at him, and \\n\\ntell me if you see the progeny of a once-mighty \\n\\ncivilization? What do you see?\" \\n\\n\"The image of Christ,\" grated the monsignor, surprised at \\n\\nhis own sudden anger. \"What did you expect me to see?\" \\n\\nThe scholar huffed impatiently. \"The incongruity. Men as \\n\\nyou can observe them through any window, and men as \\n\\nhistorians would have us believe men once were. I can\\'t \\n\\naccept it. How can a great and wise civilization have \\n\\ndestroyed itself so completely?\" \\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Apollo, \"by being materially great and \\n\\nmaterially wise, and nothing else.\" He went to light a \\n\\ntallow lamp, for the twilight was rapidly fading into night. \\n\\nHe struck steel and flint until the spark caught and he blew \\n\\ngently at it in the tinder. \\n\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Thon Taddeo, \"but I doubt it.\" \\n\\n\"You reject all history, then, as myth?\" A flame edged out  \\n\\nfrom the spark. \\n\\n\"Not \\'reject.\\' But it must be questioned. Who wrote your \\n\\nhistories?\" \\n\\n\"The monastic Orders, of course. During the darkest \\n\\ncenturies, there was no one else to record them.\" He \\n\\ntransferred flame to wick. \\n\\n\"There! You have it. And during the time of the antipopes, \\n\\nhow many schismatic Orders were fabricating their own \\n\\nversions of things, and passing off their versions as the \\n\\nwork of earlier men? You can\\'t know, you can\\'t really \\n\\nknow. That there was on this continent a more advanced \\n\\ncivilization than we have now– that can\\'t be denied. You \\n\\ncan look at the rubble and the rotted metal and know it. \\n\\nYou can dig under a strip of\\' blown sand and find their \\n\\nbroken roadways. But where is there evidence of the kind \\n\\nof machines your historians tell us they had in those days? \\n\\nWhere are the remains of self-moving carts, of flying \\n\\nmachines?\" \\n\\n\"Beaten into plowshares and hoes.\" \\n\\n\"If they existed.\" \\n\\n\"If you doubt it, why bother studying the Leibowitzian \\n\\ndocuments?\" \\n\\n\"Because a doubt is not a denial. Doubt is a powerful tool, \\n\\nand it should be applied to history.\" \\n\\nThe nuncio smiled tightly. \"And what do you want me to do \\n\\nabout it, learned Thon?\" \\n\\nThe scholar leaned forward earnestly. \"Write to the abbot \\n\\nof this place. Assure him that the documents will be \\n\\ntreated with utmost care, and will be returned after we \\n\\nhave completely examined them for authenticity and \\n\\nstudied their content.\" \\n\\n\"Whose assurance do you want me to give him– yours or \\n\\nmine?\" \\n\\n\"Hannegan\\'s, yours, and mine.\" \\n\\n\"I can give him only yours and Hannegan\\'s. I have no \\n\\ntroops of my own.\" \\n\\nThe scholar reddened.  \\n\\n\"Tell me,\" the nuncio added hastily, \"why– besides \\n\\nbandits– do you insist you must see them here, instead of \\n\\ngoing to the abbey?\" \\n\\n\"The best reason you can give the abbot is that if the \\n\\ndocuments are authentic, if we have to examine them at \\n\\nthe abbey, a confirmation wouldn\\'t mean much to other \\n\\nsecular scholars.\" \\n\\n\"You mean your colleagues might think the monks had \\n\\ntricked you into something?\" \\n\\n\"Ummm, that might be inferred. But also important, if \\n\\nthey\\'re brought here, they can be examined by everyone \\n\\nin the collegium who\\'s qualified to form an opinion. And \\n\\nsouthwest desert for six months.\" \\n\\n\"I see your point.\" \\n\\n\"Will you send the request to the abbey?\" \\n\\n\"Yes.\"  \\n\\nThou Taddeo appeared surprised. \\n\\n\"But it will be your request, not mine. And it\\'s only fair to \\n\\ntell you that I don\\'t think Dom Paulo, the abbot, will say \\n\\nyes.\" \\n\\nThe thon, however, appeared to be satisfied. When he had \\n\\ngone, the nuncio summoned his clerk. \\n\\n\"You\\'ll be leaving for New Rome tomorrow,\" he told him. \\n\\n\"By way of Leibowitz Abbey?\" \\n\\n\"Come back by way of it. The report to New Rome is \\n\\nurgent.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, Messer.\" \\n\\n\"At the abbey, tell Dom Paulo that Sheba expects Solomon \\n\\nto come to her. Bearing gifts. Then you better cover your \\n\\nears. When he finishes exploding, hurry back so I can tell \\n\\nThon Taddeo no.\" \\n\\nEnd of Chapter  \\n\\nChapter Thirteen  \\n\\nTime seeps slowly on the desert and there is little change \\n\\nto mark its passage. Two seasons had passed since Dom \\n\\nPaulo had refused the request from across the Plains, but \\n\\nthe matter had been settled only a few weeks ago. Or had \\n\\nit been settled at all? Texarkana was obviously unhappy \\n\\nwith the results. \\n\\nThe abbot paced along the abbey walls at sundown, his \\n\\njaw thrust ahead like a whiskery old crag against possible \\n\\nbreakers out of the sea of events. His thinning hair \\n\\nfluttered in white pennants on the desert wind, and the \\n\\nwind wrapped his habit bandage-tight about his stooped \\n\\nbody, making him look like an emaciated Ezekiel with a \\n\\nstrangely round little paunch. He thrust his gnarled hands \\n\\ninto his sleeves and glowered occasionally across the \\n\\ndesert toward the village of Sanly Bowitts in the distance. \\n\\nThe red sunlight threw his pacing shadow across the \\n\\ncourtyard, and the monks who encountered it in crossing \\n\\nthe grounds glanced up wonderingly at the old man. Their \\n\\nruler had seemed moody of late, and given to strange \\n\\nforebodings. It was whispered that the time soon was \\n\\ncoming when a new abbot would be appointed ruler over \\n\\nthe Brothers of Saint Leibowitz. It was whispered that the \\n\\nold man was not well, not well at all. It was whispered that  \\n\\nif the abbot heard the whispers, the whisperers should \\n\\npleased him for once not to take note of it. He well knew \\n\\nthat the whispers were true. \\n\\n\"Read it to me again,\" he said abruptly to the monk who \\n\\nstood motionless near at hand. \\n\\nThe monk\\'s hood jogged slightly in the abbot\\'s direction. \\n\\n\"Which one, Domne?\" he asked. \\n\\n\"You know which one.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\" The monk fumbled in one sleeve. It seemed \\n\\nweighted down with half a bushel of documents and \\n\\ncorrespondence, but after a moment he found the right \\n\\none. Affixed to the scroll was the label: \\n\\nSUB IMMUNITATE APOSTOLICA HOC SUPPOSITUM EST.\\n\\n QUISQUIS NUNTIUM MOLESTARE AUDEAT, \\n\\nIPSO FACTO EXCOMMUNICETUR.  \\n\\nDET: R\\'dissimo Domno Paulo de Pecos, AOL, Abbati\\n\\n (Monastery of the Leibowitzian Brethren,\\n\\n Environs of Sanly Bowitts Village\\n\\n Southwest Desert, Empire of Denver)\\n\\n Cul SALUTEM DICIT: Marcus Apollo\\n\\n Papatiae Apocrisarius Texarkanae \\n\\n\"All right, that\\'s the one. So read it,\" the abbot said \\n\\nimpatiently. \\n\\n\"Accedite ad eum . . .\" The monk crossed himself and \\n\\nmurmured the customary Blessing of Texts, said before \\n\\nreading or writing almost as punctiliously as the blessing at \\n\\nmeals. For the preservation of literacy and learning \\n\\nthroughout a black millennium had been the task of the \\n\\nBrothers of Leibowitz, and such small rituals helped keep \\n\\nthat task in focus.  \\n\\nHaving finished the blessing, he held the scroll high against \\n\\nthe sunset so that it became a transparency. \"Iterum \\n\\noportet apponere tibi crucem ferendam, amice. . .\" \\n\\nHis voice was faintly singsong as his eyes plucked the \\n\\nwords out of a forest of superfluous pen-flourishings. The \\n\\nabbot leaned against the parapet to listen while he \\n\\nwatched the buzzards circling over the mesa of Last \\n\\nResort. \\n\\n\"\\'Again it is necessary to set before you a cross to be \\n\\nborne, old friend and shepherd of myopic bookworms,\\'\" \\n\\ndroned the voice of the reader, \"\\'but perhaps the bearing \\n\\nof the cross will smack of triumph. It appears that Sheba is \\n\\ncoming to Solomon after all, though probably to denounce \\n\\nhim as a charlatan. \\n\\n\"\\'This is to notify you that Thon Taddeo Pfardentrott, \\n\\nD.N.Sc., Sage of Sages, Scholar of Scholars, Fair-Haired \\n\\nSon-out-of-Wedlock of a certain Prince, and God\\'s Gift to \\n\\nan \"Awakening Generation,\" has finally made up his mind \\n\\nto pay you a visit, having exhausted all hope of \\n\\ntransporting your Memorabilia to this fair realm. He will be \\n\\narriving about the Feast of the Assumption, if he manages \\n\\nto evade \"bandit\" groups along the way. He will bring his \\n\\nmisgivings and a small party of armed cavalry, courtesy of \\n\\nHannegan II, whose corpulent person is even now \\n\\nhovering over me as I write, grunting and scowling at \\n\\nthese lines, which His Supremacy commanded me to write, \\n\\nand in which His Supremacy expects me to acclaim his \\n\\ncousin, the thon, in the hope that you\\'ll honor him fittingly. \\n\\ngout, I shall be no less than candid here: \\n\\n\"\\'So first, let me caution you about this person, Thon \\n\\nTaddeo. Treat him with your customary charity, but trust \\n\\nhim not. He is a brilliant scholar, but a secular scholar, and \\n\\na political captive of the State. Here, Hannegan is the \\n\\nState. Furthermore, the thon is rather anti-clerical, I \\n\\nthink– or perhaps solely anti-monastic. After his \\n\\nembarrassing birth, he was spirited away to a Benedictine \\n\\nmonastery, and– but no, ask the courier about that. . .\\'\" \\n\\nThe monk glanced up from his reading. The abbot was still  \\n\\nwatching the buzzards over Last Resort.  \\n\\n\"You\\'ve heard about his childhood, Brother?\" Dom Paulo \\n\\nasked. \\n\\nThe monk nodded. \\n\\n\"Read on.\" \\n\\nThe reading continued, but the abbot ceased to listen. He \\n\\nknew the letter nearly by heart, but still he felt that there \\n\\nwas something Marcus Apollo had been trying to say \\n\\nbetween the lines that he, Dom Paulo, had not yet \\n\\nmanaged to understand. Marcus was trying to warn him– \\n\\nbut of what? The tone of the letter was mildly flippant, but \\n\\nit seemed full of ominous incongruities which might have \\n\\nbeen designed to add up to some single dark congruity, if \\n\\nonly he could add them right. What danger could there be \\n\\nin letting the secular scholar study at the abbey? \\n\\nThon Taddeo himself, according to the courier who had \\n\\nbrought the letter, had been educated in the Benedictine \\n\\nmonastery where he had been taken as a child to avoid \\n\\nembarrassment to his father\\'s wife. The thon\\'s father was \\n\\nHannegan\\'s uncle, but his mother was a serving maid. The \\n\\nthe duke\\'s philandering until this common servant girl bore \\n\\nhim the son he had always wanted; then she cried unfair. \\n\\nShe had borne him only daughters, and to be bested by a \\n\\ncommoner aroused her wrath. She sent the child away, \\n\\nflogged and dismissed the servant, and renewed her grip \\n\\non the duke. She herself meant to have a manchild out of \\n\\nhim to reestablish her honor; she gave him three more \\n\\ngirls. The duke waited patiently for fifteen years; when she \\n\\ndied in miscarriage (of another girl), he promptly went to \\n\\nBut the young Taddeo of Hannegan-Pfardentrott had \\n\\nbecome a bitter child. He had grown from infancy to \\n\\nadolescence within sight of the city and the palace where \\n\\nhis first cousin was being prepared for the throne; if his \\n\\nfamily had entirely ignored him, however, he might have \\n\\nBut both his father and the servant girl whose womb had \\n\\nborne him came to visit him with just enough frequency to \\n\\nkeep him reminded that he was begotten of human flesh \\n\\nand not of stones, and thus to make him vaguely aware \\n\\nthat he was deprived of love to which he was entitled. And \\n\\nthen too, Prince Hannegan had come to the same \\n\\nmonastery for one year of schooling, had lorded it over his \\n\\nbastard cousin, and had excelled him in all things but \\n\\nkeenness of mind. The young Taddeo had hated the prince \\n\\nwith a quiet fury, and had set out to outdistance him as far \\n\\nas possible in learning at least. The race had proved a \\n\\nsham, however; the prince left the monastic school the \\n\\nfollowing year, as unlettered as he had come, nor was any \\n\\nfurther thought given to his education. Meanwhile, his \\n\\nexiled cousin continued the race alone and won high \\n\\nhonors; but his victory was hollow, for Hannegan did not \\n\\ncare. Thon Taddeo had come to despise the whole Court of \\n\\nTexarkana, but, with youthful inconsistency, he had \\n\\nreturned willingly to that Court to be legitimized as the \\n\\nfather\\'s son at last, appearing to forgive everyone except \\n\\nthe dead duchess who had exiled him and the monks who \\n\\nhad cared for him in that exile. \\n\\nPerhaps he thinks of our cloister as a place of durance vile, \\n\\nthought the abbot. There would be bitter memories, \\n\\nhalf-memories, and maybe a few imagined memories. \\n\\n\"\\'. . . seeds of controversy in the bed of the New Literacy,\\'\" \\n\\nthe reader continued. \"So take heed, and watch for the \\n\\nsymptoms. \\n\\n\"\\'But, on the other hand, not only His Supremacy, but the  \\n\\ndictates of charity and justice as well, insist that I  \\n\\nrecommend him to you as a well-meaning man, or at least \\n\\nas an unmalicious child, like most of these educated and \\n\\ngentlemanly pagans (and pagans they will make of \\n\\nthemselves, in spite of all). He will behave if you are firm, \\n\\nbut be careful, my friend. He has a mind like a loaded \\n\\nmusket, and it can go off in any direction. I trust, however, \\n\\nthat coping with him for a while will not be too taxing a \\n\\nproblem for your ingenuity and hospitality. \\n\\n\"\\'Quidam mihi calix nuper expletur, Paule. Precamini ergo \\n\\nDeum facere me fortiorem. Metuo ut hic pereat. Spero te \\n\\net fratres saepius oraturos esse pro tremescente Marco \\n\\nApolline. Valete in Christo, amici. \\n\\n\"\\'Texarkanae datum est Octava Ss Petri et Pauli, Anno \\n\\nDomini termillesimo. . .\\'\" \\n\\n\"Let\\'s see that seal again,\" said the abbot. \\n\\nThe monk handed him the scroll. Dom Paulo held it close \\n\\nto his face to peer at blurred lettering impressed at the \\n\\nbottom of the parchment by a badly inked wooden stamp: \\n\\n OKAYED BY HANNEGAN II, BY GRACE OF COD MAYOR, \\n\\n RULER OF TEXARKANA, DEFENDER OF TEE FAITH,\\n\\n AND VAQUERO SUPREME OF THE PLAINS. \\n\\nHIS MARK: X \\n\\n\"I wonder if His Supremacy had someone read the letter to \\n\\nhim later?\" worried the abbot. \\n\\n\"If so, m\\'Lord, would the letter have been sent?\" \\n\\n\"I suppose not. But frivolity under Hannegan\\'s nose just to \\n\\nspite the Mayor\\'s illiteracy is not like Marcus Apollo, unless \\n\\nhe was trying to tell me something between the lines– but \\n\\ncouldn\\'t quite think of a safe way to say it. That last part– \\n\\nabout a certain chalice that he\\'s afraid won\\'t pass away. \\n\\nlike Marcus; it isn\\'t like him at all.\" \\n\\nSeveral weeks had passed since the arrival of the letter; \\n\\nduring those weeks Dom Paulo had slept badly, had \\n\\nsuffered a recurrence of the old gastric trouble, had  \\n\\nbrooded overmuch on the past as if looking for something \\n\\nthat might have been done differently in order to avert the \\n\\nfuture. What future? he demanded of himself. There \\n\\nseemed no logical reason to expect trouble. The \\n\\ncontroversy between monks and villagers had all but died. \\n\\nnorth and east. Imperial Denver was not pressing its \\n\\nattempt to levy taxes upon monastic congregations. There \\n\\nwere no troops in the vicinity. The oasis was still furnishing \\n\\nwater. There seemed no current threat of plague among \\n\\nanimals or men. The corn was doing well this year in the \\n\\nirrigated fields. There were signs of progress in the world, \\n\\nand the village of Sanly Bowitts had achieved the fantastic \\n\\nliteracy rate of eight per cent– for which the villagers \\n\\nmight, but did not, thank the monks of the Leibowitzian \\n\\nOrder. \\n\\nAnd yet he felt forebodings. Some nameless threat lurked \\n\\njust around the corner of the world for the sun to rise \\n\\nagain. The feeling had been gnawing at him, as annoying \\n\\nas a swarm of hungry insects that buzzed about one\\'s face \\n\\nin the desert sun. There was the sense of the imminent, \\n\\nthe remorseless, the mindless; it coiled like a \\n\\nheat-maddened rattler, ready to strike at rolling \\n\\ntumbleweed.  \\n\\nthe abbot decided, but the devil was quite evasive. The \\n\\nabbot\\'s devil was rather small, as devils go: only \\n\\nknee-high, but he weighed ten tons and had the strength \\n\\nof five hundred oxen. He was not driven by maliciousness, \\n\\nas Dom Paulo imagined him, not nearly as much as he was \\n\\ndriven by frenzied compulsion, somewhat after the fashion \\n\\nof a rabid dog. He bit through meat and bone and nail \\n\\nsimply because he had damned himself, and damnation \\n\\ncreated a damnably insatiable appetite. And he was evil \\n\\nmerely because he had made a denial of Good, and the \\n\\ndenial had become a part of his essence, or a hole therein. \\n\\nSomewhere, Dom Paulo thought, he\\'s wading through a \\n\\nsea of men and leaving a wake of the maimed. \\n\\nWhat nonsense, old man! he chided himself. When you tire \\n\\nof living, change itself seems evil, does it not? for then any \\n\\nchange at all disturbs the deathlike peace of the life-weary. \\n\\nOh there\\'s the devil, all right, but let\\'s not credit him with \\n\\nmore than his damnable due. Are you that life-weary, old \\n\\nfossil? \\n\\nBut the foreboding lingered. \\n\\n\"Do you suppose the buzzards have eaten old Eleazar \\n\\nyet?\" asked a quiet voice at his elbow. \\n\\nDom Paulo glanced around with a start in the twilight. The \\n\\nvoice belonged to Father Gault, his prior and probable \\n\\nsuccessor. He stood fingering a rose and looking \\n\\n\"Eleazar? You mean Benjamin? Why, have you heard \\n\\nsomething about him lately?\" \\n\\n\"Well, no, Father Abbot.\" He laughed uneasily. \"But you \\n\\nseemed to be looking toward the mesa, and I thought you \\n\\nwere wondering about the Old Jew.\" He glanced toward the \\n\\nanvilshaped mountain, silhouetted against the gray patch \\n\\nof sky in the west. \"There\\'s a wisp of smoke up there, so I \\n\\nguess he\\'s still alive.\" \\n\\n\"We shouldn\\'t have to guess,\" Dom Paulo said abruptly. \\n\\n\"I\\'m going to ride over there and pay him a visit.\" \\n\\n\"You sound like you\\'re leaving tonight.\" Gault chuckled. \\n\\n\"In a day or two.\" \\n\\n\"Better be careful. They say he throws rocks at climbers.\"  \\n\\n\"And I\\'m ashamed that I haven\\'t. He\\'s lonely. I\\'ll go.\" \\n\\n\"If he\\'s lonely, why does he insist on living like a hermit?\" \\n\\n\"To escape loneliness– in a young world.\" \\n\\nThe young priest laughed. \"That perhaps makes his kind of \\n\\nsense, Domne, but I don\\'t quite see it.\" \\n\\n\"You will, when you\\'re my age, or his.\" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t expect to get that old. He lays claim to several \\n\\nthousand years.\" \\n\\nThe abbot smiled reminiscently. \"And you know, I can\\'t \\n\\nfifty-odd years ago, and I\\'d swear he looked just as old \\n\\nthen as he does now. He must be well over a hundred.\" \\n\\n\"Three thousand two hundred and nine, so he says. \\n\\nSometimes even older. I think he believes it, too. An \\n\\ninteresting madness.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m not so sure he\\'s mad, Father. Just devious in his \\n\\nsanity. What did you want to see me about?\" \\n\\n\"Three small matters. First, how do we get the Poet out of \\n\\nthe royal guest rooms– before Thon Taddeo arrives? He\\'s \\n\\ndue here in a few days, and the Poet\\'s taken root.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ll handle the Poet-sirrah. What else?\" \\n\\n\"Vespers. Will you be in the church?\" \\n\\n\"Not until Compline. You take over. What else?\" \\n\\n\"Controversy in the basement– over Brother Kornhoer\\'s \\n\\nexperiment.\" \\n\\n\"Who and how?\" \\n\\n\"Well, the silly gist of it seems to be that Brother \\n\\nArmbruster has the attitude of vespero mundi expectando, \\n\\nwhile with Brother Kornhoer, it\\'s the matins of the \\n\\nmillennium. Kornhoer moves something to make room for \\n\\na piece of equipment. Armbruster yells Perdition! Brother \\n\\nKornhoer yells Progress! and they have at each other \\n\\nagain. Then they come fuming to me to settle it. I scold \\n\\nthem for losing their tempers. They get sheepish and fawn \\n\\non each other for ten minutes. Six hours later, the floor \\n\\nshivers from Brother Armbruster\\'s bellowing Perdition! \\n\\ndown in the library. I can settle the blowups, but there \\n\\nseems to be a Basic Issue.\" \\n\\n\"A basic breach of conduct, I\\'d say. What do you want me \\n\\nto do about it? Exclude them from the table?\" \\n\\n\"Not yet, but you might warn them.\" \\n\\n\"All right, I\\'ll track it down. Is that all?\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s all, Domne.\" He started away, but paused. \"Oh, by \\n\\nthe way– do you think Brother Kornhoer\\'s contraption is \\n\\ngoing to work?\" \\n\\n\"I hope not!\" the abbot snorted. \\n\\nFather Gault appeared surprised. \"But, then why let him– \" \\n\\nmuch commotion by now, though, that I\\'m sorry I let him \\n\\nstart it.\" \\n\\n\"Then why not stop him?\"\\n\\n \"Because I\\'m hoping that he will reduce himself to \\n\\nabsurdity without any help from me. If the thing fails, it\\'ll \\n\\nfail just in time for Thon Taddeo\\'s arrival. That would be \\n\\njust the proper form of mortification for Brother Kornhoer– \\n\\nto remind him of his vocation, before he begins thinking \\n\\nthat he was called to Religion mainly for the purpose of \\n\\nbuilding a generator of electrical essences in the \\n\\nmonastery basement.\" \\n\\n\"But, Father Abbot, you\\'ll have to admit that it would be \\n\\nquite an achievement, if successful.\" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t have to admit it,\" Dom Paulo told him curtly. \\n\\nWhen Gault was gone, the abbot, after a brief debate with \\n\\nhimself, decided to handle the problem of the Poet-sirrah! \\n\\nbefore the problem of perdition-versus-progress. The \\n\\nsimplest solution to the problem of the Poet was for the \\n\\nPoet to get out of the royal suite, and preferably out of the \\n\\nabbey, out of the vicinity of the abbey, out of sight, \\n\\nhearing, and mind. But no one could expect a \"simplest \\n\\nsolution\" to get rid of the Poet-sirrah! \\n\\nThe abbot left the wall and crossed the courtyard toward \\n\\nthe guesthouse. He moved by feel, for the buildings were \\n\\nmonoliths of shadow under the stars, and only a few \\n\\nwindows glowed with candlelight. The windows of the royal \\n\\nsuite were dark; but the Poet kept odd hours and might \\n\\nwell be in. \\n\\nInside the building, he groped for the right door, found it, \\n\\nand knocked. There was no immediate answer, but only a \\n\\nfaint bleating sound which might or might not have issued \\n\\nfrom within the suite. He knocked again, then tried the \\n\\ndoor. It opened. \\n\\nFaint red light from a charcoal burner softened the \\n\\ndarkness; the room reeked of stale food. \\n\\n\"Poet?\" \\n\\nAgain the faint bleating, but closer now. He went to the \\n\\nburner, raked up an incandescent coal, and lit a splinter of \\n\\nthe room. It was empty. He transferred the flame to an oil \\n\\nlamp and went to explore the rest of the suite. It would \\n\\nhave to be thoroughly scrubbed and fumigated (also, \\n\\nperhaps, exorcised) before Thon Taddeo moved in. He \\n\\nhoped to make the Poet-sirrah! do the scrubbing, but knew  \\n\\nthe chance was remote. \\n\\nIn the second room, Dom Paulo suddenly felt as if \\n\\nsomeone were watching him. He paused and looked slowly \\n\\naround. \\n\\nA single eyeball peered at him from a vase of water on the \\n\\nshelf. The abbot nodded at it familiarly and went on. \\n\\nIn the third room, he met the goat. It was their first \\n\\nmeeting. \\n\\nThe goat was standing atop a tall cabinet, munching turnip \\n\\ngreens. It looked like a small breed of mountain goat, but \\n\\nit had a bald head that appeared bright blue by lamplight. \\n\\nUndoubtedly a freak by birth. \\n\\n\"Poet?\" he inquired, softly, looking straight at the goat and \\n\\ntouching his pectoral cross. \\n\\n\"In here,\" came a sleepy voice from the fourth room. \\n\\nDom Paulo sighed with relief. The goat went on munching \\n\\ngreens. Now that had been a hideous thought, indeed. \\n\\nThe Poet lay sprawled across the bed with a bottle of wine  \\n\\nwithin easy reach; he blinked irritably at the light with his \\n\\none good eye. \"I was asleep,\" he complained, adjusting his \\n\\nblack eyepatch and reaching for the bottle. \\n\\n\"Then wake up. You\\'re moving out of here immediately. \\n\\nTonight. Dump your possessions in the hall to let the suite \\n\\nair out. Sleep in the stable boy\\'s cell downstairs if you \\n\\nmust. Then come back in the morning and scrub this place \\n\\nout.\" \\n\\nThe Poet looked like a bruised lily for a moment, then \\n\\nmade a grab for something under the blankets. He brought \\n\\nout a fist and stared at it thoughtfully. \"Who used these \\n\\nquarters last?\" he asked. \\n\\n\"Monsignor Longi. Why?\" \\xad\\n\\n\"I wondered who brought the bedbugs.\" The Poet opened \\n\\nhis fist, pinched something out of his palm, cracked it \\n\\nbetween his nails, and flipped it away. \"Thon Taddeo can \\n\\nhave them. I don\\'t want them. I\\'ve been eaten up alive \\n\\nthat you\\'ve offered me my old cell back, I\\'ll be happy– \" \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t mean– \"  \\n\\n\"– to accept your kind hospitality a little longer. Only until  \\n\\nmy book is finished, of course.\"  \\n\\n\"What book? But never mind. Just get your things out of  \\n\\nhere.\"  \\n\\n\"Now?\"  \\n\\n\"Now.\"  \\n\\n\"Good. I don\\'t think I could stand these bugs another  \\n\\nnight.\" The Poet rolled out of bed, but paused for a drink.  \\n\\n\"Give me the wine,\" the abbot ordered.  \\n\\n\"Sure. Have some. It\\'s a pleasant vintage.\"  \\n\\n\"Thank you, since you stole it from our cellars. It happens  \\n\\nto be sacramental wine. Did that occur to you?\"  \\n\\n\"It hasn\\'t been consecrated.\"  \\n\\n\"I\\'m surprised you thought of that.\" Dom Paulo took the  \\n\\nbottle.  \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t steal it anyway. I– \"  \\n\\n\"Never mind the wine. Where did you steal the goat?\"  \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t steal it,\" the poet complained.  \\n\\n\"It just– materialized?\"  \\n\\n\"It was a gift, Reverendissime.\"  \\n\\n\"From whom?\"  \\n\\n\"A dear friend, Domnissime.\"  \\n\\n\"Whose dear friend?\"  \\n\\n\"Mine, Sire.\"  \\n\\n\"Now there\\'s a paradox. Where, now, did you--\"  \\n\\n\"Benjamin, Sire.\"  \\n\\nA flicker of surprise crossed Dom Paulo\\'s face. \"You stole it  \\n\\nfrom old Benjamin?\"  \\n\\nThe Poet winced at the word. \"Please, not stole.\"  \\n\\n\"Then what?\"  \\n\\n\"Benjamin insisted that I take it as a gift after I had  \\n\\ncomposed a sonnet in his honor.\"  \\n\\n\"The truth!\"  \\n\\nThe Poet-sirrah! swallowed sheepishly. \"I won it from him  \\n\\nat mumbly-peg.\"  \\n\\n\"I see.\"  \\n\\n\"It\\'s true! The old wretch nearly cleaned me out, and then  \\n\\nrefused to allow me credit. I had to stake my glass eye \\n\\nagainst the goat. But I won everything back.\" \\n\\n\"Get the goat out of the abbey.\"  \\n\\n\"But it\\'s a marvelous species of goat. The milk is of an  \\n\\nunearthly odor and contains essences. In fact it\\'s  \\n\\nresponsible for the Old Jew\\'s longevity.\"  \\n\\n\"How much of it?\"  \\n\\n\"All fifty-four hundred and eight years of it.\"  \\n\\n\"I thought he was only thirty-two hundred and– \" Dom  \\n\\nPaulo broke off disdainfully. \"What were you doing up on  \\n\\nLast Resort?\"  \\n\\n\"Playing mumbly-peg with old Benjamin.\"  \\n\\n\"I mean– \" The abbot steeled himself. \"Never mind. Just  \\n\\nget yourself moved out. And tomorrow get the goat back \\n\\nto Benjamin.\" \\n\\n\"But I won it fairly.\"  \\n\\n\"We\\'ll not discuss it. Take the goat to the stable, then. I\\'ll  \\n\\nhave it returned to him myself.\"  \\n\\n\"Why?\"  \\n\\n\"We have no use for a goat. Neither have you.\"  \\n\\n\"Ho, ho,\" the Poet said archly.  \\n\\n\"What did that mean, pray?\" \\n\\n\"Thon Taddeo is coming. There\\'ll be need of a goat before \\n\\nit\\'s finished. You can be sure of that.\" He chuckled smugly \\n\\nto himself. \\n\\nThe abbot turned away in irritation. \"Just get out,\" he \\n\\nadded superfluously, and then went to wrestle with \\n\\ncontention in the basement, where the Memorabilia now \\n\\nreposed. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Fourteen  \\n\\nThe vaulted basement had been dug during the centuries \\n\\nof nomadic infiltration from the north, when the Bayring \\n\\nHorde had overrun most of the Plains and desert, looting \\n\\nand vandalizing all villages that lay in their path. The \\n\\nMemorabilia, the abbey\\'s small patrimony of knowledge \\n\\nout of the past, had been walled up in underground vaults \\n\\nto protect the priceless writings from both nomads and \\n\\nsoidisant crusaders of the schismatic Orders, founded to \\n\\nfight the hordes, but turned to random pillaging and \\n\\nsectarian strife. Neither the nomads nor the Military Order \\n\\nof San Pancratz would have valued the abbey\\'s books, but \\n\\nthe nomads would have destroyed them for the joy of \\n\\ndestruction and the military knightsfriars would have \\n\\nburned many of them as \"heretical\" according to the \\n\\ntheology of Vissarion, their Antipope. \\n\\nNow a Dark Age seemed to be passing. For twelve \\n\\ncenturies, a small flame of knowledge had been kept \\n\\nsmoldering in the monasteries; only now were there minds \\n\\nready to be kindled. Long ago, during the last age of \\n\\nreason, certain proud thinkers had claimed that valid \\n\\nknowledge was indestructible– that ideas were deathless \\n\\nand truth immortal. But that was true only in the subtlest \\n\\nsense, the abbot thought, and not superficially true at all. \\n\\nnonmoral logos or design of the Creator; but such \\n\\nmeanings were God\\'s and not Man\\'s, until they found an \\n\\nimperfect incarnation, a dark reflection, within the mind \\n\\nand speech and culture of a given human society, which \\n\\nmight ascribe values to the meanings so that they became \\n\\nvalid in a human sense within the culture. For Man was a \\n\\nculture-bearer as well as a soul-bearer, but his cultures \\n\\nwere not immortal and they could die with a race or an \\n\\nage, and then human reflections of meaning and human \\n\\nportrayals of truth receded, and truth and meaning \\n\\nresided, unseen, only in the objective logos of Nature and \\n\\nthe ineffable Logos of God. Truth could be crucified; but \\n\\nsoon, perhaps, a resurrection. \\n\\nThe Memorabilia was full of ancient words, ancient \\n\\nformulae, ancient reflections of meaning, detached from \\n\\nminds that had died long ago, when a different sort of \\n\\nsociety had passed into oblivion. There was little of it that \\n\\ncould still be understood. Certain papers seemed as \\n\\nmeaningless as a Breviary would seem to a shaman of the \\n\\nnomad tribes. Others retained a certain ornamental beauty \\n\\nor an orderliness that hinted of meaning, as a rosary might \\n\\nsuggest a necklace to a nomad. The earliest brothers of \\n\\nthe Leibowitzian Order had tried to press a sort of \\n\\nVeronica\\'s Veil to the face of a crucified civilization; it had \\n\\ncome away marked with an image of the face of ancient \\n\\ngrandeur, but the image was faintly printed, incomplete, \\n\\nand hard to understand. The monks had preserved the \\n\\nimage, and now it still survived for the world to inspect \\n\\nand try to interpret if the world wanted to do so. The \\n\\nMemorabilia could not, of itself, generate a revival of \\n\\nancient science or high civilization, however, for cultures \\n\\nwere begotten by the tribes of Man, not by musty tomes; \\n\\nbut the books could help, Dom Paulo hoped– the books \\n\\ncould point out directions and offer hints to a newly \\n\\nevolving science. It had happened once before, so the \\n\\nVenerable Boedullus had asserted in his De Vestigiis \\n\\nAntecessarum Civitatum. \\n\\nAnd this time, thought Dom Paulo, we\\'ll keep them \\n\\nreminded of who kept the spark burning while the world \\n\\nslept. He paused to look back; for a moment he had \\n\\nimagined that he had heard a frightened bleat from the \\n\\nPoet\\'s goat. \\n\\nThe clamor from the basement soon blanketed his hearing \\n\\nas he descended the underground stairs toward the souce \\n\\nof the turmoil. Someone was hammering steel pins into \\n\\nstone. Sweat mingled with the odor of old books. A \\n\\nfeverish bustle of unscholarly activity filled the library. \\n\\nNovices hurried past with tools. Novices stood in groups \\n\\nand studied floor plans. Novices shifted desks and tables \\n\\nand heaved at makeshift machinery, rocking it into place. \\n\\nConfusion by lamplight. Brother Armbruster, the librarian \\n\\nand Rector of the Memorabilia, stood watching it from a \\n\\nremote alcove in the shelves, his arms tightly folded and \\n\\nhis face grim. Dom Paulo avoided his accusing gaze. \\n\\nBrother Kornhoer approached his ruler with a lingering grin \\n\\nof enthusiasm. \"Well, Father Abbot, we\\'ll soon have a light \\n\\nsuch as no man alive has ever seen.\" \\n\\n\"This is not without a certain vanity, Brother,\" Paulo \\n\\nreplied. \\n\\n\"Vanity, Domne? To put to good use what we\\'ve learned?\" \\n\\n\"I had in mind our haste to put it to use in time to impress \\n\\na certain visiting scholar. But never mind. Let\\'s see this \\n\\nengineer\\'s wizardry.\" \\n\\nThey walked toward the makeshift machine. It reminded \\n\\nthe abbot of nothing useful, unless one considered engines \\n\\nfor torturing prisoners useful. An axle, serving as the shaft, \\n\\nwas connected by pulleys and belts to a waist-high \\n\\nturnstile. Four wagon wheels were mounted on the axle a \\n\\nfew inches apart. Their thick iron tires were scored with \\n\\ngrooves, and the grooves supported countless birds\\'-nests \\n\\nof copper wire, drawn from coinage at the local smithy in \\n\\nSanly Bowitts. The wheels were apparently free to spin in \\n\\nmid-air, Dom Paulo noticed, for their tires touched no \\n\\nsurface. However, stationary blocks of iron faced the tires, \\n\\nhad been wound with innumerable turns of wire– \"field \\n\\ncoils\" as Kornhoer called them. Dom Paulo solemnly shook \\n\\nhis head. \\n\\n\"It\\'ll be the greatest physical improvement at the abbey \\n\\nsince we got the printing press a hundred years ago,\" \\n\\nKornhoer ventured proudly. \\n\\n\"Will it work?\" Dom Paulo wondered. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll stake a month\\'s extra chores on it, m\\'Lord.\" \\n\\nYou\\'re staking more than that, thought the priest, but \\n\\nsuppressed utterance. \"Where does the light come out?\" \\n\\nhe asked, peering at the odd contraption again. \\n\\nThe monk laughed. \"Oh, we have a special lamp for that. \\n\\nWhat you see here is only the \\'dynamo.\\' It produces the \\n\\nelectrical essence which the lamp will burn.\" \\n\\nRuefully, Dom Paulo contemplated the amount of space \\n\\nthe dynamo was occupying. \"This essence,\" he murmured, \\n\\n\"– can\\'t it be extracted from mutton fat, perhaps?\" \\n\\n\"No, no– The electrical essence is, well– Do you want me \\n\\nto explain?\" \\n\\n\"Better not. Natural science is not my bent. I\\'ll leave it to \\n\\nyou younger heads.\" He stepped back quickly to avoid \\n\\nbeing brained by a timber carried past by a pair of \\n\\nhurrying carpenters. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"if by studying \\n\\nwritings from the Leibowitzian age you can learn how to \\n\\nconstruct this thing, why do you suppose none of our \\n\\npredecessors saw fit to construct it?\" \\n\\nThe monk was silent for a moment. \"It\\'s not easy to \\n\\nexplain,\" he said at last. \"Actually, in the writings that \\n\\nsurvive, there\\'s no direct information about the \\n\\nconstruction of a dynamo. Rather, you might say that the \\n\\ninformation is implicit in a whole collection of fragmentary \\n\\nwritings. Partially implicit. And it has to be got out by \\n\\ndeduction. But to get it, you also need some theories to \\n\\nwork from– theoretical information our predecessors didn\\'t \\n\\nhave.\" \\n\\n\"But we do?\" \\n\\n\"Well, yes– now that there have been a few men like– \" his \\n\\ntone became deeply respectful and he paused before \\n\\npronouncing the name \"– like Thon Taddeo– \" \\n\\n\"Was that a complete sentence?\" the abbot asked rather \\n\\nsourly. \\n\\n\"Well, until recently, few philosophers have concerned \\n\\nthemselves with new theories in physics. Actually, it was \\n\\nthe work of, of Thon Taddeo– \" the respectful tone again, \\n\\nDom Paulo noted, \"– that gave us the necessary working \\n\\naxioms. His work of the Mobility of Electrical Essences, for \\n\\nexample, and his Conservation Theorem– \" \\n\\nwhere is the lamp itself, may I ask? I hope it\\'s no larger \\n\\nthan the dynamo.\" \\n\\n\"This is it, Domne,\" said the monk, picking up a small \\n\\nholding a pair of black rods and a thumbscrew for \\n\\nadjusting their spacing. \"These are carbons,\" Komhoer \\n\\nexplained. \"The ancients would have called it an \\'arc lamp.\\' \\n\\nmake it.\" \\n\\n\"Amazing. Where does the light come from?\" \\n\\n\"Here.\" The monk pointed to the gap between the carbons. \\n\\n\"It must be a very tiny flame,\" said the abbot. \\n\\n\"Oh, but bright! Brighter, I expect, than a hundred \\n\\ncandles.\" \\n\\n\"No!\" \\n\\n\"You find that impressive?\" \\n\\n\"I find it preposterous– \" noticing Brother Kornhoer\\'s \\n\\nsudden hurt expression, the abbot hastily added: \"– to \\n\\nthink how we\\'ve been limping along on beeswax and \\n\\nmutton fat.\" \\n\\n\"I have been wondering,\" the monk shyly confided, \"if the \\n\\nancients used them on their altars instead of candles.\" \\n\\n\"No,\" said the abbot. \"Definitely, no. I can tell you that. \\n\\nPlease dismiss that idea as quickly as possible, and don\\'t \\n\\neven think of it again.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, Father Abbot.\" \\n\\n\"Now, where are you going to hang that thing?\" \\n\\n\"Well– \" Brother Kornhoer paused to stare speculatively \\n\\naround the gloomy basement. \"I hadn\\'t given it any \\n\\nthought. I suppose it should go over the desk where, Thon \\n\\nTaddeo– \" (Why does he pause like that whenever he says \\n\\nit, Dom Paulo wondered irritably.) \"– will be working.\" \\n\\n\"We\\'d better ask Brother Armbruster about that,\" the \\n\\nabbot decided, and then noticing the monk\\'s sudden \\n\\ndiscomfort: \"What\\'s the matter? Have you and Brother \\n\\nArmbruster been– \" \\n\\nKornhoer\\'s face twisted apologetically. \"Really, Father \\n\\nAbbot, I haven\\'t lost my temper with him even once. Oh, \\n\\nwe\\'ve had words, but– \" He shrugged. \"He doesn\\'t want \\n\\nanything moved. He keeps mumbling about witchcraft and \\n\\nthe like. It\\'s not easy to reason with him. His eyes are \\n\\nhalf-blind now from reading by dim light– and yet he says \\n\\nit\\'s Devil\\'s work we\\'re up to. I don\\'t know what to say.\" \\n\\nDom Paulo frowned slightly as they crossed the room \\n\\ntoward the alcove where Brother Armbruster still stood \\n\\nglowering upon the proceedings. \\n\\n\"Well, you\\'ve got your way now,\" the librarian said to \\n\\nKornhoer as they approached. \"When\\'ll you be putting in a \\n\\nmechanical librarian, Brother?\" \\n\\n\"We find hints, Brother, that once there were such things,\" \\n\\nthe inventor growled. \"In descriptions of the Machina \\n\\nanalytica, you\\'ll find references to– \" \\n\\n\"Enough, enough,\" the abbot interposed; then to the \\n\\nyou suggest?\" \\n\\nArmbruster jerked one thumb toward the Natural Science \\n\\nalcove. \"Let him read at the lectern in there like anyone \\n\\nelse.\" \\n\\n\"What about setting up a study for him here on the open \\n\\nfloor, Father Abbot?\" Kornhoer suggested in hasty \\n\\ncounter-proposal. \\n\\n\"Besides a desk, he\\'ll need an abacus, a wall slate, and a \\n\\ndrawing board. We could partition it off with temporary \\n\\nscreens.\" \\n\\n\"I thought he was going to need our Leibowitzian \\n\\nreferences and earliest writings?\" the librarian said \\n\\nsuspiciously. \\n\\n\"He will.\" \\n\\n\"Then he\\'ll have to walk back and forth a lot if you put him \\n\\nin the middle. The rare volumes are chained, and the \\n\\nchains won\\'t reach that far.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s no problem,\" said the inventor. \"Take off the \\n\\nchains. They look silly anyway. The schismatic cults have \\n\\nall died out or become regional. Nobody\\'s heard of the \\n\\nPancratzian Military Order in a hundred years.\" \\n\\nArmbruster reddened angrily. \"Oh no you don\\'t,\" he \\n\\nsnapped. \"The chains stay on.\" \\n\\n\"But why?\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s not the book burners now. It\\'s the villagers we have \\n\\nto worry about. The chains stay on.\" \\n\\nKornhoer turned to the abbot and spread his hands. \"See, \\n\\nm\\'Lord?\" \\n\\nin the village. The town council expropriated our school, \\n\\ndon\\'t forget. Now they\\'ve got a village library, and they \\n\\nwant us to fill its shelves. Preferably with rare volumes, of \\n\\ncourse. Not only that, we had trouble with thieves last \\n\\nyear. Brother Armbruster\\'s right. The rare volumes stay \\n\\nchained.\" \\n\\n\"All right,\" Kornhoer sighed. \"So he\\'ll have to work in the \\n\\nalcove?\" \\n\\n\"Now, where do we hang your wondrous lamp?\" \\n\\nThe monks glanced toward the cubicle. It was one of \\n\\nfourteen identical stalls, sectioned according to subject \\n\\nmatter, which faced the central floor. Each alcove had its \\n\\narchway, and from an iron hook imbedded in the keystone \\n\\nof each arch hung a heavy crucifix. \\n\\n\"Well, if he\\'s going to work in the alcove,\" said Kornhoer, \\n\\n\"we\\'ll just have to take the crucifix down and hang it there, \\n\\ntemporarily. There\\'s no other– \" \\n\\n\"Heathen!\" hissed the librarian. \"Pagan! Desecrator!\" \\n\\nArmbruster raised trembling hands heavenward. \"God help \\n\\nstop? Take him away, away!\" He turned his back on them, \\n\\nhis hands still trembling aloft. \\n\\nDom Paulo himself had winced slightly at the inventor\\'s \\n\\nsuggestion, but now he frowned sharply at the back of \\n\\nBrother Armbruster\\'s habit. He had never expected him to \\n\\nfeign a meekness that was alien to Armbruster\\'s nature, \\n\\nbut the aged monk\\'s querulous disposition had grown \\n\\ndefinitely worse. \\n\\n\"Brother Armbruster, turn around, please.\" \\n\\nThe librarian turned. \\n\\n\"Now drop your hands, and speak more calmly when you– \\n\\n\" \\n\\n\"But, Father Abbot, you heard what he– \" \\n\\n\"Brother Armbruster, you will please get the shelf-ladder \\n\\nand remove that crucifix.\" \\n\\nThe color left the librarian\\'s face. He stared speechless at \\n\\nDom Paulo. \\n\\n\"This is not a church,\" said the abbot. \"The placement of \\n\\nimages is optional. For the present, you will please take \\n\\ndown the crucifix. It\\'s the only suitable place for the lamp, \\n\\nit seems. Later we may change it. Now I realize this whole \\n\\nthing has disturbed your library, and perhaps your \\n\\ndigestion, but we hope it\\'s in the interests of progress. If it \\n\\nisn\\'t, then– \" \\n\\n\"You\\'d make Our Lord move over to make room for \\n\\nprogress!\" \\n\\n\"Brother Armbruster!\" \\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you just hang the witch-light around His neck?\" \\n\\nThe abbot\\'s face went frigid. \"I do not force your \\n\\nobedience, Brother. See me in my study after Compline.\" \\n\\nThe librarian wilted. \"I\\'ll get the ladder, Father Abbot,\" he \\n\\nwhispered, and shuffled unsteadily away. \\n\\nDom Paulo glanced up at the Christ of the rood in the \\n\\narchway. Do You mind? he wondered. \\n\\nThere was a knot in his stomach. He knew the knot would \\n\\nexact its price of him later. He left the basement before \\n\\nanyone could notice his discomfort. It was not good to let \\n\\nthe community see how such trivial unpleasantness could \\n\\novercome him these days. \\n\\nThe installation was completed the following day, but Dom \\n\\nPaulo remained in his study during the test. Twice he had \\n\\nbeen forced to warn Brother Armbruster privately, and \\n\\nthen to rebuke him publicly during Chapter. And yet he felt \\n\\nmore sympathy for the librarian\\'s stand than he did for \\n\\nKornhoer\\'s. He sat slumped at his desk and waited for the \\n\\nnews from the basement, feeling small concern for the \\n\\ntest\\'s success or failure. He kept one hand tucked into the \\n\\nfront of his habit. He patted his stomach as though trying \\n\\nto calm a hysterical child. \\n\\nInternal cramping again. It seemed to come whenever \\n\\nunpleasantness threatened, and sometimes went away \\n\\nagain when unpleasantness exploded into the open where \\n\\nhe could wrestle with it. But now it was not going away. \\n\\nHe was being warned, and he knew it. Whether the \\n\\nwarning came from an angel, from a demon, or from his \\n\\nown conscience, it told him to beware of himself and of \\n\\nsome reality not yet faced. \\n\\nWhat now? he wondered, permitting himself a silent belch \\n\\nand a silent Beg pardon toward the statue of Saint \\n\\nLeibowitz in the shrinelike niche in the corner of his study. \\n\\nA fly was crawling along Saint Leibowitz\\' nose. The eyes of \\n\\nthe saint seemed to be looking crosseyed at the fly, urging \\n\\nthe abbot to brush it away. The abbot had grown fond of \\n\\nthe twenty-sixth century wood carving; its face wore a \\n\\ncurious smile of a sort that made it rather unusual as a \\n\\nsacramental image. The smile was turned down at one \\n\\nfrown, although there were laugh-wrinkles at the corners \\n\\nof the eyes. Because of the hangman\\'s rope over one \\n\\nshoulder, the saint\\'s expression often seemed puzzling. \\n\\nPossibly it resulted from slight irregularities in the grain of \\n\\nthe wood, such irregularities dictating to the carver\\'s hand \\n\\nas that hand sought to bring out finer details than were \\n\\npossible with such wood. Dom Paulo was not certain \\n\\nwhether the image had been growth-sculptured as a living \\n\\ntree before carving or not; sometimes the patient \\n\\nmaster-carvers of that period had begun with an oak or \\n\\nbarking, twisting, and tying living branches into desired \\n\\npositions– had tormented the growing wood into a striking \\n\\ndryad shape, arms folded or raised aloft, before cutting the \\n\\nmature tree for curing and carving. The resulting statue \\n\\nwas unusually resistant to splitting or breaking, since most \\n\\nof the lines of the work followed the natural grain. \\n\\nDom Paulo often marveled that the wooden Leibowitz had \\n\\nalso proved resistant to several centuries of his \\n\\npredecessors– marveled because of the saint\\'s most \\n\\npeculiar smile. That little grin will ruin you someday, he \\n\\nwarned the image. . . Surely, the saints must laugh in \\n\\nHeaven; the Psalmist says that God Himself shall chortle, \\n\\nbut Abbot Malmeddy must have disapproved– God rest his \\n\\nsoul. That solemn ass. How did you get by him, I wonder? \\n\\nYou\\'re not sanctimonious enough for some. That smile– \\n\\nWho do I know that grins that way? I like it, but . . . \\n\\nSomeday, another grim dog will sit in this chair. Cave \\n\\ncanem. He\\'ll replace you with a plaster Leibowitz. \\n\\nLong-suffering. One who doesn\\'t look crosseyed at flies. \\n\\nThen you\\'ll be eaten by termites down in the storage \\n\\nroom. To survive the Church\\'s slow sifting of the arts, you \\n\\nhave to have a surface that can please a righteous \\n\\nsimpleton; and yet you need a depth beneath that surface \\n\\nto please a discerning sage. The sifting is slow, but it gets \\n\\na turn of the sifter-handle now and then– when some new \\n\\nprelate inspects his episcopal chambers and mutters, \\n\\n\"Some of this garbage has got to go.\" The sifter was \\n\\nusually full of dulcet pap. When the old pap was ground \\n\\nout, fresh pap was added. But what was not ground out \\n\\nwas gold, and it lasted. If a church endured five centuries \\n\\nof priestly bad taste, occasional good taste had, by then, \\n\\nusually stripped away most of the transient tripe, had \\n\\nmade it a place of majesty that overawed the would-be \\n\\nprettifiers. \\n\\nThe abbot fanned himself with a fan of buzzard feathers, \\n\\nbut the breeze was not cooling. The air from the window \\n\\nwas like an oven\\'s breath off the scorched desert, adding \\n\\nto the discomfort caused him by whatever devil or ruthless \\n\\nangel was fiddling around with his belly. It was the kind of \\n\\nheat that hints of lurking danger from sun-crazed rattlers \\n\\nand brooding thunderstorms over the mountains, of rabid \\n\\ndogs and tempers made vicious by the scorch. It made the \\n\\ncramping worse. \\n\\n\"Please?\" he murmured aloud to the saint, meaning a \\n\\nnonverbal prayer for cooler weather, sharper wits, and \\n\\nmore insight into his vague sense of something wrong. \\n\\nMaybe it\\'s that cheese that does it, he thought. Gummy \\n\\ntake a more digestible diet. \\n\\nBut no, there we go again. Face it, Paulo: it\\'s not the food \\n\\nfor the belly that does it; it\\'s the food for the brain. \\n\\nSomething up there is not digesting. \\n\\n\"But what?\" \\n\\nThe wooden saint gave him no ready answer. Pap. Sifting \\n\\nout chaff. Sometimes his mind worked in snatches. It was \\n\\nbetter to let it work that way when the cramps came and \\n\\nthe world weighed heavily upon him. What did the world \\n\\nweigh? It weighs, but is not weighed. Sometimes its scales \\n\\nare crooked. It weighs life and labor in the balance against \\n\\nsilver and gold. That\\'ll never balance. But fast and \\n\\nruthless, it keeps on weighing. It spills a lot of life that \\n\\nway, and sometimes a little gold. And blindfolded, a king \\n\\ncomes riding across the desert, with a set of crooked \\n\\nscales, a pair of loaded dice. And upon the flags \\n\\nemblazoned– Vexilla regis. \\n\\n\"No!\" the abbot grunted, suppressing the vision. \\n\\nBut of course! the saint\\'s wooden smile seemed to insist. \\n\\nDom Paulo averted his eyes from the image with a slight \\n\\nshudder. Sometimes he felt that the saint was laughing at \\n\\nhim. Do they laugh at us in Heaven? he wondered. Saint \\n\\nMaisie of York herself– remember her, old man– she died \\n\\nof a laughing fit. That\\'s different. She died laughing at \\n\\nherself. No, that\\'s not so different either. Ulp! The silent \\n\\nbelch again. Tuesday\\'s Saint Maisie\\'s feast day, forsooth. \\n\\nChoir laughs reverently at the Alleluia of her Mass. \"Alleluia \\n\\nha ha! Alleluia ho ho!\" \\n\\n\"Sancta Maisie, interride pro me.\" \\n\\nAnd the king was coming to weigh books in the basement \\n\\nwith his pair of crooked scales. How \"crooked,\" Paulo? And \\n\\nwhat makes you think the Memorabilia is completely free \\n\\nof pap? Even the gifted and Venerable Boedullus once \\n\\nremarked scornfully that about half of it should be called \\n\\nthe Inscrutabilia. Treasured fragments of a dead \\n\\ncivilization there were indeed– but how much of it has \\n\\nbeen reduced to gibberish, embellished with olive leaves \\n\\nand cherubims, by forty generations of us monastic \\n\\nby adults with an incomprehensible message, to be \\n\\nmemorized and delivered to other adults. \\n\\nI made him travel all the way from Texarkana through \\n\\ndangerous country, thought Paulo. Now I\\'m just worrying \\n\\nthat what we\\'ve got may prove worthless to him, that\\'s all. \\n\\nBut no, that wasn\\'t all. He glanced at the smiling saint \\n\\nagain. And again: Vexilla regis inferni prodeunt. . . Forth \\n\\ncome the banners of the King of Hell, whispered a memory \\n\\nof that perverted line from an ancient commedia. It \\n\\nnagged like an unwanted tune in his thought. \\n\\nthrough his teeth. He avoided looking at the saint again. \\n\\nThe ruthless angel ambushed him with a hot burst at his \\n\\ncorporeal core. He leaned over the desk. That one had felt \\n\\nlike a hot wire breaking. His hard breathing swept a clean \\n\\nspot in the film of desert dust on the desktop. The smell of \\n\\nthe dust was choking. The room went pink, swarmed with \\n\\nblack gnats. I don\\'t dare belch, might shake something \\n\\nloose– but Holy Saint and Patron I\\'ve got to. Pain is. Ergo \\n\\nsum. Lord Christ God accept this token. \\n\\nHe belched, tasted salt, let his head fall onto the desk. \\n\\nDoes the chalice have to be now right this very minute \\n\\nLord or can I wait awhile? But crucifixion is always now. \\n\\nNow ever since before Abraham even is always now. \\n\\nBefore Pfardentrott even, now. Always for everybody \\n\\nanyhow is to get nailed on it and then to hang on it and if \\n\\nyou drop off they beat you to death with a shovel so do it \\n\\nwith dignity old man. If you can belch with dignity you may \\n\\nget to Heaven if you\\'re sorry enough about messing up the \\n\\nrug. . . . He felt very apologetic. \\n\\nHe waited a long time. Some of the gnats died and the \\n\\nroom lost its blush but went hazy and gray. \\n\\nWell, Paulo, are we going to hemorrhage now, or are we \\n\\njust going to fool around about it? \\n\\nHe probed the haze and found the face of the saint again. \\n\\nIt was such a small grin– sad, understanding, and, \\n\\nsomething else. Laughing at the hangman? No, laughing \\n\\nfor the hangman. Laughing at the Stultus Maximus, at \\n\\nSatan himself. It was the first time he had seen it clearly. \\n\\nIn the last chalice, there could be a chuckle of triumph. \\n\\nHaec commixtio. \\n\\nHe was suddenly very sleepy; the saint\\'s face grayed over, \\n\\nbut the abbot continued to grin weakly in response. \\n\\nPrior Gault found him slumped over the desk shortly before \\n\\nNone. Blood showed between his teeth. The young priest \\n\\nquickly felt for a pulse. Dom Paulo awakened at once, \\n\\nstraightened in his chair, and, as if still in a dream, he \\n\\npontificated imperiously: \"I tell you, it\\'s all supremely \\n\\nridiculous! It\\'s absolutely idiotic! Nothing could be more \\n\\nabsurd.\" \\n\\n\"What\\'s absurd, Domne?\" \\n\\nThe abbot shook his head, blinked several times. \"What?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ll get Brother Andrew at once.\" \\n\\n\"Oh? That\\'s absurd. Come back here. What did you want?\" \\n\\n\"Nothing, Father Abbot. I\\'ll be back as soon as I get  \\n\\nBrother– \" \\n\\n\"Oh, bother the medic! You didn\\'t come in here for \\n\\nnothing. My door was closed. Close it again, sit down, say \\n\\nwhat you wanted.\" \\n\\n\"The test was successful. Brother Kornhoer\\'s lamp, I \\n\\nmean.\" \\n\\n\"All right, let\\'s hear about it. Sit down, start talking, tell \\n\\nme alllll about it.\" He straightened his habit and blotted his \\n\\nmouth with a bit of linen. He was still dizzy, but the fist in \\n\\nhis belly had come unclenched. He could not have cared \\n\\nless about the prior\\'s account of the test, but he tried his \\n\\nawake enough to think. Can\\'t let him go for the medic– not \\n\\nto decide whether it\\'s a safe time to be finished or not. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Fifteen  \\n\\nHongan Os was essentially a just and kindly man. When he \\n\\nsaw a party of his warriors making sport of the Laredan \\n\\ncaptives, he paused to watch; but when they tied three \\n\\nLaredans by their ankles between horses and whipped the \\n\\nhorses into frenzied flight, Hongan Os decided to \\n\\nintervene. He ordered that the warriors be flogged on the \\n\\nspot, for Hongan Os– Mad Bear– was known to be a \\n\\nmerciful chieftain. He had never mistreated a horse. \\n\\n\"Killing captives is woman\\'s work,\" he growled scornfully at \\n\\nthe whipped culprits. \"Cleanse yourselves lest you be \\n\\nsquaw-marked, and withdraw from camp until the New \\n\\nMoon, for you are banished twelve days.\" And, answering \\n\\ntheir moans of protest: \"Suppose the horses had dragged \\n\\none of them through camp? The grass-eater chieflings are \\n\\nour guests, and it is known that they are easily frightened \\n\\nby blood. Especially the blood of their own kind. Take \\n\\nheed.\" \\n\\n\"But these are grass-eaters from the South,\" a warrior \\n\\nobjected, gesturing toward the mutilated captives. \"Our \\n\\nguests are grasseaters from the East. Is there not a pact \\n\\nbetween us real people and the East to make war upon the \\n\\nSouth?\"  \\n\\n\"If you speak of it again, your tongue shall be cut out and \\n\\nfed to the dogs!\" Mad Bear warned. \"Forget that you heard \\n\\nsuch things.\" \\n\\n\"Will the herb-men be among us for many days, O Son of \\n\\nthe Mighty?\" \\n\\n\"Who can know what the farmer-things plan?\" Mad Bear \\n\\nasked crossly. \"Their thought is not as our thought. They \\n\\nsay that some of their numbers will depart from here to \\n\\npass on across the Dry Lands– to a place of the \\n\\ngrass-eater priests, a place of the dark-robed ones. The \\n\\nothers will stay here to talk– but that is not for your ears. \\n\\nNow go, and be ashamed twelve days.\" \\n\\nHe turned his back that they might slink away without \\n\\nfeeling his gaze pour upon them. Discipline was becoming \\n\\nlax of late. The clans were restless. It had become known \\n\\namong the people of the Plains that he, Hongan Os, had \\n\\nclasped arms across a treaty-fire with a messenger from \\n\\nTexarkana, and that a shaman had clipped hair and \\n\\nfingernails from each of them to make a good-faith doll as \\n\\na defense against treachery by either party. It was known \\n\\nthat an agreement had been made, and any agreement \\n\\nbetween people and grass-eaters was regarded by the \\n\\ntribes as a cause for shame. Mad Bear had felt the veiled \\n\\nto them until the right time came. \\n\\nMad Bear himself was willing to listen to good thought, \\n\\neven if it came from a dog. The thought of grass-eaters \\n\\nwas seldom good, but he had been impressed by the \\n\\nmessages of the grass-eater king in the east, who had \\n\\nexpounded the value of secrecy and deplored the idle \\n\\nboast. If the Laredans learned that the tribes were being \\n\\narmed by Hannegan, the plan would surely fail. Mad Bear \\n\\nhad brooded on this thought; it repelled him– for certainly \\n\\nit was more satisfying and more manly to tell an enemy \\n\\nwhat one intended to do to him before doing it; and yet, \\n\\nthe more he brooded on it, the more he saw its wisdom. \\n\\nEither the grass-eater king was a craven coward, or else \\n\\nhe was almost as wise as a man: Mad Bear had not \\n\\ndecided which– but he judged the thought itself as wise. \\n\\nSecrecy was essential, even if it seemed womanly for a \\n\\ntime. If Mad Bear\\'s own people knew that the arms which \\n\\ncame to them were gifts from Hannegan, and not really \\n\\nthe spoils of border raids, then there would arise the \\n\\npossibility of Laredo\\'s learning of the scheme from captives \\n\\ntribes grumble about the shame of talking peace with the \\n\\nfarmers of the east. \\n\\nBut the talk was not of peace. The talk was good, and it \\n\\npromised loot. \\n\\nA few weeks ago, Mad Bear himself had led a \"war party\" \\n\\nto the east and had returned with a hundred head of \\n\\nhorses, four dozen long rifles, several kegs of black \\n\\npowder, ample shot, and one prisoner. But not even the \\n\\nwarriors who had accompanied him knew that the cache of \\n\\narms had been planted there for him by Hannegan\\'s men, \\n\\nor that the prisoner was in reality a Texarkanan cavalry \\n\\nofficer who would in the future advise Mad Bear about \\n\\nprobable Laredan tactics during the fighting to come. All \\n\\ngrass-eater thought was shameless, but the officer\\'s \\n\\nthought could probe that of the grass-eaters to the south. \\n\\nIt could not probe that of Hongan Os. \\n\\nMad Bear was justifiably proud of himself as a bargainer. \\n\\nHe had pledged nothing but to refrain from making war \\n\\nupon Texarkana and to stop stealing cattle from the \\n\\neastern borders, but only as long as Hannegan furnished \\n\\nhim with arms and supplies. The agreement to war against \\n\\nLaredo was an unspoken pledge of the fire, but it fitted \\n\\nMad Bear\\'s natural inclinations, and there was no need for \\n\\na formal pact. Alliance with one of his enemies would \\n\\npermit him to deal with one foe at a time, and eventually \\n\\nhe might regain the grazing lands that had been \\n\\nencroached upon and settled by the farmer-people during \\n\\nthe previous century. \\n\\nNight had fallen by the time the clans chief rode into camp, \\n\\nand a chill had come over the Plains. His guests from the \\n\\neast sat huddled in their blankets around the council fire \\n\\nwith three of the old people while the usual ring of curious \\n\\nchildren gaped from surrounding shadows and peeped \\n\\nunder tent skirts at the strangers. There were twelve \\n\\nstrangers in all, but they separated themselves into two \\n\\ndistinct parties which had traveled together but apparently \\n\\ncared little for each other\\'s company. The leader of one \\n\\nparty was obviously a madman. While Mad Bear did not \\n\\nobject to insanity (indeed, it was prized by his shamans as \\n\\nthe most intense of supernatural visitations), he had not \\n\\nknown that the farmers likewise regarded madness as a \\n\\nvirtue in a leader. But this one spent half of his time \\n\\ndigging in the earth down by the dry riverbed and the \\n\\nother half jotting mysteriously in a small book. Obviously a \\n\\nwitch, and probably not to be trusted. \\n\\nMad Bear stopped only long enough to don his ceremonial \\n\\nwolf robes and have a shaman paint the totem mark on his \\n\\nforehead before he joined the group at the fire. \\n\\n\"Be afraid!\" an old warrior ceremonially wailed as the clans \\n\\nchief stepped into the firelight. \"Be afraid, for the Mighty \\n\\nOne walks among his children. Grovel, O clans, for his \\n\\nname is Mad Bear– a name well won, for as a youth he did \\n\\novercome without weapons a bear run mad, with his naked \\n\\nhands did he strangle her, verily in the Northlands. . .\" \\n\\nHongan Os ignored the eulogies and accepted a cup of \\n\\nblood from the old woman who served the council fire. It \\n\\nwas fresh from a butchered steer and still warm. He \\n\\ndrained it before turning to nod at the Easterners who \\n\\nwatched the brief wassail with apparent disquiet. \\n\\n\"Aaaah!\" said the clans chief. \\n\\n\"Aaaah!\" replied the three old people, together with one \\n\\ngrasseater who dared to chime in. The people stared at the \\n\\ngrass-eater for a moment in disgust. \\n\\nThe insane one tried to cover his companion\\'s blunder. \\n\\n\"Tell me,\" said the madman when the chieftain was \\n\\nseated. \"How is it that your people drink no water? Do \\n\\nyour gods object?\" \\n\\n\"Who knows what the gods drink?\" rumbled Mad Bear. \"It \\n\\nis said that water is for cattle and farmers, that milk is for \\n\\nchildren and blood for men. Should it be otherwise?\" \\n\\nThe insane one was not insulted. He studied the chief for a \\n\\nmoment with searching gray eyes, then nodded at one of \\n\\nhis fellows. \"That \\'water for the cattle\\' explains it,\" he said. \\n\\n\"The everlasting drought out here. A herdsman people \\n\\nwould conserve what little water there is for the animals. I \\n\\nwas wondering if they backed it by a religious taboo.\" \\n\\nHis companion grimaced and spoke in the Texarkanan \\n\\ntongue. \"Water! Ye gods, why can\\'t we drink water, Thon \\n\\nTaddeo? There\\'s such a thing as too much conformity!\" He \\n\\nspat dryly. \"Blood! Bah! It sticks in the throat. Why can\\'t \\n\\nwe have one little sip of– \" \\n\\n\"Not until we leave!\" \\n\\n\"But, Thon– \" \\n\\npeople were glowering at them, he spoke to Mad Bear in \\n\\ntongue of the Plains again. \"My comrade here was \\n\\nspeaking of the manliness and health of your people,\" he \\n\\nsaid. \"Perhaps your diet is responsible.\" \\n\\n\"Ha!\" barked the chief, but then called almost cheerfully to \\n\\nthe old woman: \"Give that outlander a cup of red.\" \\n\\nThon Taddeo\\'s companion shuddered, but made no \\n\\nprotest. \\n\\nsaid the scholar. \"Tomorrow we shall continue our journey \\n\\nto the west. If some of your warriors could accompany our \\n\\nparty, we would be honored.\" \\n\\n\"Why?\" \\n\\nThon Taddeo paused. \"Why– as guides . . .\" He stopped, \\n\\nand suddenly smiled. \"No, I\\'ll be quite truthful. Some of \\n\\nyour people disapprove of our presence here. While your \\n\\nhospitality has been– \" \\n\\nHongan Os threw back his head and roared with laughter. \\n\\n\"They are afraid of the lesser clans,\" he said to the old \\n\\nones. \"They fear being ambushed as soon as they leave \\n\\nmy tents. They eat grass and are afraid of a fight.\" \\n\\nThe scholar flushed slightly. \\n\\n\"Fear nothing, outlander!\" chortled the clans chief. \"Real \\n\\nmen shall accompany you.\" \\n\\nThon Taddeo inclined his head in mock gratitude. \\n\\n\"Tell us,\" said Mad Bear, \"what is it you go to seek in the \\n\\nwestern Dry Land? New places for planting fields? I can tell \\n\\nyou there are none. Except near a few water holes, \\n\\nnothing grows that even cattle will eat.\" \\n\\n\"We seek no new land,\" the visitor answered. \"We are not \\n\\nall of us farmers, you know. We are going to look for– \" He \\n\\npaused. In the nomad speech, there was no way to explain \\n\\nthe purpose of the journey to the Abbey of St. Leibowitz \"– \\n\\nfor the skills of an ancient sorcery.\" \\n\\nOne of the old ones, a shaman, seemed to prick up his \\n\\nears. \"An ancient sorcery in the west? I know of no \\n\\nmagicians there. Unless you mean the dark-robed ones?\" \\n\\n\"They are the ones.\"  \\n\\n\"Ha! What magic do they have that\\'s worth looking after? \\n\\nTheir messengers can be captured so easily that it is no \\n\\nreal sport– although they do endure torture well. What \\n\\nsorcery can you learn from them?\" \\n\\n\"Well, for my part, I agree with you,\" said Thon Taddeo. \\n\\n\"But it is said that writings, uh, incantations of great power \\n\\nare hoarded at one of their abodes. If it is true, then \\n\\nobviously the dark-robed ones don\\'t know how to use \\n\\nthem, but we hope to master them for ourselves.\" \\n\\n\"Will the dark-robes permit you to observe their secrets?\" \\n\\nThon Taddeo smiled. \"I think so. They don\\'t dare hide \\n\\nthem any longer. We could take them, if we had to.\" \\n\\n\"A brave saying,\" scoffed Mad Bear. \"Evidently the farmers \\n\\nare braver among their own kind– although they are meek \\n\\nenough among real people.\" \\n\\nThe scholar, who had stomached his fill of the nomad\\'s \\n\\ninsults, chose to retire early. \\n\\nThe soldiers remained at the council fire to discuss with \\n\\nHongan Os the war that was certain to come; but the war, \\n\\nafter all, was none of Thon Taddeo\\'s affair. The political \\n\\naspirations of his ignorant cousin were far from his own \\n\\ninterest in a revival of learning in a dark world, except \\n\\nwhen that monarch\\'s patronage proved useful, as it \\n\\nalready had upon several occasions. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Sixteen  \\n\\nThe old hermit stood at the edge of the mesa and watched \\n\\nthe approach of the dust speck across the desert. The \\n\\nhermit munched, muttered words and chuckled silently \\n\\ninto the wind. His withered hide was burned the color of \\n\\nold leather by the sun, and his brushy beard was stained \\n\\nyellow about the chin. He wore a basket hat and a loincloth \\n\\nof rough homespun that resembled burlap-- his only \\n\\nclothing except for sandals and a goatskin water bag. \\n\\nHe watched the dust speck until it passed through the \\n\\nvillage of Sanly Bowitts and departed again by way of the \\n\\nroad leading past the mesa. \\n\\n\"Ah!\" snorted the hermit, his eyes beginning to burn. \"His \\n\\nempire shall be multiplied, and there shall be no end of his \\n\\npeace: he shall sit upon his kingdom.\" \\n\\nSuddenly he went down the arroyo like a cat with three \\n\\nlegs, using his staff, bounding from stone to stone and \\n\\nsliding most of the way. The dust from his rapid descent \\n\\nplumed high on the wind and wandered away. \\n\\nAt the foot of the mesa he vanished into the mesquite and \\n\\nsettled down to wait. Soon he heard the rider approaching \\n\\nat a lazy trot, and he began slinking toward the road to \\n\\npeer out through the brush. The pony appeared from \\n\\naround the bend, wrapped in a thin dust shroud. The \\n\\nhermit darted into the trail and threw up his arms. \\n\\n\"Olla allay!\" he shouted; and as the rider halted, he darted \\n\\nforward to seize the reins and frown anxiously up at the \\n\\nman in the saddle. \\n\\nHis eyes blazed for a moment. \"For a Child is born to us, \\n\\nand a Son is given us . . .\" But then the anxious frown \\n\\nmelted away into sadness. \"It\\'s not Him!\" he grumbled \\n\\nirritably at the sky. \\n\\nThe rider had thrown back his hood and was laughing. The \\n\\nhermit blinked angrily at him for a moment. Recognition \\n\\ndawned. \\n\\n\"Oh,\" he grunted. \"You! I thought you\\'d be dead by now. \\n\\nWhat are you doing out here?\" \\n\\n\"I brought back your prodigal, Benjamin,\" said Dom Paulo. \\n\\nHe tugged at a leash and the blue-headed goat trotted up \\n\\nfrom behind the pony. It bleated and strained at the rope \\n\\nupon seeing the hermit. \"And. . . I thought I\\'d pay you a \\n\\nvisit.\" \\n\\n\"The animal is the Poet\\'s,\" the hermit grunted. \"He won it \\n\\nfairly in a game of chance– although he cheated miserably. \\n\\nTake it back to him, and let me counsel you against \\n\\nmeddling in worldly swindles that don\\'t concern you. Good \\n\\nday.\" He turned toward the arroyo. \\n\\n\"Wait, Benjamin. Take your goat, or I\\'ll give it to a \\n\\npeasant. I won\\'t have it wandering around the abbey and \\n\\nbleating into the church.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s not a goat,\" the hermit said crossly. \"It\\'s the beast \\n\\nwhich your prophet saw, and it was made for a woman to \\n\\nride. I suggest you curse it and drive it into the desert. You \\n\\nnotice, however, that it divideth the hoof and cheweth the \\n\\ncud.\" He started away again. \\n\\nThe abbot\\'s smile faded. \"Benjamin, are you really going \\n\\nback up that hill without even a \\'hello\\' for an old friend?\" \\n\\n\"Hello,\" the Old Jew called back, and marched indignantly \\n\\non. After a few steps he stopped to glance over his \\n\\nshoulder. \"You needn\\'t look so hurt,\" he said. \"It\\'s been \\n\\nfive years since you\\'ve troubled to come this way, \\'old  \\n\\nfriend.\\' Hah!\"  \\n\\n\"So that\\'s it!\" muttered the abbot. He dismounted and  \\n\\nhurried after the Old Jew. \"Benjamin, Benjamin, I would  \\n\\nhave come– I have not been free.\"  \\n\\nThe hermit stopped. \"Well, Paulo, since you\\'re here. . .\"  \\n\\nSuddenly they laughed and embraced.  \\n\\n\"It\\'s good, you old grump,\" said the hermit.  \\n\\n\"I a grump?\"  \\n\\n\"Well, I\\'m getting cranky too, I guess. The last century has  \\n\\nbeen a trying one for me.\"  \\n\\n\"I hear you\\'ve been throwing rocks at the novices who  \\n\\ncome hereabouts for their Lenten fast in the desert. Can \\n\\nthis be true?\" He eyed the hermit with mock reproof. \\n\\n\"Only pebbles.\" \\n\\n\"Miserable old pretzel!\"  \\n\\n\"Now, now, Paulo. One of them once mistook me for a \\n\\ndistant relative of mine– name of Leibowitz. He thought I \\n\\nhad been sent to deliver him a message– or some of your \\n\\nother scalawags thought so. I don\\'t want it to happen \\n\\nagain, so I throw pebbles at them sometimes. Hah! I\\'ll not \\n\\nany kin of mine.\" \\n\\nThe priest looked puzzled. \"Mistook you for whom? Saint \\n\\nLeibowitz? Now, Benjamin! You\\'re going too far.\" \\n\\nBenjamin repeated it in a mocking singsong: \"Mistook me \\n\\nfor a distant relative of mine– name of Leibowitz, so I \\n\\nthrow pebbles at them.\" \\n\\nDom Paulo looked thoroughly perplexed. \"Saint Leibowitz \\n\\nhas been dead a dozen centuries. How could– \" He broke \\n\\noff and peered warily at the old hermit. \"Now, Benjamin, \\n\\nlet\\'s don\\'t start that tale wagging again. You haven\\'t lived \\n\\ntwelve cent– \" \\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" interrupted the Old Jew. \"I didn\\'t say it \\n\\nhappened twelve centuries ago. It was only six centuries \\n\\nago. Long after your Saint was dead; that\\'s why it was so \\n\\npreposterous. Of course, your novices were more devout in \\n\\nthose days, and more credulous. I think Francis was that  \\n\\none\\'s name. Poor fellow. I buried him later. Told them in \\n\\nNew Rome where to dig for him. That\\'s how you got his \\n\\ncarcass back.\" \\n\\nThe abbot gaped at the old man as they walked through \\n\\nthe mesquite toward the water hole, leading the horse and \\n\\nthe goat. Francis? he wondered. Francis. That could be the \\n\\nVenerable Francis Gerard of Utah, perhaps?– to whom a \\n\\npilgrim had once revealed the location of the old shelter in \\n\\nthe village, so that story went– but that was before the \\n\\nvillage was there. And about six centuries ago, yes, and– \\n\\nnow this old gaffer was claiming to have been that pilgrim? \\n\\nHe sometimes wondered where Benjamin had picked up \\n\\nenough knowledge of the abbey\\'s history to invent such \\n\\ntales. From the Poet, perhaps. \\n\\nwent on, \"and perhaps such a mistake was \\n\\nunderstandable.\" \\n\\n\"Earlier career?\" \\n\\n\"Wanderer.\" \\n\\n\"How do you expect me to believe such nonsense?\" \\n\\n\"Hmm-hnnn! The Poet believes me.\" \\n\\n\"Undoubtedly! The Poet certainly would never believe that \\n\\nthe Venerable Francis met a saint. That would be \\n\\nsuperstition. The Poet would rather believe he met you– \\n\\nsix centuries ago. A purely natural explanation, eh?\" \\n\\nBenjamin chuckled wryly. Paulo watched him lower a leaky \\n\\nbark cup into the well, empty it into his water skin, and \\n\\nlower it again for more. The water was cloudy and alive \\n\\nwith creeping uncertainties as was the Old Jew\\'s stream of \\n\\nmemory. Or was his memory uncertain? Playing games \\n\\nwith us all? wondered the priest. Except for his delusion of \\n\\nbeing older than Methuselah, old Benjamin Eleazar seemed \\n\\nsane enough, in his own wry way. \\n\\n\"Drink?\" the hermit offered, extending the cup. \\n\\nThe abbot suppressed a shudder, but accepted the cup so \\n\\nas not to offend; he drained the murky liquid at a gulp. \\n\\n\"Not very particular, are you?\" said Benjamin, watching \\n\\nhim critically. \"Wouldn\\'t touch it myself.\" He patted the \\n\\nwater skin. \"For the animals.\"  \\n\\nThe abbot gagged slightly. \\n\\n\"You\\'ve changed,\" said Benjamin, still watching him. \\n\\n\"You\\'ve grown pale as cheese and wasted.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ve been ill.\" \\n\\n\"You look ill. Come up to my shack, if the climb won\\'t tire \\n\\nyou out.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ll be all right. I had a little trouble the other day, and our \\n\\nphysician told me to rest. Fah! If an important guest \\n\\nweren\\'t coming soon, I\\'d pay no attention. But he\\'s \\n\\ncoming, so I\\'m resting. It\\'s quite tiresome.\" \\n\\nBenjamin glanced back at him with a grin as they climbed \\n\\nthe arroyo. He waggled his grizzly head. \"Riding ten miles \\n\\nacross the desert is resting?\" \\n\\n\"For me it\\'s rest. And, I\\'ve been wanting to see you, \\n\\nBenjamin.\" \\n\\n\"What will the villagers say?\" the Old Jew asked mockingly.  \\n\\n\"They\\'ll think we\\'ve become reconciled, and that will spoil \\n\\nboth our reputations.\" \\n\\n\"Our reputations never have amounted to much in the \\n\\nmarket place, have they?\" \\n\\n\"True,\" he admitted, but added cryptically: \"for the \\n\\npresent.\" \\n\\n\"Still waiting, Old Jew?\" \\n\\n\"Certainly!\" the hermit snapped. \\n\\nThe abbot found the climb tiring. Twice they stopped to \\n\\nrest. By the time they reached the tableland, he had \\n\\nbecome dizzy and was leaning on the spindly hermit for \\n\\nsupport. A dull fire burned in his chest, warning against \\n\\nthat had come before. \\n\\nA flock of the blue-headed goat-mutants scattered at the \\n\\napproach of a stranger and fled into straggly mesquite. \\n\\nOddly, the mesa seemed more verdant than the \\n\\nsurrounding desert, although there was no visible supply of \\n\\nmoisture. \\n\\n\"This way, Paulo. To my mansion.\"  \\n\\nThe Old Jew\\'s hovel proved to be a single room, \\n\\nwindowless and stone-walled, its rocks stacked loosely as a \\n\\nThe roof was a flimsy patchwork of poles, most of them \\n\\ncrooked, covered by a heap of brush, thatch, and \\n\\ngoatskins. On a large flat rock, set on a short pillar beside \\n\\nthe door, was a sign painted in Hebrew: \\n\\n****** ****** ** \\n\\nThe size of the sign, and its apparent attempt to advertise, \\n\\nled Abbot Paulo to grin and ask: \"What does it say, \\n\\nBenjamin? Does it attract much trade up here?\" \\n\\n\"Hah– what should it say? It says: Tents Mended Here.\" \\n\\nThe priest snorted his disbelief. \\n\\n\"All right, doubt me. But if you don\\'t believe what\\'s written \\n\\nthere, you can\\'t be expected to believe what\\'s written on \\n\\nthe other side of the sign.\" \\n\\n\"Facing the wall?\"  \\n\\n\"Obviously facing the wall.\"  \\n\\nThe pillar was set close to the threshold, so that only a few \\n\\ninches of clearance existed between the flat rock and the \\n\\nwall of the hovel. Paulo stooped low and squinted into the \\n\\nnarrow space. It took him a while to make it out, but sure \\n\\nenough there was something written on the back of the \\n\\nrock, in smaller letters: \\n\\n*** * ***** * **** *** \\n\\n\"Do you ever turn the rock around?\" \\n\\n\"What does it say back there?\" \\n\\n\"Hmmm-hnnnn!\" the hermit singsonged, refusing to \\n\\nanswer. \"But come on it, you who can\\'t read from the \\n\\nbackside.\" \\n\\n\"There\\'s a wall slightly in the way.\" \\n\\n\"There always was, wasn\\'t there?\" \\n\\nThe priest sighed. \"All right, Benjamin, I know what it was \\n\\nthat you were commanded to write \\'in the entry and on the \\n\\ndoor\\' of your house. But only you would think of turning it \\n\\nface down.\" \\n\\n\"Face inward,\" corrected the hermit. \"As long as there are \\n\\ntents to be mended in Israel– but let\\'s not begin teasing \\n\\neach other until you\\'ve rested. I\\'ll get you some milk, and \\n\\nyou tell me about this visitor that\\'s worrying you.\" \\n\\n\"There\\'s wine in my bag if you\\'d like some,\" said the \\n\\nabbot, falling with relief onto a mound of skins. \"But I\\'d \\n\\nrather not talk about Thon Taddeo.\" \\n\\n\"Oh? That one.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'ve heard of Thon Taddeo? Tell me, how is it you\\'ve \\n\\nalways managed to know everything and everybody \\n\\nwithout stirring from this hill?\" \\n\\n\"One hears, one sees,\" the hermit said cryptically. \\n\\n\"Tell me, what do you think of him?\" \\n\\n\"I haven\\'t seen him. But I suppose he will be a pain. A  \\n\\nbirthpain, perhaps, but a pain.\" \\n\\n\"Birth-pain? You really believe we\\'re going to have a new \\n\\nRenaissance, as some say?\" \\n\\n\"Hmmm-hnnn.\" \\n\\n\"Stop smirking mysteriously, Old Jew, and tell me your \\n\\nopinion. You\\'re bound to have one. You always do. Why is \\n\\nyour confidence so hard to get? Aren\\'t we friends?\" \\n\\n\"On some grounds, on some grounds. But we have our \\n\\ndifferences, you and I.\" \\n\\n\"What have our differences got to do with Thon Taddeo \\n\\nand a Renaissance we\\'d both like to see? Thon Taddeo is a \\n\\nsecular scholar, and rather remote from our differences.\" \\n\\nBenjamin shrugged eloquently. \"Difference, secular \\n\\nscholars,\" he echoed, tossing out the words like discarded \\n\\napple pits. \"I have been called a \\'secular scholar\\' at various \\n\\ntimes by certain people, and sometimes I\\'ve been staked, \\n\\nstoned, and burned for it.\" \\n\\n\"Why, you never– \" The priest stopped, frowning sharply.  \\n\\nThat madness again. Benjamin was peering at him \\n\\nsuspiciously, and his smile had gone cold. Now, thought \\n\\nwhatever formless \"Them\" it was that drove him here to \\n\\nsolitude. Staked, stoned, and burned? Or did his \"I\" mean \\n\\n\"We\" as in \"I, my people\"? \\n\\n\"Benjamin– I am Paulo. Torquemada is dead. I was born \\n\\nseventy-odd years ago, and pretty soon I\\'ll die. I have \\n\\nloved you, old man, and when you look at me, I wish you \\n\\nwould see Paulo of Pecos and no other.\" \\n\\nBenjamin wavered for a moment. His eyes became moist. \\n\\n\"I sometimes– forget– \" \\n\\n\"And sometimes you forget that Benjamin is only \\n\\nBenjamin, and not all of Israel.\" \\n\\n\"Never!\" snapped the hermit, eyes blazing again. \"For \\n\\nthirty-two centuries, I– \" He stopped and closed his mouth \\n\\ntightly. \\n\\n\"Why?\" the abbot whispered almost in awe. \"Why do you \\n\\ntake the burden of a people and its past upon yourself \\n\\nalone?\" \\n\\nThe hermit\\'s eyes flared a brief warning, but he swallowed \\n\\na throaty sound and lowered his face into his hands. \"You \\n\\nfish in dark waters.\" \\n\\n\"Forgive me.\" \\n\\n\"The burden– it was pressed upon me by others.\" He \\n\\nlooked up slowly. \"Should I refuse to take it?\" \\n\\nThe priest sucked in his breath. For a time there was no \\n\\nsound in the shanty but the sound of the wind. There was \\n\\na touch of divinity in this madness! Dom Paulo thought. \\n\\nThe Jewish community was thinly scattered in these times. \\n\\nBenjamin had perhaps outlived his children, or somehow \\n\\nbecome an outcast. Such an old Israelite might wander for \\n\\nin his loneliness he had acquired the silent conviction that \\n\\nhe was the last, the one, the only. And, being the last, he \\n\\nceased to be Benjamin, becoming Israel. And upon his \\n\\nheart had settled the history of five thousand years, no \\n\\nlonger remote, but become as the history of his own \\n\\nlifetime. His \"I\" was the converse of the imperial \"We.\" \\n\\nBut I, too, am a member of a oneness, thought Doni Paulo, \\n\\na part of a congregation and a continuity. Mine, too, have \\n\\nbeen despised by the world. Yet for me the distinction \\n\\nbetween self and nation is clear. For you, old friend, it has \\n\\nsomehow become obscure. A burden pressed upon you by \\n\\nothers? And you accepted it? What must it weigh? What \\n\\nwould it weigh for me? He set his shoulders under it and \\n\\ntried to heave, testing the bulk of it: I am a Christian \\n\\nGod for the actions and deeds of every monk and priest \\n\\nwho has breathed and walked the earth since Christ, as \\n\\nwell as for the acts of my own. \\n\\nHe shuddered and began shaking his head. \\n\\nfor any man to bear, save Christ alone. To be cursed for a \\n\\nfaith was burden enough. To bear the curses was possible, \\n\\nbut then– to accept the illogic behind the curses, the illogic \\n\\nwhich called one to task not only for himself but also for \\n\\nevery member of his race or faith, for their actions as well \\n\\nas one\\'s own? To accept that too?– as Benjamin was \\n\\ntrying to do? \\n\\nNo, no. \\n\\nAnd yet, Dom Paulo\\'s own Faith told him that the burden  \\n\\nwas there, had been there since Adam\\'s time– and the \\n\\nburden imposed by a fiend crying in mockery, \"Man!\" at \\n\\nsince the beginning; a burden impressed upon every \\n\\ngeneration before the opening of the womb, the burden of \\n\\nthe guilt of original sin. Let the fool dispute it. The same \\n\\nfool with great delight accepted the other inheritance– the \\n\\ninheritance of ancestral glory, virtue, triumph, and dignity \\n\\nwhich rendered him \"courageous and noble by reason of \\n\\nbirthright,\" without protesting that he personally had done \\n\\nnothing to earn that inheritance beyond being born of the \\n\\nrace of Man. The protest was reserved for the inherited \\n\\nburden which rendered him \"guilty and outcast by reason \\n\\nof birthright,\" and against that verdict he strained to close \\n\\nhis ears. The burden, indeed, was hard. His own Faith told \\n\\nhim, too, that the burden had been lifted from him by the \\n\\nOne whose image hung from a cross above the altars, \\n\\nalthough the burden\\'s imprint still was there. The imprint \\n\\nwas an easier yoke, compared to the full weight of the \\n\\noriginal curse. He could not bring himself to say it to the \\n\\nold man, since the old man already knew he believed it. \\n\\nBenjamin was looking for Another. And the last old Hebrew \\n\\nsat alone on a mountain and did penance for Israel and \\n\\nwaited for a Messiah, and waited, and waited, and– \"God \\n\\nbless you for a brave fool. Even a wise fool.\" \\n\\n\"Hmmm-hnnn! Wise fool!\" mimicked the hermit. \"But you \\n\\nalways did specialize in paradox and mystery, didn\\'t you, \\n\\nPaulo? If a thing can\\'t be in contradiction to itself, then it \\n\\ndoesn\\'t even interest you, does it? You have to find \\n\\nThreeness in Unity, life in death, wisdom in folly. \\n\\nOtherwise it might make too much common sense.\" \\n\\nyou can carry it alone is folly.\" \\n\\n\"Not madness?\" \\n\\n\"A little, perhaps. But a brave madness.\" \\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll tell you a small secret. I\\'ve known all along that I \\n\\ncan\\'t carry it, ever since He called me forth again. But are \\n\\nwe talking about the same thing?\" \\n\\nThe priest shrugged. \"You would call it the burden of being \\n\\nChosen. I would call it the burden of Original Guilt. In \\n\\neither case, the implied responsibility is the same, \\n\\nalthough we might tell different versions of it, and disagree \\n\\nviolently in words about what we mean in words by \\n\\nsomething that isn\\'t really meant in words at all– since it\\'s \\n\\nsomething that\\'s meant in the dead silence of a heart.\" \\n\\nBenjamin chuckled. \"Well, I\\'m glad to hear you admit it, \\n\\nfinally, even if all you say is that you\\'ve never really said \\n\\nanything.\" \\n\\n\"Stop cackling, you reprobate.\" \\n\\n\"But you\\'ve always used words so wordily in crafty defense \\n\\nof your Trinity, although He never needed such defense \\n\\nbefore you got Him from me as a Unity. Eh?\" \\n\\nThe priest reddened but said nothing. \\n\\n\"There!\" Benjamin yelped, bouncing up and down. \"I made \\n\\nyou want to argue for once! Ha! But never mind. I use \\n\\nquite a few words myself, but I\\'m never quite sure He and \\n\\nI mean the same thing either. I suppose you can\\'t be \\n\\nblamed; it must be more confusing with Three than with \\n\\nOne.\" \\n\\n\"Blasphemous old cactus! I really wanted your opinion of \\n\\nThon Taddeo and whatever\\'s brewing.\" \\n\\n\"Why seek the opinion of a poor old anchorite?\" \\n\\n\"Because, Benjamin Eleazar bar Joshua, if all these years \\n\\nof waiting for One-Who-Isn\\'t-Coming haven\\'t taught you \\n\\nwisdom, at least they\\'ve made you shrewd.\" \\n\\nThe Old Jew closed his eyes, lifted his face ceilingward, \\n\\nand smiled cunningly. \"Insult me,\" he said in mocking \\n\\ntones, \"rail at me, bait me, persecute me– but do you \\n\\nknow what I\\'ll say?\" \\n\\n\"You\\'ll say, \\'Hmmm-hnnn!\\'\" \\n\\n\"No! I\\'ll say He\\'s already here. I caught a glimpse of Him \\n\\nonce.\" \\n\\n\"What? Who are you talking about? Thon Taddeo?\" \\n\\n\"No! Moreover, I do not care to prophesy, unless you tell \\n\\nme what\\'s really bothering you, Paulo.\" \\n\\n\"Well, it all started with Brother Kornhoer\\'s lamp.\" \\n\\n\"Lamp? Oh, yes, the Poet mentioned it. He prophesied it \\n\\nwouldn\\'t work.\" \\n\\n\"The Poet was wrong, as usual. So they tell me. I didn\\'t \\n\\nwatch the trial.\" \\n\\n\"It worked then? Splendid. And that started what?\"  \\n\\n\"Me wondering. How close are we to the brink of \\n\\nthe basement. Do you realize how much things have \\n\\nchanged in the past two centuries?\" \\n\\nSoon, the priest spoke at length of his fears, while the \\n\\nhermit, mender of tents, listened patiently until the sun \\n\\npaint glowing shafts in the dusty air. \\n\\n\"Since the death of the last civilization, the Memorabilia \\n\\nhas been our special province, Benjamin. And we\\'ve kept \\n\\nit. But now? I sense the predicament of the shoemaker \\n\\nwho tries to sell shoes in a village of shoemakers.\" \\n\\nThe hermit smiled. \"It could be done, if he manufactures a \\n\\nspecial and superior type of shoe.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid the secular scholars are already beginning to \\n\\nlay claim to such a method.\" \\n\\n\"Then go out of the shoemaking business, before you are \\n\\nruined.\" \\n\\n\"A possibility,\" the abbot admitted. \"It\\'s unpleasant to  \\n\\nthink of it however. For twelve centuries, we\\'ve been one \\n\\nlittle island in a very dark ocean. Keeping the Memorabilia \\n\\nhas been a thankless task, but a hallowed one, we think. \\n\\nIt\\'s only our worldly job, but we\\'ve always been \\n\\nbookleggers and memorizers, and it\\'s hard to think that \\n\\nthe job\\'s soon to be finished– soon to become \\n\\nunnecessary. I can\\'t believe that somehow.\" \\n\\n\"So you try to best the other \\'shoemakers\\' by building \\n\\nstrange contraptions in your basement?\" \\n\\n\"I must admit, it looks that way– \" \\n\\n\"What will you do next to keep ahead of the seculars? \\n\\nBuild a flying machine? Or revive the Machina analytica? \\n\\nOr perhaps step over their heads and resort to \\n\\nmetaphysics?\" \\n\\n\"You shame me, Old Jew. You know we are monks of \\n\\nChrist first, and such things are for others to do.\" \\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t shaming you. I see nothing inconsistent in monks \\n\\nof Christ building a flying machine, although it would be \\n\\nmore like them to build a praying machine.\" \\n\\n\"Wretch! I do my Order a disservice by sharing a  \\n\\nconfidence with you!\" \\n\\nBenjamin smirked. \"I have no sympathy for you. The \\n\\nbooks you stored away may be hoary with age, but they \\n\\nwere written by children of the world, and they\\'ll be taken \\n\\nfrom you by children of the world, and you had no \\n\\nbusiness meddling with them in the first place.\" \\n\\n\"Ah, now you care to prophesy!\" \\n\\n\"Not at all. \\'Soon the sun will set\\'– is that prophecy? No, \\n\\nit\\'s merely an assertion of faith in the consistency of \\n\\nevents. The children of the world are consistent too– so I \\n\\nsay they will soak up everything you can offer, take your \\n\\njob away from you, and then denounce you as a decrepit \\n\\nwreck. Finally, they\\'ll ignore you entirely. It\\'s your own \\n\\nfault. The Book I gave you should have been enough for \\n\\nyou. Now you\\'ll just have to take the consequences for \\n\\nyour meddling.\" \\n\\nHe had spoken flippantly, but his prediction seemed \\n\\nuncomfortably close to Dom Paulo\\'s fears. The priest\\'s \\n\\ncountenance saddened. \\n\\n\"Pay me no mind,\" said the hermit. \"I\\'ll not venture to  \\n\\nsoothsay before I\\'ve seen this contraption of yours, or \\n\\ntaken a look at this Thon Taddeo– who begins to interest \\n\\nme, by the way. Wait until I\\'ve examined the entrails of \\n\\nthe new era in better detail, if you expect advice from me.\" \\n\\n\"Well, you won\\'t see the lamp because you never come to \\n\\nthe abbey.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s your abominable cooking I object to.\" \\n\\n\"And you won\\'t see Thon Taddeo because he comes from \\n\\nthe other direction. If you wait to examine the entrails of \\n\\nan era until after it\\'s born, it\\'s too late to prophesy its \\n\\nbirth.\" \\n\\n\"Nonsense. Probing the womb of the future is bad for the \\n\\nchild. I shall wait– and then I shall prophesy that it was \\n\\nborn and that it wasn\\'t what I\\'m waiting for.\" \\n\\n\"What a cheerful outlook! So what are you looking for?\" \\n\\n\"Someone who shouted at me once.\" \\n\\n\"Shouted?\" \\n\\n\"\\'Come forth!\\'\"  \\n\\n\"What rot!\" \\n\\n\"Hmmm-hnnn! To tell you the truth, I don\\'t much expect \\n\\nHim to come, but I was told to wait, and– \" he shrugged \"– \\n\\nI wait.\" After a moment his twinkling eyes narrowed to \\n\\nslits, and he leaned forward with sudden eagerness. \\n\\n\"Paulo, bring this Thon Taddeo past the foot of the mesa.\" \\n\\nThe abbot recoiled in mock horror. \"Accoster of pilgrims! \\n\\nMolester of novices! I shall send you the Poet-sirrah!– and \\n\\nmay he descend upon you and rest forever. Bring the thon \\n\\npast your lair! What an outrage.\" \\n\\nBenjamin shrugged again. \"Very well. Forget that I asked \\n\\nit. But let\\'s hope this thon will be on our side, and not with \\n\\nthe others this time.\" \\n\\n\"Others, Benjamin?\" \\n\\n\"Manasses, Cyrus, Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, Caesar, \\n\\nHannegan the Second– need I go on? Samuel warned us \\n\\nagainst them, then gave us one. When they have a few \\n\\nwise men shackled nearby to counsel them, they become \\n\\nmore dangerous than ever. That\\'s all the advice I\\'ll give \\n\\nyou.\" \\n\\n\"Well, Benjamin, I\\'ve had enough of you now to last me \\n\\nanother five years, so– \" \\n\\n\"Insult me, rail at me, bait me– \" \\n\\n\"Stop it. I\\'m leaving, old man. It\\'s late.\" \\n\\n\"So? And how is the ecclesiastical belly fixed for the ride?\" \\n\\n\"My stomach– ?\" Dom Paulo paused to explore, found \\n\\nhimself more comfortable than at any time in recent \\n\\nweeks. \"It\\'s a mess, of course,\" he complained. \"How else \\n\\nwould it be after listening to you?\" \\n\\n\"True– El Shaddai is merciful, but He is also just.\" \\n\\n\"Godspeed, old man. After Brother Kornhoer reinvents the \\n\\nflying machine, I\\'ll send up some novices to drop rocks on \\n\\nyou.\" \\n\\nThey embraced affectionately. The Old Jew led him to the \\n\\nedge of the mesa. Benjamin stood wrapped in a prayer \\n\\nshawl, its fine fabric contrasting oddly with the rough \\n\\nburlap of his loincloth, while the abbot climbed down to the \\n\\ntrail and rode back toward the abbey. Dom Paulo could still \\n\\nsee him standing there at sundown, his spindly figure \\n\\nsilhouetted against the twilight sky as he bowed and \\n\\nmunched a prayer over the desert. \\n\\n\"Memento, Domine, omnium famulorum tuorum,\" the \\n\\nabbot whispered in response, adding: \"And may he finally \\n\\nwin the Poet\\'s eyeball at mumbly-peg. Amen.\" \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Seventeen  \\n\\n\"I can tell you definitely: There will be war,\" said the \\n\\nmessenger from New Rome. \"All Laredo\\'s forces are \\n\\ncommitted to the Plains. Mad Bear has broken camp. \\n\\nThere\\'s a running cavalry battle, nomad style, all over the \\n\\nPlains. But the State of Chihuahua is threatening Laredo \\n\\nfrom the south. So Hannegan is getting ready to send \\n\\nTexarkana forces to the Rio Grande– to help \\'defend\\' the \\n\\nfrontier. With the Laredans\\' full approval, of course.\" \\n\\n\"King Goraldi is a doddering fool!\" said Dom Paulo. \"Wasn\\'t \\n\\nhe warned against Hannegan\\'s treachery?\" \\n\\nThe messenger smiled. \"The Vatican diplomatic service \\n\\nalways respects state secrets if we happen to learn them. \\n\\nLest we be accused of espionage, we are always careful \\n\\nabout– \" \\n\\n\"Was he warned?\" the abbot demanded again. \\n\\n\"Of course. Goraldi said the papal legate was lying to him; \\n\\nhe accused the Church of fomenting dissension among the \\n\\nallies of the Holy Scourge, in an attempt to promote the \\n\\nPope\\'s temporal power. The idiot even told Hannegan \\n\\nabout the legate\\'s warning.\"  \\n\\nDom Paulo winced and whistled. \"So Hannegan did what?\" \\n\\nThe messenger hesitated. \"I suppose I can tell you: \\n\\nMonsignor Apollo is under arrest. Hannegan ordered his \\n\\ndiplomatic files seized. There\\'s talk in New Rome of placing \\n\\nthe whole realm of Texarkana under interdict. Of course, \\n\\nHannegan has already incurred ipso facto \\n\\nexcommunication, but that doesn\\'t seem to bother many \\n\\nTexarkanans. As you surely know, the population is about \\n\\neighty per cent cultist anyhow, and the Catholicism of the \\n\\nruling class has always been a thin veneer.\" \\n\\n\"So now Marcus,\" the abbot murmured sadly. \"And what of \\n\\nThon Taddeo?\" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t quite see how he expects to get across the Plains \\n\\nwithout picking up a few musket-ball holes just now. It \\n\\nseems clear why he hadn\\'t wanted to make the trip. But I \\n\\nknow nothing about his progress, Father Abbot.\" \\n\\nDom Paulo\\'s frown was pained. \"If our refusal to send the \\n\\nmaterial to his university leads to his being killed– \" \\n\\n\"Don\\'t trouble your conscience about that, Father Abbot.  \\n\\nHannegan looks out for his own. I don\\'t know how, but I\\'m \\n\\nsure the thon will get here.\" \\n\\n\"The world could ill afford to lose him, I hear. Well– But \\n\\nus? We\\'re in the empire of Denver, and I can\\'t see how \\n\\nthis region is affected.\" \\n\\n\"Ah, but I\\'ve told you only the beginning. Hannegan hopes \\n\\nto unite the continent eventually. After Laredo\\'s firmly \\n\\nleashed, he will have broken the encirclement that\\'s kept \\n\\nhim in check. Then the next move will be against Denver.\" \\n\\n\"But wouldn\\'t that involve supply lines across nomad \\n\\ncountry? It seems impossible.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s extremely difficult, and that\\'s what makes the next \\n\\nmove certain. The Plains form a natural geographical \\n\\nbarrier. If they were depopulated, Hannegan might regard \\n\\nhis western frontier as secure as it stands. But the nomads \\n\\nhave made it necessary for all states adjoining the Plains \\n\\nto tie up permanent military forces around the nomad \\n\\nterritory for containment. The only way to subdue the \\n\\nPlains is to control both fertile strips, to the east and to the \\n\\nwest.\"  \\n\\n\"But even so,\" the abbot wondered, \"the nomads– \" \\n\\n\"Hannegan\\'s plan for them is devilish. Mad Bear\\'s warriors \\n\\ncan easily cope with Laredo\\'s cavalry, but what they can\\'t \\n\\ncope with is a cattle plague. The Plains tribes don\\'t know it \\n\\nyet, but when Laredo set out to punish the nomads for \\n\\nborder raiding, the Laredans drove several hundred head \\n\\nof diseased cattle ahead to mingle with the nomads\\' herds. \\n\\nIt was Hannegan\\'s idea. The result will be famine, and \\n\\nthen it will be easy to set tribe against tribe. We don\\'t, of \\n\\ncourse, know all the details, but the goal is a nomad legion \\n\\nunder a puppet chieftain, armed by Texarkana, loyal to \\n\\nHannegan, ready to sweep west to the mountains. If it \\n\\ncomes to pass, this region will get the first breakers.\" \\n\\n\"But why? Surely Hannegan doesn\\'t expect the barbarians \\n\\nto be dependable troops, or capable of holding an empire \\n\\nonce they finish mutilating it!\" \\n\\n\"No, m\\'Lord. But the nomad tribes will be disrupted, \\n\\nDenver will be shattered. Then Hannegan can pick up the \\n\\npieces.\" \\n\\n\"To do what with them? It couldn\\'t be a very rich empire.\"  \\n\\n\"No, but secure on all flanks. He might then be in a better \\n\\nposition to strike east or northeast. Of course, before it \\n\\ncomes to that, his plans may collapse. But whether they \\n\\ncollapse or not, this region may well be in danger of being \\n\\noverrun in the not-too-distant future. Steps should be \\n\\ntaken to secure the abbey within the next few months. I \\n\\nhave instructions to discuss with you the problem of \\n\\nkeeping the Memorabilia safe.\" \\n\\ntwelve centuries, a little hope had come into the world– \\n\\nand then came an illiterate prince to ride roughshod over it \\n\\nwith a barbarian horde and. . . \\n\\nHis fist exploded onto the desktop. \"We kept them outside \\n\\nour walls for a thousand years,\" he growled, \"and we can \\n\\nkeep them out for another thousand. This abbey was \\n\\nunder siege three times during the Bayring influx, and \\n\\nonce again during the Vissarionist schism. We\\'ll keep the \\n\\nbooks safe. We\\'ve kept them that way for quite some \\n\\ntime.\" \\n\\n\"But there is an added hazard these days, m\\'Lord.\"  \\n\\n\"What may that be?\"  \\n\\n\"A bountiful supply of gunpowder and grapeshot.\"  \\n\\nthere was no word of the party from Texarkana. Private \\n\\nvotive masses for pilgrims and travelers were beginning to \\n\\nbe offered by the abbey\\'s priests. Dom Paulo had ceased \\n\\ntaking even a light breakfast, and it was whispered that he \\n\\nwas doing penance for having invited the scholar at all, in \\n\\nview of the present danger on the Plains. \\n\\nThe watchtowers remained constantly manned. The abbot \\n\\nhimself frequently climbed the wall to peer eastward. \\n\\nShortly before Vespers on the Feast of Saint Bernard, a \\n\\nnovice reported seeing a thin and distant dust trail, but \\n\\ndarkness was coming on, and no one else had been able to \\n\\nmake it out. Soon, Compline and the Salve Regina were \\n\\nsung, but still no one appeared at the gates. \\n\\n\"It might have been their advance scout,\" suggested Prior \\n\\nGault. \\n\\n\"It might have been Brother Watchman\\'s imagination,\" \\n\\ncountered Dom Paulo. \\n\\n\"But if they\\'ve camped just ten miles or so down the way– \\n\\n\" \\n\\n\"We\\'d see their fire from the tower. It\\'s a clear night.\" \\n\\n\"Still, Domne, after the moon rises, we could send a rider– \\n\\n\" \\n\\n\"Oh, no. That\\'s a good way to get shot by mistake. If it\\'s \\n\\nreally them, they\\'ve probably kept their fingers on their \\n\\ntriggers for the whole trip, especially at night. It can wait \\n\\nuntil dawn.\" \\n\\nIt was late the following morning when the expected party \\n\\nof horsemen appeared out of the east. From the top of the \\n\\nwall Dom Paulo blinked and squinted across the hot and \\n\\ndry terrain, trying to focus myopic eyes on the distance. \\n\\nDust from the horses\\' hooves was drifting away to the \\n\\nnorth. The party had stopped for a parley. \\n\\n\"I seem to be seeing twenty or thirty of them,\" the abbot \\n\\ncomplained, rubbing his eyes in annoyance. \"Are there \\n\\nreally so many?\"  \\n\\n\"Approximately,\" said Gault.  \\n\\n\"How will we ever take care of them all?\"  \\n\\n\"I don\\'t think we\\'ll be taking care of the ones with the  \\n\\nwolfskins, m\\'Lord Abbot,\" the younger priest said stiffly.  \\n\\n\"Wolf skins?\"  \\n\\n\"Nomads, m\\'Lord.\"  \\n\\n\"Man the walls! Close the gates! Let down the shield!  \\n\\nBreak out the– \"  \\n\\n\"Wait, they\\'re not all nomads, Domne.\"  \\n\\n\"Oh?\" Dom Paulo turned to peer again.  \\n\\nThe parley was being ended. Men waved; the group split in  \\n\\ntwo. The larger party galloped back toward the east. The \\n\\nremaining horsemen watched briefly, then reined around \\n\\nand trotted toward the abbey. \\n\\n\"Six or seven of them– some in uniform,\" the abbot \\n\\nmurmured as they drew closer. \\n\\n\"The thon and his party, I\\'m sure.\" \\n\\n\"But with nomads? It\\'s a good thing I didn\\'t let you send a \\n\\nrider out last night. What were they doing with nomads?\" \\n\\n\"It appeared that they came as guides,\" Father Gault said \\n\\ndarkly. \\n\\n\"How neighborly of the lion to lie down with the lamb!\" \\n\\nThe riders approached the gates. Dom Paulo swallowed \\n\\ndryness. \"Well, we\\'d better go welcome them, Father,\" he \\n\\nsighed. \\n\\nBy the time the priests had descended from the wall, the \\n\\ntravelers had reined up just outside the courtyard. A \\n\\nhorseman detached himself from the others, trotted \\n\\nforward, dismounted, and presented his papers. \\n\\n\"Dom Paulo of Pecos, Abbas?\" \\n\\nThe abbot bowed. \"Tibi adsum. Welcome in the name of  \\n\\nSaint Leibowitz, Thon Taddeo. Welcome in the name of his \\n\\nyou to come. Be at home. We serve you.\" The words were \\n\\nheart-felt; the words had been saved for many years while \\n\\nawaiting this moment. Hearing a muttered monosyllable in \\n\\nreply, Dom Paulo looked up slowly. \\n\\nFor a moment his glance locked with the scholar\\'s. He felt \\n\\nthe warmth quickly fade. Those icy eyes– cold and \\n\\nsearching gray. Skeptical, hungry, and proud. They studied \\n\\nhim as one might study a lifeless curio. \\n\\nThat this moment might be as a bridge across a gulf of \\n\\ntwelve centuries, Paulo had fervently prayed– prayed too \\n\\nthat through him the last martyred scientist of that earlier \\n\\nage would clasp hands with tomorrow. There was indeed a \\n\\ngulf; that much was plain. The abbot felt suddenly that he \\n\\nbelonged not to this age at all, that he had been left \\n\\nstranded somewhere on a sandbar in Time\\'s river, and that \\n\\nthere wasn\\'t really ever a bridge at all. \\n\\n\"Come,\" he said gently. \"Brother Visclair will attend to your \\n\\nhorses.\" \\n\\nWhen he had seen the guests installed in their lodgings \\n\\nand had retired to the privacy of his study, the smile on \\n\\nthe face of the wooden saint reminded him unaccountably \\n\\nof the smirk of old Benjamin Eleazar, saying, \"The children \\n\\nof this world are consistent too.\" \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Eighteen  \\n\\n\"Now even as in the time of Job,\" Brother Reader began \\n\\nfrom the refectory lectern: \\n\\n\"When the Sons of God came to stand before the Lord, \\n\\nSatan also was present among them. \\n\\n\"And the Lord said to him: \"Whence comest thou, Satan?\\' \\n\\n\"And Satan answering said, as of old: \\'I have gone round \\n\\nabout the earth, and have walked through it.\\' \\n\\n\"And the Lord said to him: \\'Hast thou considered that \\n\\nsimple and upright prince, my servant Name, hating evil \\n\\nand loving peace?\\' \\n\\n\"And Satan answering said: \\'Doth Name fear God in vain? \\n\\nFor hast Thou not blessed his land with great wealth and \\n\\nmade him mighty among the nations? But stretch forth \\n\\nThy hand a little and decrease what he hath, and let his \\n\\nenemy be strengthened; then see if he blasphemeth Thee \\n\\nnot to Thy face.\\' \\n\\n\"And the Lord said to Satan: \\'Behold what he hath, and  \\n\\nlessen it. See thou to it.\\' \\n\\n\"And Satan went forth from the presence of God and \\n\\nreturned into the world. \\n\\n\"Now the Prince Name was not as Holy Job, for when his \\n\\nland was afflicted with trouble and his people less rich than \\n\\nbefore, when he saw his enemy become mightier, he grew \\n\\nfearful and ceased to trust in God, thinking unto himself: I \\n\\nmust strike before the enemy overwhelmeth me without \\n\\ntaking his sword in hand. \\n\\n\"And so it was in those days,\" said Brother Reader: \\n\\n\"that the princes of Earth had hardened their hearts \\n\\nagainst the Law of the Lord, and of their pride there was \\n\\nwas better for all to be destroyed than for the will of other \\n\\nprinces to prevail over his. For the mighty of the Earth did \\n\\ncontend among themselves for supreme power over all; by \\n\\nstealth, treachery, and deceit they did seek to rule, and of  \\n\\nwar they feared greatly and did tremble; for the Lord God \\n\\nhad suffered the wise men of those times to learn the \\n\\nmeans by which the world itself might be destroyed, and \\n\\ninto their hands was given the sword of the Archangel \\n\\nwherewith Lucifer had been cast down, that men and \\n\\nprinces might fear God and humble themselves before the \\n\\nMost High. But they were not humbled. \\n\\n\"And Satan spoke unto a certain prince, saying: \\'Fear not \\n\\nto use the sword, for the wise men have deceived you in \\n\\nsaying that the world would be destroyed thereby. Listen \\n\\nnot to the counsel of weaklings, for they fear you \\n\\nexceedingly, and they serve your enemies by staying your \\n\\nhand against them. Strike, and know that you shall be king \\n\\nover all.\\' \\n\\n\"And the prince did heed the word of Satan, and he \\n\\nsummoned all of the wise men of that realm and called \\n\\nupon them to give him counsel as to the ways in which the \\n\\nenemy might be destroyed without bringing down the \\n\\nwrath upon his own kingdom. But most of the wise men \\n\\nsaid, \\'Lord, it is not possible, for your enemies also have \\n\\nthe sword which we have given you, and the fieriness of it \\n\\nis as the flame of Hell and as the fury of the sunstar from \\n\\nwhence it was kindled.\\'  \\n\\n\"\\'Then thou shalt make me yet another which is yet seven \\n\\ntimes hotter than Hell itself,\\' commanded the prince, \\n\\nwhose arrogance had come to surpass that of Pharaoh. \\n\\n\"And many of them said: \\'Nay, Lord, ask not this thing of \\n\\nus; for even the smoke of such a fire, if we were to kindle \\n\\nit for thee, would cause many to perish.\\' \\n\\n\"Now the prince was angry because of their answer, and \\n\\nhe suspected them of betraying him, and he sent his spies \\n\\namong them to tempt them and to challenge them; \\n\\nwhereupon the wise men became afraid. Some among \\n\\nthem changed their answers, that his wrath be not invoked \\n\\nagainst them. Three times he asked them, and three times \\n\\nthey answered: \\'Nay, Lord, even your own people will \\n\\nperish if you do this thing.\\' But one of the magi was like \\n\\nunto Judas Iscariot, and his testimony was crafty, and \\n\\nhaving betrayed his brothers, he lied to all the people, \\n\\nadvising them not to fear the demon Fallout. The prince \\n\\nheeded this false wise man, whose name was Blackeneth, \\n\\nand he caused spies to accuse many of the magi before \\n\\nthe people. Being afraid, the less wise among the magi \\n\\ncounseled the prince according to his pleasure, saying: \\n\\n\\'The weapons may be used, only do not exceed \\n\\nsuch-and-such a limit, or all will surely perish.\\' \\n\\n\"And the prince smote the cities of his enemies with the \\n\\nnew fire, and for three days and nights did his great \\n\\ncatapults and metal birds rain wrath upon them. Over each \\n\\ncity a sun appeared and was brighter than the sun of \\n\\nheaven, and immediately that city withered and melted as \\n\\nwax under the torch, and the people thereof did stop in the \\n\\nstreets and their skins smoked and they became as fagots \\n\\nthrown on the coals. And when the fury of the sun had \\n\\nfaded, the city was in flames; and a great thunder came \\n\\nout of the sky, like the great battering-ram PIK-A-DON, to \\n\\ncrush it utterly. Poisonous fumes fell over all the land, and \\n\\nthe land was aglow by night with the afterfire and the \\n\\ncurse of the afterfire which caused a scurf on the skin and \\n\\nmade the hair to fall and the blood to die in the veins. \\n\\n\"And a great stink went up from Earth even unto Heaven. \\n\\nLike unto Sodom and Gomorrah was the Earth and the \\n\\nruins thereof, even in the land of that certain prince, for \\n\\nhis enemies did not withhold their vengeance, sending fire \\n\\nin turn to engulf his cities as their own. The stink of the \\n\\ncarnage was exceedingly offensive to the Lord, Who spoke \\n\\nunto the prince, Name, saying: \\'WHAT BURNT OFFERING \\n\\nIS THIS THAT YOU HAVE PREPARED BEFORE ME? WHAT IS \\n\\nTHIS SAVOR THAT ARISES FROM THE PLACE OF \\n\\nHOLOCAUST? HAVE YOU MADE ME A HOLOCAUST OF \\n\\nSHEEP OR GOATS, OR OFFERED A CALF UNTO GOD?\\' \\n\\n\"But the prince answered him not, and God said: \\'YOU \\n\\nHAVE MADE ME A HOLOCAUST OF MY SONS.\\' \\n\\n\"And the Lord slew him together with Blackeneth, the \\n\\nbetrayer, and there was pestilence in the Earth, and \\n\\nmadness was upon mankind, who stoned the wise together \\n\\nwith the powerful, those who remained. \\n\\n\"But there was in that time a man whose name was \\n\\nLeibowitz, who, in his youth like the holy Augustine, had \\n\\nloved the wisdom of the world more than the wisdom of \\n\\nGod. But now seeing that great knowledge, while good, \\n\\ncrying:\" \\n\\nThe abbot rapped sharply on the table and the monk who \\n\\nhad been reading the ancient account was immediately \\n\\nsilent. \\n\\nsmiling tightly at the abbot across the study. \\n\\n\"Oh, there are several versions. They differ in minor \\n\\ndetails. No one is certain which nation launched the first \\n\\nattack– not that it matters any more. The text Brother \\n\\nReader was just reading was written a few decades after \\n\\nthe death of Saint Leibowitz– probably one of the first \\n\\naccounts– after it became safe to write again. The author \\n\\nwas a young monk who had not lived through the \\n\\ndestruction himself; he got it second hand from Saint \\n\\nLeibowitz\\' followers, the original memorizers and \\n\\nbookleggers, and he had a liking for scriptural mimicry. I \\n\\nDeluge exists anywhere. Once it started, it was apparently \\n\\ntoo immense for any one person to see the whole picture.\" \\n\\n\"In what land was this prince called Name, and this man \\n\\nBlackeneth?\" \\n\\nAbbot Paulo shook his head. \"Not even the author of that \\n\\naccount was certain. We\\'ve pieced enough together since \\n\\nthat was written to know that even some of the lesser \\n\\nrulers of that time had got their hands on such weapons \\n\\nbefore the holocaust came. The situation he described \\n\\nprevailed in more than one nation. Name and Blackeneth \\n\\nwere probably Legion.\" \\n\\n\"Of course I\\'ve heard similar legends. It\\'s obvious that \\n\\nsomething rather hideous came to pass,\" the thon stated; \\n\\nand then abruptly: \"But when may I begin to examine– \\n\\nwhat do you call it?\" \\n\\n\"The Memorabilia.\" \\n\\nthe saint in the corner. \"Would tomorrow be too soon?\" \\n\\n\"You may begin at once, if you like,\" said the abbot. \"Feel \\n\\nfree to come and go as you please.\" \\n\\nThe vaults were dimly filled with candlelight, and only a \\n\\nfew dark-robed scholar-monks moved about in the stalls. \\n\\nBrother Armbruster pored gloomily over his records in a \\n\\npuddle of lamplight in his cubbyhole at the foot of the \\n\\nstone stairway, and one lamp burned in the Moral \\n\\nTheology alcove where a robed figure huddled over ancient \\n\\nmanuscript. It was after Prime, when most of the \\n\\ncommunity labored at their duties about the abbey, in \\n\\nkitchen, classroom, garden, stable, and office, leaving the \\n\\nlibrary nearly empty until late afternoon and time for lectio \\n\\ndevina. This morning, however, the vaults were \\n\\ncomparatively crowded. \\n\\nThree monks stood lounging in the shadows behind the \\n\\nnew machine. They kept their hands tucked in their \\n\\nsleeves and watched a fourth monk who stood at the foot \\n\\nof the stairs. The fourth monk gazed patiently up toward a \\n\\nfifth monk who stood on the landing and watched the \\n\\nentrance to the stairway. \\n\\nBrother Kornhoer had brooded over his apparatus like an \\n\\nanxious parent, but when he could no longer find wires to \\n\\nwiggle and adjustments to make and remake, he retired to \\n\\nthe Natural Theology alcove to read and wait. To speak a \\n\\nsummary of last-minute instructions to his crew would be \\n\\npermissible, but he chose to maintain the hush, and if any \\n\\nthought of the coming moment as a personal climax \\n\\ncrossed his mind as he waited, the monastic inventor\\'s \\n\\nexpression gave no hint of it. Since the abbot himself had \\n\\nnot bothered to watch a demonstration of the machine, \\n\\nBrother Kornhoer betrayed no symptoms of expecting \\n\\napplause from any quarter, and he had even overcome his \\n\\ntendency to glance reproachfully at Dom Paulo. \\n\\nA low hiss from the stairway alerted the basement again, \\n\\nalthough there had been several earlier false alarms. \\n\\nClearly no one had informed the illustrious thon that a \\n\\nmarvelous invention awaited his inspection in the \\n\\nbasement. Clearly, if it had been mentioned to him at all, \\n\\nits importance had been minimized. Obviously, Father \\n\\nAbbot was seeing to it that they all cooled their heels. \\n\\nThese were the wordless significances exchanged by \\n\\nglances among them as they waited. \\n\\nThis time the warning hiss had not been in vain. The monk \\n\\nwho watched from the head of the stairs turned solemnly \\n\\nand bowed toward the fifth monk on the landing below. \\n\\n\"In principio Deus,\" he said softly. \\n\\nThe fifth monk turned and bowed toward the fourth monk \\n\\nat the foot of the stairs. \"Caelum et terram creavit,\" he \\n\\nmurmured in turn. \\n\\nThe fourth monk turned toward the three who lounged \\n\\nbehind the machine. \"Vacuus autem erat mundus,\" he \\n\\nannounced. \\n\\n\"Cum tenebris in super ficie pro fundorum,\" chorused the \\n\\ngroup. \"Ortus est Dei Spiritus supra aquas,\" called Brother \\n\\nKornhoer, returning his book to its shelf with a rattling of \\n\\nchains. \\n\\n\"Gratias Creatori Spiritui,\" responded his entire team. \\n\\n\"Dixitque Deus: \\'FIAT LUX,\\'\" said the inventor in a tone of \\n\\ncommand. \\n\\nThe vigil on the stairs descended to take their posts. Four \\n\\nmonks manned the treadmill. The fifth monk hovered over \\n\\nthe dynamo. The sixth monk climbed the shelf-ladder and \\n\\ntook his seat on the top rung, his head bumping the top of \\n\\nthe archway. He pulled a mask of smoke-blackened oily \\n\\nparchment over his face to protect his eyes, then felt for \\n\\nthe lamp fixture and its thumbscrew, while Brother \\n\\nKomhoer watched him nervously from below. \\n\\n\"Et lux ergo facta est,\" he said when he had found the \\n\\nscrew. \\n\\n\"Lucem esse bonam Deus vidit,\" the inventor called to the \\n\\nfifth monk. \\n\\nThe fifth monk bent over the dynamo with a candle for one \\n\\nlast look at the brush contacts. \"Et secrevit lucem a \\n\\ntenebris,\" he said at last, continuing the lesson. \\n\\n\"Lucem appellavit \\'diem,\\'\" chorused the treadmill team, \"et \\n\\ntenebras \\'noctes.\\'\" Whereupon they set their shoulders to \\n\\nthe turnstile beams. \\n\\nAxles creaked and groaned. The wagon-wheel dynamo \\n\\nbegan to spin, its low whir becoming a moan and then a \\n\\nThe guardian of the dynamo watched anxiously as the \\n\\nspokes blurred with speed and became a film. \"Vespere \\n\\noccaso,\" he began, then paused to lick two fingers and \\n\\ntouch them to the contacts. A spark snapped. \\n\\n\"Lucifer!\" he yelped, leaping back, then finished lamely: \\n\\n\"ortus est et primo die.\" \\n\\n\"CONTACT!\" said Brother Kornhoer, as Dom Paulo, Thon \\n\\nTaddeo and his clerk descended the stairs. \\n\\nThe monk on the ladder struck the arc. A sharp spffft!– \\n\\nand blinding light flooded the vaults with a brilliance that \\n\\nhad not been seen in twelve centuries. \\n\\nThe group stopped on the stairs. Thou Taddeo gasped an \\n\\noath in his native tongue. He retreated a step. The abbot, \\n\\ncredited extravagant claims, blanched and stopped speech \\n\\nin mid-sentence. The clerk froze momentarily in panic and \\n\\nsuddenly fled, screaming \"Fire!\" \\n\\nThe abbot made the sign of the cross. \"I had not known!\" \\n\\nhe whispered. \\n\\nThe scholar, having survived the first shock of the flare, \\n\\nprobed the basement with his gaze, noticing the drive-mill, \\n\\nthe monks who strained at its beams. His eyes traveled \\n\\nmeasured the meaning of the wagon-wheel dynamo and \\n\\nthe monk who stood waiting, with downcast eyes, at the \\n\\nfoot of the stairs. \\n\\n\"Incredible!\" he breathed. \\n\\nThe monk at the foot of the stairs bowed in \\n\\nacknowledgment and depreciation. The blue-white glare \\n\\ncast knife-edge shadows in the room, and the candle \\n\\nflames became blurred wisps in the tide of light. \\n\\nmust be an ancient– but no! Unthinkable!\" \\n\\nHe moved on down the stairs like a man in a trance. He \\n\\nstopped beside Brother Kornhoer and gazed at him \\n\\ncuriously for a moment, then stepped onto the basement \\n\\nfloor. Touching nothing, asking nothing, peering at \\n\\neverything, he wandered about the machinery, inspecting \\n\\nthe dynamo, the wiring, the lamp itself. \\n\\n\"It just doesn\\'t seem possible, but– \" \\n\\nThe abbot recovered his senses and descended the stairs. \\n\\n\"You\\'re dispensed from silence!\" he whispered at Brother \\n\\nKornhoer. \"Talk to him. I\\'m– a little dazed.\" \\n\\nThe monk brightened. \"You like it, m\\'Lord Abbot?\" \\n\\n\"Ghastly,\" wheezed Dom Paulo. \\n\\nThe inventor\\'s countenance sagged. \\n\\n\"It\\'s a shocking way to treat a guest! It frightened the \\n\\nthon\\'s assistant out of his wits. I\\'m mortified!\" \\n\\n\"Well, it is rather bright.\"  \\n\\n\"Hellish! Go talk to him while I think of a way to \\n\\napologize.\" \\n\\nBut the scholar had apparently made a judgment on the \\n\\nbasis of his observations, for he stalked toward them \\n\\nswiftly. His face seemed strained, and his manner crisp. \\n\\n\"A lamp of electricity,\" he said. \"How have you managed to \\n\\nkeep it hidden for all these centuries! After all these years \\n\\nof trying to arrive at a theory of– \" He choked slightly, and \\n\\nseemed to be fighting for self-control, as if he had been \\n\\nthe victim of a monstrous practical joke. \"Why have you \\n\\nhidden it? Is there some religious significance– And what– \\n\\n\" Complete confusion stopped him. He shook his head and \\n\\nlooked around as if for an escape. \\n\\n\"You misunderstand,\" the abbot said weakly, catching at \\n\\nBrother Kornhoer\\'s arm. \"For the love of God, Brother, \\n\\nexplain!\" \\n\\nBut there was no balm to soothe an affront to professional \\n\\npride– then or in any other age. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter  \\n\\nChapter Nineteen  \\n\\nAfter the unfortunate incident in the basement, the abbot \\n\\nsought by every conceivable means to make amends for \\n\\nthat unhappy moment. Thon Taddeo gave no outward sign \\n\\nof rancor, and even offered his hosts an apology for his \\n\\nspontaneous judgment of the incident, after the inventor of \\n\\nthe device had given the scholar a detailed account of its \\n\\nrecent design and manufacture. But the apology succeeded \\n\\nonly in convincing the abbot further that the blunder had \\n\\nbeen serious. It put the thon in the position of a \\n\\nmountaineer who has scaled an \"unconquered\" height only \\n\\nto find a rival\\'s initials carved in the summit rock– and the \\n\\nrival hadn\\'t told him in advance. It must have been \\n\\nshattering for him, Dom Paulo thought, because of the way \\n\\nit was handled. \\n\\nIf the thon had not insisted (with a firmness perhaps born \\n\\nof embarrassment) that its light was of a superior quality, \\n\\nsufficiently bright even for close scrutiny of brittle and \\n\\nage-worn documents which tended to be indecipherable by \\n\\ncandlelight, Dom Paulo would have removed the lamp from \\n\\nthe basement immediately. But Thon Taddeo had insisted \\n\\nthat he liked it– only to discover, then, that it was \\n\\nnecessary to keep at least four novices or postulants \\n\\ncontinuously employed at cranking the dynamo and  \\n\\nadjusting the arc-gap; thereupon, he begged that the lamp \\n\\nbe removed– but then it was Paulo\\'s turn to become \\n\\ninsistent that it remain in place. \\n\\nSo it was that the scholar began his researches at the \\n\\nabbey, continuously aware of the three novices who toiled \\n\\nat the drivemill and the fourth novice who invited \\n\\nand adjusted– a situation which caused the Poet to versify \\n\\nmercilessly concerning the demon Embarrassment and the \\n\\noutrages he perpetrated in the name of penitence or \\n\\nappeasement. \\n\\nFor several days the thon and his assistant studied the \\n\\nlibrary itself, the files, the monastery\\'s records apart from \\n\\nthe Memorabilia– as if by determining the validity of the \\n\\noyster, they might establish the possibility of the pearl. \\n\\nknees in the entrance of the refectory, and for a moment \\n\\nhe entertained the impression that the fellow was \\n\\nperforming some special devotion before the image of \\n\\nMary above the door, but a rattle of tools put an end to the \\n\\nillusion. The assistant laid a carpenter\\'s level across the \\n\\nentranceway and measured the concave depression worn \\n\\nin the floor stones by centuries of monastic sandals. \\n\\n\"We\\'re looking for ways of determining dates,\" he told \\n\\nKornhoer when questioned. \"This seemed like a good place \\n\\nto establish a standard for rate of wear, since the traffic\\'s \\n\\neasy to estimate. Three meals per man per day since the \\n\\nstones were laid.\" \\n\\nKornhoer could not help being impressed by their \\n\\nthoroughness; the activity mystified him. \"The abbey\\'s \\n\\narchitectural records are complete,\" he said. \"They can tell \\n\\nyou exactly when each building and wing was added. Why \\n\\nnot save your time?\" \\n\\nThe man glanced up innocently. \"My master has a saying: \\n\\n\\'Nayol is without speech, and therefore never lies.\\'\" \\n\\n\"Nayol?\" \\n\\n\"One of the Nature gods of the Red River people. He \\n\\nultimate authority. Recorders may lie, but Nature is \\n\\nincapable of it.\" He noticed the monk\\'s expression and \\n\\nadded hastily: \"No canard is implied. It is simply a doctrine \\n\\nof the thon\\'s that everything must be crossreferenced to \\n\\nthe objective.\" \\n\\n\"A fascinating notion,\" murmured Kornhoer, and bent \\n\\ndown to examine the man\\'s sketch of a cross-section of \\n\\nthe floor\\'s concavity. \"Why, it\\'s shaped like what Brother \\n\\nMajek calls a normal distribution curve. How strange.\" \\n\\n\"Not strange. The probability of a footstep deviating from \\n\\nthe center-line would tend to follow the normal error \\n\\nfunction.\" \\n\\nKornhoer was enthralled. \"I\\'ll call Brother Majek,\" he said. \\n\\nThe abbot\\'s interest in his guests\\' inspection of the \\n\\npremises was less esoteric. \"Why,\" he demanded of Gault, \\n\\n\"are they making detailed drawings of our fortifications?\" \\n\\nThe prior looked surprised. \"I hadn\\'t heard of it. You mean \\n\\nThon Taddeo– \" \\n\\n\"No. The officers that came with him. They\\'re going about \\n\\nit quite systematically.\" \\n\\n\"How did you find out?\" \\n\\n\"The Poet told me.\"  \\n\\n\"The Poet! Hah!\"  \\n\\n\"Unfortunately, he was telling the truth this time. He  \\n\\npickpocketed one of their sketches.\"  \\n\\n\"You have it?\"  \\n\\n\"No, I made him return it. But I don\\'t like it. It\\'s ominous.\"  \\n\\n\"I suppose the Poet asked a price for the information?\"  \\n\\n\"Oddly enough, he didn\\'t. He took an instant dislike to the  \\n\\nthon. He\\'s gone around muttering to himself ever since  \\n\\nthey came.\"  \\n\\n\"The Poet has always muttered.\"  \\n\\n\"But not in a serious vein.\"  \\n\\n\"Why do you suppose they\\'re making the drawings?\"  \\n\\nPaulo made a grim mouth. \"Unless we find out otherwise,  \\n\\nwe\\'ll assume their interest is recondite and professional. As  \\n\\na walled citadel, the abbey has been a success. It\\'s never \\n\\nbeen taken by siege or assault, and perhaps their \\n\\nprofessional admiration is aroused.\" \\n\\nFather Gault gazed speculatively across the desert toward \\n\\nthe east. \"Come to think of it, if an army meant to strike \\n\\nwest across the plains, they\\'d probably have to establish a \\n\\ngarrison somewhere in this region before marching on \\n\\nDenver.\" He thought for a few moments and began to look \\n\\nalarmed. \"And here they\\'d have a fortress ready-made!\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid that\\'s occurred to them.\" \\n\\n\"You think they were sent as spies?\" \\n\\n\"No, no! I doubt if Hannegan himself has ever heard of us. \\n\\nBut they are here, and they are officers, and they can\\'t \\n\\nhelp looking around and getting ideas. And now very likely \\n\\nHannegan is going to hear about us.\" \\n\\n\"What do you intend doing?\" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know yet.\" \\n\\n\"Why not talk to Thon Taddeo about it?\"  \\n\\n\"The officers aren\\'t his servants. They were only sent as an \\n\\nescort to protect him. What can he do?\" \\n\\n\"He\\'s Hannegan\\'s kinsman, and he has influence.\" \\n\\nThe abbot nodded. \"I\\'ll try to think of a way to approach \\n\\nhim on the matter. We\\'ll watch what\\'s going on for a while \\n\\nfirst, though.\" \\n\\nIn the days that followed, Thon Taddeo completed his \\n\\nstudy of the oyster and, apparently satisfied that it was not \\n\\ntask was not simple. \\n\\nQuantities of facsimile copy were scrutinized. Chains \\n\\nrattled and clanked as the more precious books came \\n\\ndown from their shelves. In the case of partially damaged \\n\\nor deteriorated originals, it seemed unwise to trust the \\n\\nfacsimile-maker\\'s interpretation and eyesight. The actual \\n\\nmanuscripts dating back to Leibowitzian times which had \\n\\nbeen sealed in airtight casks and locked in special storage \\n\\nvaults for indefinitely long preservation were then brought \\n\\nout. \\n\\nThe thon\\'s assistant assembled several pounds of notes.  \\n\\nAfter the fifth day of it, Thon Taddeo\\'s pace quickened, and \\n\\nhis manner reflected the eagerness of a hungry hound \\n\\ncatching scent of tasty game. \\n\\nincredulity. \"Fragments from a twentieth century physicist! \\n\\nThe equations are even consistent.\" \\n\\nKornhoer peered over his shoulder. \"I\\'ve seen that,\" he \\n\\nsaid breathlessly. \"I could never make heads or tails of it. \\n\\nIs the subject matter important?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure yet. The mathematics is beautiful, beautiful! \\n\\nLook here– this expression– notice the extremely \\n\\ncontracted form. This thing under the radical sign– it looks \\n\\nlike the product of two derivatives, but it really represents \\n\\na whole set of derivatives.\" \\n\\n\"How?\" \\n\\n\"The indices permute into an expanded expression; \\n\\notherwise, it couldn\\'t possibly represent a line integral, as \\n\\nthe author says it is. It\\'s lovely. And see here– this \\n\\nsimple-looking expression. The simplicity is deceptive. It \\n\\nobviously represents not one, but a whole system of \\n\\nequations, in a very contracted form. It took me a couple \\n\\nof days to realize that the author was thinking of the \\n\\nrelationships– not just of quantities to quantities– but of \\n\\nwhole systems to other systems. I don\\'t yet know all the \\n\\nphysical quantities involved, but the sophistication of the \\n\\nmathematics is just– just quietly superb! If it\\'s a hoax, it\\'s \\n\\ninspired! If it\\'s authentic, we may be in unbelievable luck. \\n\\nIn either case, it\\'s magnificent. I must see the earliest \\n\\npossible copy of it.\" \\n\\nBrother Librarian groaned as yet another lead-sealed cask \\n\\nwas rolled out of storage for unsealing. Armbruster was \\n\\nnot impressed by the fact that the secular scholar, in two \\n\\ndays, had unraveled a bit of a puzzle that had been lying \\n\\naround, a complete enigma, for a dozen centuries. To the \\n\\ncustodian of the Memorabilia, each Unsealing represented \\n\\nanother decrease in the probable lifetime of the contents of \\n\\nthe cask, and he made no attempt to conceal his \\n\\ndisapproval of the entire proceeding. To Brother Librarian, \\n\\nwhose task in life was the preservation of books, the \\n\\nprincipal reason for the existence of books was that they \\n\\nmight be preserved perpetually. Usage was secondary, and \\n\\nto be avoided if it threatened longevity. \\n\\nThon Taddeo\\'s enthusiasm for his task waxed stronger as \\n\\nthe days passed, and the abbot breathed easier as he \\n\\nwatched the thon\\'s earlier skepticism melt away with each \\n\\nnew perusal of some fragmentary pre-Deluge science text. \\n\\nThe scholar had not made any clear assertions about the \\n\\nintended scope of his investigation; perhaps, at first, his \\n\\naim had been vague, but now he went about his work with \\n\\nthe crisp precision of a man following a plan. Sensing the \\n\\ndawn of something, Dom Paulo decided to offer the cock a \\n\\nperch for crowing, in case the bird felt an impulse to \\n\\nannounce a coming daybreak. \\n\\n\"The community has been curious about your labors,\" he \\n\\ntold the scholar. \"We\\'d like to hear about it, if you don\\'t \\n\\nmind discussing it. Of course we\\'ve all heard of your \\n\\ntheoretical work at your own collegium, but it\\'s too \\n\\ntechnical for most of us to understand. Would it be \\n\\npossible for you to tell us something about it in– oh, \\n\\ngeneral terms that non-specialists might understand? The \\n\\ncommunity has been grumping at me because I hadn\\'t \\n\\ninvited you to lecture; but I thought you might prefer to \\n\\nget the feel of the place first. Of course if you\\'d rather not– \\n\\n\" \\n\\nThe thon\\'s gaze seemed to clamp calipers on the abbot\\'s \\n\\ncranium and measure it six ways. He smiled doubtfully. \\n\\n\"You\\'d like me to explain our work in the simplest possible \\n\\nlanguage?\" \\n\\n\"Something like that, if it\\'s possible.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s just it.\" He laughed. \"The untrained man reads a \\n\\npaper on natural science and thinks; \\'Now why couldn\\'t he \\n\\nexplain this in simple language.\\' He can\\'t seem to realize \\n\\nthat what he tried to read was the simplest possible \\n\\nlanguage– for that subject matter. In fact, a great deal of \\n\\nnatural philosophy is simply a process of linguistic \\n\\nsimplification– an effort to invent languages in which half a \\n\\npage of equations can express an idea which could not be \\n\\nstated in less than a thousand pages of so-called \\'simple\\' \\n\\nlanguage. Do I make myself clear?\" \\n\\n\"I think so. Since you do make yourself clear, perhaps you \\n\\ncould tell us about that aspect of it, then. Unless the \\n\\nsuggestion is premature– as far as your work with the \\n\\nMemorabilia is concerned.\" \\n\\n\"Well, no. We now have a fairly clear idea of where we\\'re \\n\\ngoing and what we have to work with here. It will still take \\n\\nconsiderable time to finish of course. The pieces have to be \\n\\nfitted together, and they don\\'t all belong to the same \\n\\npuzzle. We can\\'t yet predict what we can glean from it, but \\n\\nwe\\'re fairly sure of what we can\\'t. I\\'m happy to say it looks \\n\\nhopeful. I have no objection to explaining the general \\n\\nscope, but– \" He repeated the doubtful shrug. \\n\\n\"What bothers you?\" \\n\\nThe thon seemed mildly embarrassed. \"Only an \\n\\nuncertainty about my audience. I would not wish to offend \\n\\nanyone\\'s religious beliefs.\" \\n\\n\"But how could you? Isn\\'t it a matter of natural \\n\\nphilosophy? Of physical science?\" \\n\\n\"Of course. But many people\\'s ideas about the world have \\n\\nbecome colored with religious– well, what I mean is– \" \\n\\n\"But if your subject matter is the physical world, how could \\n\\nyou possibly offend? Especially this community. We\\'ve \\n\\nbeen waiting for a long time to see the world start taking \\n\\nan interest in itself again. At the risk of seeming boastful, I \\n\\nmight point out that we have a few rather clever amateurs \\n\\nin natural science right here in the monastery. There\\'s \\n\\nBrother Majek, and there\\'s Brother Kornhoer– \" \\n\\n\"Kornhoer!\" The thon glanced up warily at the arc lamp \\n\\nand looked away blinking. \"I can\\'t understand it!\" \\n\\n\"The lamp? But surely you– \" \\n\\nyou get over the shock of seeing it really work. It should \\n\\nwork. It would work on paper, assuming various \\n\\nundeterminables and guessing at some unavailable data. \\n\\nBut the clean impetuous leap from the vague hypothesis to \\n\\na working model– \" The thon coughed nervously. \"It\\'s \\n\\nwaggled a forefinger at the dynamo \"– is a standing \\n\\nbroadjump across about twenty years of preliminary \\n\\nexperimentation, starting with an understanding of the \\n\\nprinciples. Kornhoer just dispensed with the preliminaries. \\n\\nYou believe in miraculous interventions? I don\\'t, but there \\n\\nyou have a real case of it. Wagon wheels!\" He laughed. \\n\\n\"What could he do if he had a machine shop? I can\\'t \\n\\nunderstand what a man like that is doing cooped up in a \\n\\nmonastery.\" \\n\\n\"Perhaps Brother Kornhoer should explain that to you,\" \\n\\nsaid Dom Paulo, trying to keep an edge of stiffness out of \\n\\nhis tone. \\n\\n\"Yes, well– \" Thon Taddeo\\'s visual calipers began \\n\\nmeasuring the old priest again. \"If you really feel that no \\n\\none would take offense at hearing non-traditional ideas, I \\n\\nwould be glad to discuss our work. But some of it may \\n\\nconflict with established preju– uh– established opinion.\" \\n\\n\"Good! Then it should be fascinating.\" \\n\\nA time was agreed upon, and Dom Paulo felt relief. The \\n\\nesoteric gulf between Christian monk and secular \\n\\ninvestigator of Nature would surely be narrowed by a free \\n\\nexchange of ideas, he felt. Kornhoer had already narrowed \\n\\nit slightly, had he not? More communication, not less, was \\n\\nprobably the best therapy for easing any tension. And the \\n\\ncloudy veil of doubt and mistrusting hesitancy would be \\n\\nparted, would it not? as soon as the thon saw that his \\n\\nhosts were not quite such unreasonable intellectual \\n\\nreactionaries as the scholar seemed to suspect. Paulo felt \\n\\nsome shame for his earlier misgivings. Patience, Lord, with \\n\\na well-meaning fool, he prayed. \\n\\n\"But you can\\'t ignore the officers and their sketchbooks,\" \\n\\nGault reminded him. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter  \\n\\nChapter Twenty  \\n\\nFrom the lectern in the refectory, the reader was intoning \\n\\nthe announcements. Candlelight blanched the faces of the \\n\\nrobed legions who stood motionless behind their stools and \\n\\nwaited for the beginning of the evening meal. The reader\\'s \\n\\nvoice echoed hollowly in the high vaulted dining room \\n\\nwhose ceiling was lost in brooding shadows above the \\n\\npools of candle-glow that spotted the wooden tables. \\n\\n\"The Reverend Father Abbot has commanded me to \\n\\nannounce,\" called the reader, \"that the rule of abstinence \\n\\nfor today is dispensed at tonight\\'s meal. We shall have \\n\\nguests, as you may have heard. All religious may partake \\n\\nof tonight\\'s banquet in honor of Thon Taddeo and his \\n\\ngroup; you may eat meat. Conversation– if you\\'ll keep it \\n\\nquiet– will be permitted during the meal.\" \\n\\nSuppressed vocal noises, not unlike strangled cheers, \\n\\ncame from the ranks of the novices. The tables were set. \\n\\nFood had not yet made an appearance, but large dining \\n\\ntrays replaced the usual mush bowls, kindling appetites \\n\\nwith hints of a feast. The familiar milk mugs stayed in the \\n\\npantry, their places taken for tonight by the best wine \\n\\ncups. Roses were scattered along the boards. \\n\\nThe abbot stopped in the corridor to wait for the reader to  \\n\\nfinish reading. He glanced at the table set for himself, \\n\\nFather Gault, the honored guest, and his party. Bad \\n\\narithmetic again in the kitchen, he thought. Eight places \\n\\nhad been set. Three officers, the thon and his assistant, \\n\\nand the two priests made seven– unless, in some unlikely \\n\\ncase, Father Gault had asked Brother Kornhoer to sit with \\n\\nthem. The reader concluded the announcements, and Dom \\n\\nPaulo entered the hail. \\n\\n\"Flectamus genua,\" intoned the reader. \\n\\nThe robed legions genuflected with military precision as \\n\\nthe abbot blessed his flock. \\n\\n\"Levate.\" \\n\\nThe legions arose. Dom Paulo took his place at the special \\n\\ntable and glanced back toward the entrance. Gault should \\n\\nbe bringing the others. Previously their meals had been \\n\\nserved in the guesthouse rather than the refectory, to \\n\\navoid subjecting them to the austerity of the monks\\' own \\n\\nfrugal fare. \\n\\nWhen the guests came, he looked around for Brother  \\n\\nKornhoer, but the monk was not with them.  \\n\\n\"Why the eighth place setting?\" he murmured to Father \\n\\nGault when they had taken their places. \\n\\nGault looked blank and shrugged. \\n\\nThe scholar filled the place on the abbot\\'s right and the \\n\\nothers fell in toward the foot of the table, leaving the place \\n\\non his left empty. He turned to beckon Kornhoer to join \\n\\nthem, but the reader began intoning the preface before he \\n\\ncould catch the monk\\'s eye. \\n\\n\"Oremus,\" answered the abbot, and the legions bowed. \\n\\nDuring the blessing, someone slipped quietly into the seat \\n\\non the abbot\\'s left. The abbot frowned but did not look up \\n\\nto identify the culprit during the prayer. \\n\\n\". . . et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.\" \\n\\n\"Sedete,\" called the reader, and the ranks began seating \\n\\nthemselves. \\n\\nThe abbot glanced sharply at the figure on his left.  \\n\\n\"Poet!\"  \\n\\nThe bruised lily bowed extravagantly and smiled. \"Good \\n\\nevening, Sires, learned Thon, distinguished hosts,\" he \\n\\norated. \"What are we having tonight? Roast fish and \\n\\nhoneycombs in honor of the temporal resurrection that\\'s \\n\\nupon us? Or have you, m\\'Lord Abbot, finally cooked the \\n\\ngoose of the mayor of the village?\" \\n\\n\"I would like to cook– \" \\n\\n\"Ha!\" quoth the Poet, and turned affably toward the \\n\\nscholar. \"Such culinary excellence one enjoys in this place, \\n\\nThon Taddeo! You should join us more often. I suppose \\n\\nthey are feeding you nothing but roast pheasant and \\n\\nunimaginative beef in the guesthouse. A shame! Here one \\n\\nfares better. I do hope Brother Chef has his usual gusto \\n\\ntonight, his inward flame, his enchanted touch. Ah. . .\" The \\n\\nPoet rubbed his hands and smirked hungrily. \"Perhaps we \\n\\nshall have his inspired Mock Pork with Maize a la Friar \\n\\nJohn, eh?\" \\n\\n\"It sounds interesting,\" said the scholar. \"What is it?\" \\n\\n\"Greasy armadillo with parched corn, boiled in donkey  \\n\\nmilk. A regular Sunday special.\" \\n\\nfor his presence. He wasn\\'t invited.\" \\n\\nThe scholar surveyed the Poet with detached amusement. \\n\\n\"M\\'Lord Hannegan, too, keeps several court fools,\" he told \\n\\nPaulo. \"I\\'m familiar with the species. You needn\\'t apologize \\n\\nfor him.\" \\n\\nThe Poet sprang up from his stool and bowed deeply \\n\\nbefore the thou. \"Allow me instead to apologize for the \\n\\nabbot, Sire!\" he cried with feeling. \\n\\nHe held the bow for a moment. They waited for him to \\n\\nfinish his foolishness. Instead, he shrugged suddenly, sat \\n\\ndown, and speared a smoking fowl from the platter \\n\\nbit into it with gusto. They watched him with puzzlement. \\n\\n\"I suppose you\\'re right in not accepting my apology for \\n\\nhim,\" he said to the thon at last. \\n\\nThe scholar reddened slightly. \\n\\n\"Before I throw you out, worm,\" said Gault, \"let\\'s probe \\n\\nthe depths of this iniquity.\" \\n\\nThe Poet waggled his head and munched thoughtfully. \"It\\'s \\n\\npretty deep, all right,\" he admitted. \\n\\nSomeday Gault is going to strangle himself on that foot of \\n\\nhis, thought Dom Paulo. \\n\\nBut the younger priest was visibly annoyed, and sought to \\n\\ndraw the incident out ad absurdum in order to find grounds \\n\\nfor quashing the fool. \"Apologize at length for your host, \\n\\nPoet,\" he commanded. \"And explain yourself as you go.\" \\n\\n\"Drop it, Father, drop it,\" Paulo said hastily. \\n\\nThe Poet smiled graciously at the abbot. \"That\\'s all right, \\n\\nm\\'Lord,\" he said. \"I don\\'t mind apologizing for you in the \\n\\nleast. You apologize for me, I apologize for you, and isn\\'t \\n\\nthat a fitting maneuver in charity and good will? Nobody \\n\\nneed apologize for himself– which is always so humiliating. \\n\\nUsing my system, however, everyone gets apologized for, \\n\\nand nobody has to do his own apologizing.\" \\n\\nOnly the officers seemed to find the Poet\\'s remarks  \\n\\namusing. Apparently the expectation of humor was enough \\n\\nto produce the Illusion of humor, and the comedian could \\n\\nelicit laughter with gesture and expression, regardless of \\n\\nwhat he said. Thon Taddeo wore a dry smirk, but it was \\n\\nthe kind of look a man might give a clumsy performance \\n\\nby a trained animal. \\n\\n\"And so,\" the Poet was continuing, \"if you would but allow \\n\\nme to serve as your humble helper, m\\'Lord, you would \\n\\nnever have to eat your own crow. As your Apologetic \\n\\nAdvocate, for example, I might be delegated by you to \\n\\noffer contrition to important guests for the existence of \\n\\nbedbugs. And to bedbugs for the abrupt change of fare.\" \\n\\nThe abbot glowered and resisted an impulse to grind the \\n\\nPoet\\'s bare toe with the heel of his sandal. He kicked the \\n\\nfellow\\'s ankle, but the fool persisted. \\n\\n\"I would assume all the blame for you, of course,\" he said, \\n\\nnoisily chewing white meat. \"It\\'s a fine system, one which \\n\\nI was prepared to make available to you too, Most Eminent \\n\\nhave been given to understand that systems of logic and \\n\\nmethodology must be devised and perfected before science \\n\\nadvances. And my system of negotiable and transferable \\n\\napologetics would have been of particular value to you, \\n\\nThon Taddeo.\" \\n\\n\"Would have?\" \\n\\n\"Yes. It\\'s a pity. Somebody stole my blue-headed goat.\" \\n\\n\"Blue-headed goat?\" \\n\\n\"He had a head as bald as Hannegan\\'s, Your Brilliance, and \\n\\nblue as the tip of Brother Armbruster\\'s nose. I meant to \\n\\nmake you a present of the animal, but some dastard \\n\\nfilched him before you came.\" \\n\\nThe abbot clenched his teeth and held his heel poised over \\n\\nthe Poet\\'s toe. Thon Taddeo was frowning slightly, but he \\n\\nseemed determined to untangle the Poet\\'s obscure skein of \\n\\nmeaning. \\n\\n\"Do we need a blue-headed goat?\" he asked his clerk. \\n\\n\"I can see no pressing urgency about it, sir,\" said the \\n\\nclerk. \\n\\n\"But the need is obvious!\" said the Poet. \"They say you are  \\n\\nwriting equations that will one day remake the world. They \\n\\nsay a new light is dawning. If there\\'s to be light, then \\n\\nsomebody will have to be blamed for the darkness that\\'s \\n\\npast.\" \\n\\n\"Ah, thence the goat.\" Thou Taddeo glanced at the abbot. \\n\\n\"A sickly jest. Is it the best he can do?\" \\n\\n\"You\\'ll notice he\\'s unemployed. But let us talk of \\n\\nsomething sensib– \" \\n\\n\"No, no, no, no!\" objected the Poet. \"You mistake my \\n\\nmeaning, Your Brilliance. The goat is to be enshrined and \\n\\nhonored, not blamed! Crown him with the crown Saint \\n\\nLeibowitz sent you, and thank him for the light that\\'s \\n\\nrising. Then blame Leibowitz, and drive him into the \\n\\ndesert. That way you won\\'t have to wear the second \\n\\ncrown. The one with thorns. Responsibility, it\\'s called.\" \\n\\nThe Poet\\'s hostility had broken out into the open, and he \\n\\nwas no longer trying to seem humorous. The thon gazed at \\n\\nhim icily. The abbot\\'s heel wavered again over the Poet\\'s \\n\\ntoe, and again had reluctant mercy on it. \\n\\n\"And when,\" said the Poet, \"your patron\\'s army comes to  \\n\\nseize this abbey, the goat can be placed in the courtyard \\n\\nand taught to bleat \\'There\\'s been nobody here but me, \\n\\nnobody here but me\\' whenever a stranger comes by.\" \\n\\nOne of the officers started up from his stool with an angry \\n\\ngrunt, his hand reaching reflexively for his saber. He broke \\n\\nthe hilt clear of the scabbard, and six inches of steel \\n\\nglistened a warning at the Poet. The thon seized his wrist \\n\\nand tried to force the blade back in the sheath, but it was \\n\\nlike tugging at the arm of a marble statue. \\n\\n\"Ah! A swordsman as well as a draftsman!\" taunted the \\n\\nPoet, apparently unafraid of dying. \"Your sketches of the \\n\\nabbey\\'s defenses show such promise of artistic– \" \\n\\nThe officer barked an oath and the blade leaped clean of \\n\\nthe scabbard. His comrades seized him, however, before \\n\\nhe could lunge. An astonished rumble came from the \\n\\ncongregation as the startled monks came to their feet. The \\n\\nPoet was still smiling blandly. \\n\\n\"– artistic growth,\" he continued. \"I predict that one day \\n\\nyour drawing of the underwall tunnels will be hung in a \\n\\nmuseum of fine– \" \\n\\nA dull chunk! came from under the table. The Poet paused  \\n\\nin mid-bite, lowered the wishbone from his mouth, and \\n\\nturned slowly white. He munched, swallowed, and \\n\\ncontinued to lose color. He gazed abstractly upward. \\n\\n\"You\\'re grinding it off,\" he muttered out of the side of his \\n\\nmouth. \\n\\n\"Through talking?\" the abbot asked, and continued to \\n\\ngrind. \\n\\n\"I think I have a bone in my throat,\" the Poet admitted. \\n\\n\"You wish to be excused?\" \\n\\n\"I am afraid I must.\" \\n\\n\"A pity. We shall miss you.\" Paulo gave the toe one last \\n\\ngrind for good measure. \"You may go then.\" \\n\\nThe Poet exhaled gustily, blotted his mouth, and arose. He \\n\\ndrained his wine cup and inverted it in the center of the \\n\\ntray. Something in his manner compelled them to watch \\n\\nhim. He pulled down his eyelid with one thumb, bent his \\n\\nhead over his cupped palm and pressed. The eyeball \\n\\npopped out into his palm, bringing a choking sound from  \\n\\nthe Texarkanans who were apparently unaware of the \\n\\nPoet\\'s artificial orb. \\n\\n\"Watch him carefully,\" said the Poet to the glass eye, and \\n\\nthen deposited it on the upturned base of his wine cup \\n\\nm\\'Lords,\" he said cheerfully to the group, and marched \\n\\naway. \\n\\nThe angry officer muttered a curse and struggled to free \\n\\nhimself from the grasp of his comrades. \\n\\n\"Take him back to his quarters and sit on him till he cools \\n\\noff,\" the thon told them. \"And better see that he doesn\\'t \\n\\nget a chance at that lunatic.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m mortified,\" he said to the abbot, when the livid \\n\\nguardsman was hauled away. \"They aren\\'t my servants, \\n\\nand I can\\'t give them orders. But I can promise you he will \\n\\ngrovel for this. And if he refuses to apologize and leave \\n\\nimmediately, he\\'ll have to match that hasty sword against \\n\\nmine before noon tomorrow.\" \\n\\n\"No bloodshed!\" begged the priest. \"It was nothing. Let\\'s  \\n\\nall forget it.\" His hands were trembling, his countenance  \\n\\ngray. \\n\\n\"He will make apology and go,\" Thon Taddeo insisted, \"or I \\n\\nshall offer to kill him. Don\\'t worry, he doesn\\'t dare fight \\n\\nme because if he won, Hannegan would have him impaled \\n\\non the public stake while they forced his wife to– but never \\n\\nmind that. He\\'ll grovel and go. Just the same, I\\'m deeply \\n\\nashamed that such a thing could have come about.\" \\n\\n\"I should have had the Poet thrown out as soon as he \\n\\nshowed up. He provoked the whole thing, and I failed to \\n\\nstop it. The provocation was clear.\" \\n\\n\"Provocation? By the fanciful lie of a vagrant fool? Josard \\n\\nreacted as if the Poet\\'s charges were true.\" \\n\\n\"Then you don\\'t know that they are preparing a \\n\\ncomprehensive report on the military value of our abbey as \\n\\na fortress?\" \\n\\nThe scholar\\'s jaw fell. He stared from one priest to the \\n\\nother in apparent unbelief. \\n\\n\"Can this be true?\" he asked after a long silence. \\n\\nThe abbot nodded.  \\n\\n\"And you\\'ve permitted us to stay.\" \\n\\n\"We keep no secrets. Your companions are welcome to \\n\\nmake such a study if they wish. I would not presume to \\n\\nask why they want the information. The Poet\\'s assumption, \\n\\nof course, was merest fantasy.\" \\n\\n\"Of course,\" the thon said weakly, not looking at his host. \\n\\n\"Surely your prince has no aggressive ambitions in this \\n\\nregion, as the Poet hinted.\" \\n\\n\"Surely not.\" \\n\\n\"And even if he did, I\\'m sure he would have the wisdom– \\n\\nor at least the wise counselors to lead him– to understand \\n\\nthat our abbey\\'s value as a storehouse of ancient wisdom \\n\\nis many times greater than its value as a citadel.\" \\n\\nThe thon caught the note of pleading, the undercurrent of \\n\\nsupplication for help, in the priest\\'s voice, and he seemed \\n\\nto brood on it, picking lightly at his food and saying \\n\\nnothing for a time. \\n\\n\"We\\'ll speak of this matter again before I return to the  \\n\\ncollegium,\" he promised quietly.  \\n\\nA pall had fallen on the banquet, but it began to lift during \\n\\nthe group singing in the courtyard after the meal, and it \\n\\nvanished entirely when the time came for the scholar\\'s \\n\\nlecture in the Great Hall. Embarrassment seemed at an \\n\\nend, and the group had resumed a surface cordiality. \\n\\nDom Paulo led the thon to the lectern; Gault and the don\\'s \\n\\nclerk followed, joining them on the platform. Applause \\n\\nrang out heartily following the abbot\\'s introduction of the \\n\\nthon; the hush that followed suggested the silence of a \\n\\ncourtroom awaiting a verdict. The scholar was no gifted \\n\\norator, but the verdict proved satisfying to the monastic \\n\\nthrong. \\n\\n\"I have been amazed at what we\\'ve found here,\" he told \\n\\nthem. \"A few weeks ago I would not have believed, did not \\n\\nbelieve, that records such as you have in your Memorabilia \\n\\ncould still be surviving from the fall of the last mighty \\n\\ncivilization. It is still hard to believe, but evidence forces us \\n\\nto adopt the hypothesis that the documents are authentic. \\n\\nTheir survival here is incredible enough; but even more  \\n\\nfantastic, to me, is the fact that they have gone unnoticed \\n\\nduring this century, until now. Lately there have been men \\n\\ncapable of appreciating their potential value– and not only \\n\\nmyself. What Thon Kaschler might have done with them \\n\\nwhile he was alive!– even seventy years ago.\" \\n\\nThe sea of monks\\' faces was alight with smiles upon \\n\\nhearing so favorable a reaction to the Memorabilia from \\n\\none so gifted as the thon. Paulo wondered why they failed \\n\\nto sense the faint undercurrent of resentment– or was it \\n\\nsuspicion?– in the speaker\\'s tone. \"Had I known of these \\n\\nsources ten years ago,\" he was saying, \"much of my work \\n\\nin optics would have been unnecessary.\" Ahha! thought \\n\\nthe abbot, so that\\'s it. Or at least part of it. He\\'s finding \\n\\nout that some of his discoveries are only rediscoveries, and \\n\\nit leaves a bitter taste. But surely he must know that never \\n\\nduring his lifetime can he be more than a recoverer of lost \\n\\nworks; however brilliant, he can only do what others \\n\\nbefore him had done. And so it would be, inevitably, until \\n\\nthe world became as highly developed as it had been \\n\\nbefore the Flame Deluge. \\n\\nNevertheless, it was apparent that Thon Taddeo was \\n\\nimpressed. \"My time here is limited,\" he went on. \"From \\n\\nwhat I have seen, I suspect that it will take twenty \\n\\nspecialists several decades to finish milking the \\n\\nMemorabilia for understandable information. Physical \\n\\nscience normally proceeds by inductive reasoning tested \\n\\nby experiment; but here the task is deductive. From a few \\n\\nbroken bits of general principles, we must attempt to grasp \\n\\nparticulars. In some cases, it may prove impossible. For \\n\\nexample– \" He paused for a moment to produce a packet \\n\\nof notes and thumbed through them briefly. \"Here is a \\n\\nquotation which I found buried downstairs. It\\'s from a \\n\\nfour-page fragment of a book which may have been an \\n\\nadvanced physics text. A few of you may have seen it.\" \\n\\n\"\\'– and if the space terms predominate in the expression \\n\\nfor the interval between event-points, the interval is said \\n\\nto be spacelike, since it is then possible to select a \\n\\nco-ordinate system– belonging to an observer with an \\n\\nadmissible velocity– in which the events appear \\n\\nsimultaneous, and therefore separated only spatially. If, \\n\\nhowever, the interval is timelike, the events cannot be \\n\\nsimultaneous in any co-ordinate system, but there exists a \\n\\nco-ordinate system in which the space terms will vanish \\n\\nentirely, so that the separation between events will be \\n\\npurely temporal, id est, occurring at the same place, but at \\n\\ndifferent times. Now upon examining the extremals of the \\n\\nreal interval– \\'\"  \\n\\nHe looked up with a whimsical smile. \"Has anyone here \\n\\nlooked at that reference lately?\" \\n\\nThe sea of faces remained blank. \\n\\n\"Anyone ever remember seeing it?\" \\n\\nKornhoer and two others cautiously lifted their hands. \\n\\n\"Anyone know what it means?\" \\n\\nThe hands quickly went down. \\n\\nThe thon chuckled. \"It\\'s followed by a page and a half of \\n\\nmathematics which I won\\'t try to read, but it treats some \\n\\nof our fundamental concepts as if they weren\\'t basic at all, \\n\\nbut evanescent appearances that change according to \\n\\none\\'s point of view. It ends with the word \\'therefore\\' but \\n\\nThe reasoning is impeccable, however, and the \\n\\nmathematics quite elegant, so that I can write the \\n\\nconclusion myself. It seems the conclusion of a madman. \\n\\nIt began with assumptions, however, which appeared \\n\\nequally mad. Is it a hoax? If it isn\\'t, what is its place in the \\n\\nwhole scheme of the science of the ancients? What \\n\\nprecedes it as prerequisite to understanding? What follows, \\n\\nand how can it be tested? Questions I can\\'t answer. This is \\n\\nonly one example of the many enigmas posed by these \\n\\npapers you\\'ve kept so long. Reasoning which touches \\n\\nexperiential reality nowhere is the business of \\n\\nangelologists and theologians, not of physical scientists. \\n\\nAnd yet such papers as these describe systems which \\n\\ntouch our experience nowhere. Were they within the \\n\\nexperimental reach of the ancients? Certain references \\n\\ntend to indicate it. One paper refers to elemental \\n\\ntransmutation– which we just recently established as \\n\\ntheoretically impossible– and then it says \\'experiment \\n\\nproves.\\' But how? \\n\\n\"It may take generations to evaluate and understand some \\n\\nof these things. It is unfortunate that they must remain \\n\\nhere in this inaccessible place, for it will take a \\n\\nconcentrated effort by numerous scholars to make \\n\\nmeaning of them. I am sure you realize that your present \\n\\nfacilities are inadequate– not to mention \\'inaccessible\\' to \\n\\nthe rest of the world.\" \\n\\nSeated on the platform behind the speaker, the abbot \\n\\nbegan to glower, waiting for the worst. Thon Taddeo \\n\\nchose, however, to offer no proposals. But his remarks \\n\\ncontinued to make clear his feeling that such relics \\n\\nbelonged in more competent hands than those of the \\n\\nmonks of the Albertian Order of Saint Leibowitz, and that \\n\\nthe situation as it prevailed was absurd. Perhaps sensing \\n\\nthe growing uneasiness in the room, he soon turned to the \\n\\nsubject of his immediate studies, which involved a more \\n\\nthorough investigation into the nature of light than had \\n\\nbeen made previously. Several of the abbey\\'s treasures \\n\\nwere proving to be of much help, and he hoped to devise \\n\\nsoon an experimental means for testing his theories. After \\n\\nsome discussion of the phenomenon of refraction, he \\n\\npaused, then said apologetically: \"I hope none of this \\n\\noffends anybody\\'s religious beliefs,\" and looked around \\n\\nquizzically. Seeing that their faces remained curious and \\n\\nbland, he continued for a time, then invited questions from \\n\\nthe congregation. \\n\\n\"Do you mind a question from the platform?\" asked the \\n\\nabbot. \"Not at all,\" said the scholar, looking a bit doubtful, \\n\\nas if thinking et tu, Brute. \\n\\n\"I was wondering what there is about the refrangible \\n\\nproperty of light that you thought might be offensive to \\n\\nreligion?\" \\n\\n\"Well– \" The thon paused uncomfortably. \"Monsignor \\n\\nApollo, whom you know, grew quite heated on the subject. \\n\\nHe said that light could not possibly have been refrangible \\n\\nbefore the Flood, because the rainbow was supposedly– \" \\n\\nthe remark. By the time the abbot had waved them to \\n\\nsilence, Thon Taddeo was beet red, and Dom Paulo had \\n\\nsome difficulty in maintaining his own solemn visage. \\n\\n\"Monsignor Apollo is a good man, a good priest, but all \\n\\nmen are apt to be incredible asses at times, especially \\n\\noutside their domains. I\\'m sorry I asked the question.\" \\n\\n\"The answer relieves me,\" said the scholar. \"I seek no \\n\\nquarrels.\" There were no further questions and the thon \\n\\nproceeded to his second topic: the growth and the present \\n\\nactivities of his collegium. The picture as he painted it \\n\\nseemed encouraging. The collegium was flooded with \\n\\napplicants who wanted to study at the institute. The \\n\\ncollegium was assuming an educational function as well as \\n\\nan investigative one. Interest in natural philosophy and \\n\\nscience was on the increase among the literate laity. The \\n\\ninstitute was being liberally endowed. Symptoms of revival  \\n\\nand renaissance. \\n\\n\"I might mention a few of the current researches and \\n\\ninvestigations being conducted by our people,\" he went on. \\n\\n\"Following Bret\\'s work on the behavior of gases, Thon \\n\\nViche Mortoin is investigating the possibilities for the \\n\\nartificial production of ice. Thou Friider Haib is seeking a \\n\\npractical means for transmitting messages by electrical \\n\\nvariations along a wire– \" The list was long, and the monks \\n\\nappeared impressed. Studies in many fields– medicine, \\n\\nastronomy, geology, mathematics, mechanics– were being \\n\\nundertaken. A few seemed impractical and ill-considered, \\n\\nbut most seemed to promise rich rewards in knowledge \\n\\nand practical application. From Jejene\\'s search for the \\n\\nUniversal Nostrum to Bodalk\\'s reckless assault on orthodox \\n\\ngeometries, the collegium\\'s activities exhibited a healthy \\n\\nhankering to pry open Nature\\'s private files, locked since \\n\\nmankind had burned its institutional memories and \\n\\ncondemned itself to cultural amnesia more than a \\n\\nmillennium ago. \\n\\n\"In addition to these studies, Thon Maho Mahh is heading a \\n\\nproject which seeks further information about the origin of \\n\\nthe human species. Since this is primarily an \\n\\narchaeological task, he asked me to search your library for  \\n\\nany suggestive material on the subject, after I complete \\n\\nmy own study here. However, perhaps I\\'d better not dwell \\n\\non this at any length, since it\\'s tending to cause \\n\\ncontroversy with the theologians. But if there are any \\n\\nquestions– \" \\n\\nA young monk who was studying for the priesthood stood \\n\\nup and was recognized by the thon. \\n\\n\"Sir, I was wondering if you were acquainted with the \\n\\nsuggestions of Saint Augustine on the subject?\" \\n\\n\"I am not.\" \\n\\n\"A fourth century bishop and philosopher. He suggested \\n\\nthat in the beginning, God created all things in their \\n\\nthe germinal causes inseminate, as it were, the formless \\n\\nmatter– which then gradually evolved into the more \\n\\ncomplex shapes, and eventually Man. Has this hypothesis \\n\\nbeen considered?\" \\n\\nThe thon\\'s smile was condescending, although he did not \\n\\nopenly brand the proposal childish. \"I\\'m afraid it has not, \\n\\nbut I shall look it up,\" he said, in a tone that indicated he  \\n\\nwould not. \\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said the monk, and sat down meekly. \\n\\n\"Perhaps the most daring research of all, however,\" \\n\\ncontinued the sage, \"is being conducted by my friend Thon \\n\\nEsser Shon. It is an attempt to synthesize living matter. \\n\\nThon Esser hopes to create living protoplasm, using only \\n\\nsix basic ingredients. This work could lead to– yes? You \\n\\nhave a question?\" \\n\\nA monk in the third row had risen and was bowing toward \\n\\nrecognized, with horror, that it was Brother Armbruster, \\n\\nthe librarian. \\n\\n\"If you would do an old man the kindness,\" croaked the \\n\\nmonk, dragging out his words in a plodding monotone. \\n\\n\"This Thou Esser Shon– who limits himself to only six basic \\n\\ningredients– is very interesting. I was wondering– are they \\n\\npermitting him to use both hands?\" \\n\\n\"Why, I– \" The thon paused and frowned.  \\n\\non, \"whether this remarkable feat is to be performed from \\n\\nthe sitting, standing, or prone position? Or perhaps on \\n\\nhorseback while playing two trumpets?\" \\n\\nhis feet. \\n\\n\"Brother Armbruster, you have been warned. You are \\n\\nexcommunicated from the common table until you make \\n\\nsatisfaction. You may wait in the Lady Chapel.\" \\n\\nThe librarian bowed again and stole quietly out of the hail, \\n\\nhis carriage humble, but his eyes triumphant. The abbot \\n\\nmurmured apologetically to the scholar, but the thon\\'s \\n\\nglance was suddenly chilly. \\n\\n\"In conclusion,\" he said, \"a brief outline of what the world \\n\\ncan expect, in my opinion, from the intellectual revolution \\n\\nthat\\'s just beginning.\" Eyes burning, he looked around at \\n\\nthem, and his voice changed from casual to fervent \\n\\nrhythms. \"Ignorance has been our king. Since the death of \\n\\nempire, he sits unchallenged on the throne of Man. His \\n\\ndynasty is age-old. His right to rule is now considered \\n\\nlegitimate. Past sages have affirmed it. They did nothing to \\n\\nunseat him.  \\n\\n\"Tomorrow, a new prince shall rule. Men of understanding, \\n\\nmen of science shall stand behind his throne, and the \\n\\nuniverse will come to know his might. His name is Truth. \\n\\nHis empire shall encompass the Earth. And the mastery of \\n\\nMan over the Earth shall be renewed. A century from now, \\n\\nmen will fly through the air in mechanical birds. Metal \\n\\ncarriages will race along roads of man-made stone. There \\n\\nwill be buildings of thirty stories, ships that go under the \\n\\nsea, machines to perform all works. \\n\\n\"And how will this come to pass?\" He paused and lowered \\n\\nhis voice. \"In the same way all change comes to pass, I \\n\\nfear. And I am sorry it is so. It will come to pass by \\n\\nviolence and upheaval, by flame and by fury, for no \\n\\nchange comes calmly over the world.\" \\n\\nHe glanced around, for a soft murmur arose from the \\n\\ncommunity. \\n\\n\"It will be so. We do not will it so. \\n\\n\"But why?\" \\n\\n\"Ignorance is king. Many would not profit by his \\n\\nabdication. Many enrich themselves by means of his dark \\n\\nmonarchy. They are his Court, and in his name they \\n\\ndefraud and govern, enrich themselves and perpetuate \\n\\ntheir power. Even literacy they fear, for the written word is \\n\\nanother channel of communication that might cause their \\n\\nenemies to become united. Their weapons are keenhoned, \\n\\nand they use them with skill. They will press the battle \\n\\nupon the world when their interests are threatened, and \\n\\nthe violence which follows will last until the structure of \\n\\nsociety as it now exists is leveled to rubble, and a new \\n\\nsociety emerges. I am sorry. But that is how I see it.\" \\n\\nThe words brought a new pall over the room. Dom Paulo\\'s \\n\\nhopes sank, for the prophecy gave form to the scholar\\'s \\n\\nprobable outlook. Thon Taddeo knew the military \\n\\nambitions of his monarch. He had a choice: to approve of \\n\\nthem, to disapprove of them, or to regard them as \\n\\nimpersonal phenomena beyond his control like a flood, \\n\\nfamine, or whirlwind. \\n\\nEvidently, then, he accepted them as inevitable– to avoid \\n\\nhaving to make a moral judgment. Let there be blood, iron \\n\\nand weeping. . . \\n\\nHow could such a man thus evade his own conscience and \\n\\ndisavow his responsibility– and so easily! the abbot \\n\\nstormed to himself. \\n\\nBut then the words came back to him. For in those days, \\n\\nthe Lord God had suffered the wise men to know the \\n\\nmeans by which the world itself might be destroyed. . . \\n\\nHe also suffered them to know how it might be saved, and, \\n\\nas always, let them choose for themselves. And perhaps \\n\\nthey had chosen as Thon Taddeo chooses. To wash their \\n\\nhands before the multitude. Look you to it. Lest they \\n\\nthemselves be crucified. \\n\\nAnd they had been crucified anyhow. Without dignity. \\n\\nAlways for anybody anyhow is to get nailed on it and hang \\n\\non it and if you drop off they beat. \\n\\nThere was sudden silence. The scholar had stopped \\n\\ntalking. \\n\\nThe abbot blinked around the hall. Half the community was \\n\\nstaring toward the entrance. At first his eyes could make \\n\\nout nothing. \\n\\n\"What is it?\" he whispered to Gault. \\n\\nlooks like– No, he wouldn\\'t– \" \\n\\nDom Paulo arose and moved to the front of the dais to \\n\\nstare at the faintly defined shape in the shadows. Then he \\n\\ncalled out to it softly. \\n\\n\"Benjamin?\" \\n\\nThe figure stirred. It drew its shawl tighter about spindly \\n\\nshoulders and hobbled slowly into the light. It stopped \\n\\nagain, muttering to itself as it looked around the room; \\n\\nthen its eyes found the scholar at the lectern. \\n\\nLeaning on a crooked staff, the old apparition hobbled \\n\\nslowly toward the lectern, never taking its eyes from the \\n\\nman who stood behind it. Thon Taddeo looked humorously \\n\\nperplexed at first, but when no one stirred or spoke, he \\n\\nseemed to lose color as the decrepit vision came near him. \\n\\nThe face of the bearded antiquity blazed with hopeful \\n\\nferocity of some compelling passion that burned more \\n\\nfuriously in him than the life principle long since due to \\n\\ndepart. \\n\\nHe came close to the lectern, paused. His eyes twitched \\n\\nHe reached out one trembling hand toward the scholar. \\n\\nThe thon drew back with a snort of revulsion. \\n\\nThe hermit was agile. He vaulted to the dais, dodged the \\n\\nlectern, and seized the scholar\\'s arm. \\n\\n\"What madness– \" \\n\\nBenjamin kneaded the arm while he stared hopefully into \\n\\nthe scholar\\'s eyes. \\n\\nHis face clouded. The glow died. He dropped the arm. A \\n\\ngreat keening sigh came from the dry old lungs as hope \\n\\nvanished. The eternally knowing smirk of the Old Jew of \\n\\nthe Mountain returned to his face. He turned to the \\n\\ncommunity, spread his hands, shrugged eloquently. \\n\\n\"It\\'s still not Him,\" he told them sourly, then hobbled \\n\\naway. \\n\\nAfterwards, there was little formality. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter  \\n\\nChapter Twenty-one  \\n\\nIt was during the tenth week of Thou Taddeo\\'s visit that \\n\\nthe messenger brought the black news. The head of the \\n\\nruling dynasty of Laredo had demanded that Texarkanan \\n\\ntroops be evacuated forthwith from the realm. The King \\n\\ndied of poison that night, and a state of war was \\n\\nproclaimed between the states of Laredo and Texarkana. \\n\\nThe war would be short-lived. It could with assurance be \\n\\nassumed that the war had ended the day after it had \\n\\nbegun, and that Hannegan now controlled all lands and \\n\\npeoples from the Red River to the Rio Grande. \\n\\nThat much had been expected, but not the accompanying \\n\\nnews. \\n\\nHannegan II, by Grace of God Mayor, Viceroy of \\n\\nTexarkana, Defender of the Faith, and Vaquero Supreme of \\n\\nthe Plains, had, after finding Monsignor Marcus Apollo to \\n\\nbe guilty of \"treason\" and espionage, caused the papal \\n\\nnuncio to be hanged, and then, while still alive to be cut \\n\\ndown, drawn, quartered, and flayed, as an example to \\n\\nanyone else who might try to undermine the Mayor\\'s state. \\n\\nIn pieces, the priest\\'s carcass had been thrown to the \\n\\ndogs. \\n\\nThe messenger hardly needed to add that Texarkana was  \\n\\nunder absolute interdict by a papal decree which contained \\n\\ncertain vague but ominous allusions to Regnans in \\n\\nExcelsis, a sixteenth century bull ordering a monarch \\n\\ndeposed. There was no news of Hannegan\\'s \\n\\ncountermeasures, as yet. \\n\\nOn the Plains, the Laredan forces would now have to fight \\n\\ntheir way back home through the nomad tribes, only to lay \\n\\ndown their arms at their own borders, for their nation and \\n\\ntheir kin were hostage. \\n\\n\"A tragic affair!\" said Thou Taddeo, with an apparent \\n\\ndegree of sincerity. \"Because of my nationality, I offer to \\n\\nleave at once.\" \\n\\n\"Why?\" Dom Paulo asked. \"You don\\'t approve of \\n\\nHannegan\\'s actions, do you?\" \\n\\nThe scholar hesitated, then shook his head. He looked \\n\\naround to make certain no one overheard them. \\n\\n\"Personally, I condemn them. But in public– \" He \\n\\nshrugged. \"There is the collegium to think of. If it were \\n\\nonly a question of my own neck, well– \" \\n\\n\"I understand.\"  \\n\\n\"May I venture an opinion in confidence?\" \\n\\n\"Of course.\" \\n\\n\"Then someone ought to warn New Rome against making \\n\\nidle threats. Hannegan\\'s not above crucifying several \\n\\ndozen Marcus Apollos.\" \\n\\n\"Then some new martyrs will attain Heaven; New Rome \\n\\ndoesn\\'t make idle threats.\" \\n\\nThe thon sighed. \"I supposed that you\\'d look at it that \\n\\nway. But I renew my offer to leave.\" \\n\\n\"Nonsense. Whatever your nationality, your common \\n\\nhumanity makes you welcome.\" \\n\\nBut a rift had appeared. The scholar kept his own company \\n\\nafterward, seldom conversing with the monks. His \\n\\nrelationship with Brother Kornhoer became noticeably \\n\\nformal, although the inventor spent an hour or two each \\n\\nday in servicing and inspecting the dynamo and the lamp, \\n\\nand keeping himself informed concerning the progress of \\n\\nthe thon\\'s work, which was now proceeding with unusual  \\n\\nhaste. The officers seldom ventured outside the \\n\\nguesthouse. \\n\\nThere were hints of an exodus from the region. Disturbing \\n\\nrumors kept coming from the Plains. In the village of Sanly \\n\\nBowitts, people began discovering reasons to depart \\n\\nsuddenly on pilgrimages or to visit in other lands. Even the \\n\\nbeggars and vagrants were getting out of town. As always, \\n\\nthe merchants and artisans were faced with the unpleasant \\n\\nchoice of abandoning their property to burglars and looters \\n\\nor staying with it to see it looted. \\n\\nA citizens\\' committee headed by the mayor of the village \\n\\nvisited the abbey to request sanctuary for the townspeople \\n\\nin the event of invasion. \"My final offer,\" said the abbot, \\n\\nafter several hours of argument, \"is this: we will take in all \\n\\nthe women, children, invalids, and aged, without question. \\n\\nBut as for men capable of bearing arms, we\\'ll consider \\n\\neach case individually, and we may turn some of them \\n\\naway.\" \\n\\n\"Why?\" the mayor demanded. \\n\\n\"That should be obvious, even to you!\" Dom Paulo said  \\n\\nsharply. \"We may come under attack ourselves, but unless  \\n\\nwe\\'re directly attacked, we\\'re going to stay out of it. I\\'ll \\n\\nnot let this place be used by anybody as a garrison from \\n\\nwhich to launch a counterattack if the only attack is on the \\n\\nvillage itself. So in case of males able to bear arms, we\\'ll \\n\\nhave to insist on a pledge– to defend the abbey under our \\n\\norders. And we\\'ll decide in individual cases whether a \\n\\npledge is trustworthy or not.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s unfair!\" howled a committeeman. \"You\\'ll discriminate– \\n\\n\" \\n\\n\"Only against those who can\\'t be trusted. What\\'s the \\n\\nmatter? Were you hoping to hide a reserve force here? \\n\\nWell, it won\\'t be allowed. You\\'re not going to plant any \\n\\npart of a town militia out here. That\\'s final.\" \\n\\nUnder the circumstances, the committee could not refuse \\n\\nany help offered. There was no further argument. Dom \\n\\nPaulo meant to take in anyone, when the time came, but \\n\\nfor the present he meant to forestall plans by the village to \\n\\ninvolve the abbey in military planning. Later there would \\n\\nbe officers from Denver with similar requests; they would \\n\\nbe less interested in saving life than in saving their political \\n\\nregime. He intended to give them a similar answer. The \\n\\nabbey had been built as a fortress of faith and knowledge,  \\n\\nand he meant to preserve it as such. \\n\\nThe desert began to crawl with wanderers out of the east. \\n\\nTraders, trappers, and herdsmen, in moving west, brought \\n\\nnews from the Plains. The cattle plague was sweeping like \\n\\nwildfire among the herds of the nomads; famine seemed \\n\\nimminent. Laredo\\'s forces had suffered a mutinous \\n\\ncleavage since the fall of the Laredan dynasty. Part of \\n\\nthem were returning to their homeland as ordered, while \\n\\nthe others set out under a grim vow to march on \\n\\nTexarkana and not stop until they took the head of \\n\\nHannegan II or died in trying. Weakened by the split, the \\n\\nLaredans were being wiped out gradually by the \\n\\nhit-and-run assaults from Mad Bear\\'s warriors who were \\n\\nthirsty for vengeance against those who had brought the \\n\\nplague. It was rumored that Hannegan had generously \\n\\noffered to make Mad Bear\\'s people his protected \\n\\ndependents, if they would swear fealty to \"civilized\" law, \\n\\naccept his officers into their councils, and embrace the \\n\\nChristian Faith. \"Submit or starve\" was the choice which \\n\\nfate and Hannegan offered the herdsman peoples. Many \\n\\nwould choose to starve before giving allegiance to an \\n\\nagrarian-merchant state. Hongan Os was said to be roaring \\n\\nhis defiance southward, eastward, and heavenward; he \\n\\naccomplished the latter by burning one shaman a day to \\n\\npunish the tribal gods for betraying him. He threatened to \\n\\nhis enemies. \\n\\nIt was during the brief visit of a party of shepherds that \\n\\nthe Poet vanished from the abbey. Thon Taddeo was the \\n\\nto inquire about the versifying vagrant. \\n\\nDom Paulo\\'s face wrinkled in surprise. \"Are you certain \\n\\nhe\\'s moved out?\" he asked. \"He often spends a few days in \\n\\nthe village, or goes over to the mesa for an argument with \\n\\nBenjamin.\" \\n\\ngone from his room.\" \\n\\nThe abbot made a wry mouth. \"When the Poet leaves, \\n\\nthat\\'s a bad sign. By the way, if he\\'s really missing, then I \\n\\nwould advise you to take an immediate inventory of your \\n\\nown belongings.\" \\n\\nThe thon looked thoughtful. \"So that\\'s where my boots– \" \\n\\n\"No doubt.\"  \\n\\n\"I set them out to be polished. They weren\\'t returned. That \\n\\nwas the same day he tried to batter down my door.\" \\n\\n\"Batter down– who, the Poet?\" \\n\\nThon Taddeo chuckled. \"I\\'m afraid I\\'ve been having a little \\n\\nsport with him. I have his glass eye. You remember the \\n\\nnight he left it on the refectory table?\" \\n\\n\"Yes.\" \\n\\n\"I picked it up.\" \\n\\nThe thon opened his pouch, groped in it for a moment, \\n\\nthen laid the Poet\\'s eyeball on the abbot\\'s desk. \"He knew \\n\\nI had it, but I kept denying it. But we\\'ve had sport with \\n\\nhim ever since, even to creating rumors that it was really \\n\\nthe long-lost eyeball of the Bayring idol and ought to be \\n\\nreturned to the museum. He became quite frantic after a \\n\\ntime. Of course I had meant to return it before we go \\n\\nhome. Do you suppose he\\'ll return after we leave?\" \\n\\n\"I doubt it,\" said the abbot, shuddering slightly as he \\n\\nglanced at the orb. \"But I\\'ll keep it for him, if you like. \\n\\nAlthough it\\'s just as probable that he\\'d turn up in \\n\\nTexarkana looking for it there. He claims it\\'s a potent \\n\\ntalisman.\" \\n\\n\"How so?\" \\n\\nDom Paulo smiled. \"He says he can see much better when \\n\\nhe\\'s wearing it.\" \\n\\n\"What nonsense!\" The thon paused; ever ready, \\n\\napparently, to give any sort of outlandish premise at least \\n\\na moment\\'s consideration, he added: \"Isn\\'t it nonsense– \\n\\nunless filling the empty socket somehow affects the \\n\\nmuscles of both sockets. Is that what he claims?\" \\n\\n\"He just swears he can\\'t see as well without it. He claims \\n\\nhe has to have it for the perception of \\'true meanings\\'– \\n\\nalthough it gives him blinding headaches when he wears it. \\n\\nBut one never knows whether the Poet is speaking fact, \\n\\nfancy, or allegory. If fancy is clever enough, I doubt that \\n\\nthe Poet would admit a difference between fancy and fact.\" \\n\\nThe thon smiled quizzically. \"Outside my door the other \\n\\nday, he yelled that I needed it more than he did. That \\n\\nseems to suggest that he thinks of it as being, in itself, a \\n\\npotent fetish– good for anyone. I wonder why.\" \\n\\n\"He said you needed it? Oh ho!\" \\n\\n\"What amuses you?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry. He probably meant it as an insult. I\\'d better not \\n\\ntry to explain the Poet\\'s insult, it might make me seem a \\n\\nparty to them.\" \\n\\n\"Not at all. I\\'m curious.\" \\n\\nThe abbot glanced at the image of Saint Leibowitz in the \\n\\ncorner of the room. \"The Poet used the eyeball as a \\n\\nrunning joke,\" he explained. \"When he wanted to make a \\n\\ndecision, or to think something over, or to debate a point, \\n\\nhe\\'d put the glass eye in the socket. He\\'d take it out again \\n\\nwhen he saw something that displeased him, when he was \\n\\npretending to overlook something, or when he wanted to \\n\\nplay stupid. When he wore it, his manner changed. The \\n\\nbrothers began calling it \\'the Poet\\'s conscience,\\' and he \\n\\nwent along with the joke. He gave little lectures and \\n\\ndemonstrations on the advantages of a removable \\n\\nconscience. He\\'d pretend some frantic compulsion \\n\\npossessed him– something trivial, usually– like a \\n\\ncompulsion aimed at a bottle of wine. \\n\\n\"Wearing his eye, he\\'d stroke the wine bottle, lick his lips, \\n\\npant and moan, then jerk his hand away. Finally it would \\n\\npossess him again. He\\'d grab the bottle, pour about a \\n\\nthimbleful in a cup and gloat over it for a second. But then \\n\\nconscience would fight back, and he\\'d throw the cup across \\n\\nthe room. Soon he\\'d be leering at the wine bottle again, \\n\\nand start to moan and slobber, but fighting the compulsion \\n\\nanyhow– \" the abbot chuckled in spite of himself \"– \\n\\nhideous to watch. Finally, when he became exhausted, \\n\\nhe\\'d pluck out his glass eye. Once the eye was out, he\\'d \\n\\nsuddenly relax. The compulsion stopped being compulsive. \\n\\nCool and arrogant then, he\\'d pick up the bottle, look \\n\\naround and laugh. \\'I\\'m going to do it anyhow,\\' he\\'d say. \\n\\nThen, while everyone was expecting him to drink it, he\\'d \\n\\nput on a beatific smile and pour the whole bottle over his \\n\\nown head. The advantage of a removable conscience, you \\n\\nsee.\" \\n\\n\"So he thinks I need it more than he does.\" \\n\\nDom Paulo shrugged. \"He\\'s only the Poet-sirrah!\"  \\n\\nThe scholar puffed a breath of amusement. He prodded at \\n\\nthe vitreous spheroid and rolled it across the table with his \\n\\nthumb. Suddenly he laughed. \"I rather like that. I think I \\n\\nknow who does need it more than the Poet. Perhaps I\\'ll \\n\\nkeep it after all.\" He picked it up, tossed it, caught it, and \\n\\nglanced doubtfully at the abbot. \\n\\nPaulo merely shrugged again. \\n\\nThon Taddeo dropped the eye back in his pouch. \"He can \\n\\nhave it if he ever comes to claim it. But by the way, I \\n\\nmeant to tell you: my work is nearly finished here. We\\'ll be \\n\\nleaving in a very few days.\" \\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you worried about the fighting on the Plains?\" \\n\\nThou Taddeo frowned at the wall. \"We\\'re to camp at a \\n\\nbutte, about a week\\'s ride to the east from here. A group \\n\\nof, uh– Our escort will meet us there.\" \\n\\n\"I do hope,\" said the abbot, relishing the polite bit of \\n\\nsavagery, \"that your escort-group hasn\\'t reversed its \\n\\npolitical allegiance since you made the arrangements. It\\'s \\n\\ngetting harder to tell foes from allies these days.\" \\n\\nThe thou reddened. \"Especially if they come from \\n\\nTexarkana, you mean?\" \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t say that.\" \\n\\n\"Let\\'s be frank with each other, Father. I can\\'t fight the \\n\\nprince who makes my work possible– no matter what I \\n\\nthink of his policies or his politics. I appear to support him, \\n\\nsuperficially, or at least to overlook him– for the sake of \\n\\nthe collegium. If he extends his lands, the collegium may \\n\\nincidentally profit. If the collegium prospers, mankind will \\n\\nprofit from our work.\" \\n\\n\"The ones who survive, perhaps.\" \\n\\n\"True– but that\\'s always true in any event.\" \\n\\n\"No, no– Twelve centuries ago, not even the survivors \\n\\nprofited. Must we start down that road again?\" \\n\\nThon Taddeo shrugged. \"What can I do about it?\" he asked \\n\\ncrossly. \"Hannegan is prince, not I.\" \\n\\n\"But you promise to begin restoring Man\\'s control over \\n\\nNature. But who will govern the use of the power to control \\n\\nnatural forces? Who will use it? To what end? How will you \\n\\nhold him in check? Such decisions can still be made. But if \\n\\nyou and your group don\\'t make them now, others will soon \\n\\nmake them for you. Mankind will profit, you say. By whose \\n\\nsufferance? The sufferance of a prince who signs his letters \\n\\nX? Or do you really believe that your collegium can stay \\n\\naloof from his ambitions when he begins to find out that \\n\\nyou\\'re valuable to him?\" \\n\\nDom Paulo had not expected to convince him. But it was \\n\\nwith a heavy heart that the abbot noticed the plodding \\n\\nthe patience of a man listening to an argument which he \\n\\nhad long ago refuted to his own satisfaction. \\n\\n\"What you really suggest,\" said the scholar, \"is that we \\n\\nwait a little while. That we dissolve the collegium, or move \\n\\nit to the desert, and somehow– with no gold and silver of \\n\\nour own– revive an experimental and theoretical science in \\n\\nsome slow hard way, and tell nobody. That we save it all \\n\\nup for the day when Man is good and pure and holy and \\n\\nwise.\" \\n\\n\"That is not what I meant– \" \\n\\n\"That is not what you meant to say, but it is what your \\n\\nsaying means. Keep science cloistered, don\\'t try to apply \\n\\nit, don\\'t try to do anything about it until men are holy. \\n\\nWell, it won\\'t work. You\\'ve been doing it here in this abbey \\n\\nfor generations.\" \\n\\n\"We haven\\'t withheld anything.\" \\n\\n\"You haven\\'t withheld it; but you sat on it so quietly, \\n\\nnobody knew it was here, and you did nothing with it.\" \\n\\nBrief anger flared in the old priest\\'s eyes. \"It\\'s time you \\n\\nmet our founder, I think,\" he growled, pointing to the \\n\\nwoodcarving in the corner. \"He was a scientist like yourself \\n\\nbefore the world went mad and he ran for sanctuary. He \\n\\nfounded this Order to save what could be saved of the \\n\\nrecords of the last civilization. \\'Saved\\' from what, and for \\n\\nwhat? Look where he\\'s standing– see the kindling? the \\n\\nbooks? That\\'s how little the world wanted your science \\n\\nthen, and for centuries afterward. So he died for our sake. \\n\\nWhen they drenched him with fuel oil, legend says he \\n\\nasked them for a cup of it. They thought he mistook it for \\n\\nwater, so they laughed and gave him a cup. He blessed it \\n\\nand– some say the oil changed to wine when he blessed \\n\\ndrank it before they hung him and set him on fire. Shall I \\n\\nread you a list of our martyrs? Shall I name all the battles \\n\\nwe have fought to keep these records intact? All the monks \\n\\nblinded in the copyroom? for your sake? Yet you say we \\n\\ndid nothing with it, withheld it by silence.\" \\n\\n\"Not intentionally,\" the scholar said, \"but in effect you did– \\n\\nand for the very motives you imply should be mine. If you \\n\\ntry to save wisdom until the world is wise, Father, the \\n\\nworld will never have it.\" \\n\\n\"I can see the misunderstanding is basic!\" the abbot said \\n\\ngruffly. \"To serve God first, or to serve Hannegan first– \\n\\nthat\\'s your choice.\" \\n\\n\"I have little choice, then,\" answered the thon. \"Would you \\n\\nhave me work for the Church?\" The scorn in his voice was \\n\\nunmistakable. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Twenty-two  \\n\\nIt was Thursday within the Octave of All Saints. In \\n\\npreparation for departure, the thon and his party sorted \\n\\ntheir notes and records in the basement. He had attracted \\n\\na small monastic audience, and a spirit of friendliness \\n\\nprevailed as the time to leave drew near. Overhead, the \\n\\narc lamp still sputtered and glared, filling the ancient \\n\\nlibrary with blue-white harshness while the team of novices \\n\\npumped wearily at the hand-powered dynamo. The \\n\\ninexperience of the novice who sat atop the ladder to keep \\n\\nthe arc gap adjusted caused the light to flicker erratically; \\n\\nhe had replaced the previous skilled operator who was at \\n\\npresent confined to the infirmary with wet dressings over \\n\\nhis eyes. \\n\\nThon Taddeo had been answering questions about his work \\n\\nwith less reticence than usual, no longer worried, \\n\\napparently, about such controversial subjects as the \\n\\nrefrangible property of light, or the ambitions of Thon \\n\\nEsser Shon. \\n\\n\"Now unless this hypothesis is meaningless,\" he was \\n\\nsaying, \"it must be possible to confirm it in some way by \\n\\nobservation. I set up the hypothesis with the help of some \\n\\nnew– or rather, some very old– mathematical forms \\n\\nsuggested by our study of your Memorabilia. The \\n\\nhypothesis seems to offer a simpler explanation of optical \\n\\nphenomena, but frankly, I could think of no way to test it \\n\\nat first. That\\'s where your Brother Kornhoer proved a \\n\\nhelp.\" He nodded toward the inventor with a smile and \\n\\ndisplayed a sketch of a proposed testing device. \\n\\n\"What is it?\" someone asked after a brief interval of \\n\\nmystificalion. \\n\\n\"Well– this is a pile of glass plates. A beam of sunlight \\n\\nstriking the pile at this angle will be partially reflected and \\n\\npartially transmitted. The reflected part will be polarized. \\n\\nNow we adjust the pile to reflect the beam through this \\n\\nthing, which is Brother Kornhoer\\'s idea, and let the light \\n\\nfall on this second pile of glass plates. The second pile is \\n\\nset at just the right angle to reflect almost all of the \\n\\nthrough the glass, we\\'d scarcely see the light. All this has \\n\\nbeen tried. But now if my hypothesis is correct, closing this \\n\\nswitch on Brother Kornhoer\\'s field coil here should cause a \\n\\nsudden brightening of the transmitted light. If it doesn\\'t– \" \\n\\nhe shrugged \"– then we throw out the hypothesis.\" \\n\\n\"You might throw out the coil instead,\" Brother Kornhoer \\n\\nsuggested modestly. \"I\\'m not sure it\\'ll produce a strong \\n\\nenough field.\" \\n\\n\"I am. You have an instinct for these things. I find it much \\n\\neasier to develop an abstract theory than to construct a \\n\\npractical way to test it. But you have a remarkable gift for \\n\\nseeing everything in terms of screws, wires, and lenses, \\n\\nwhile I\\'m still thinking abstract symbols.\" \\n\\n\"But the abstractions would never occur to me in the first \\n\\nplace, Thon Taddeo.\" \\n\\n\"We would make a good team, Brother. I wish you would \\n\\njoin us at the collegium, at least for a while. Do you think \\n\\nyour abbot would grant you leave?\" \\n\\n\"I would not presume to guess,\" the inventor murmured, \\n\\nsuddenly uncomfortable. \\n\\nThon Taddeo turned to the others. \"I\\'ve heard mention of \\n\\n\\'brothers on leave.\\' Isn\\'t it true that some members of \\n\\nyour community are employed elsewhere temporarily?\" \\n\\n\"Only a very few, Thon Taddeo,\" said a young priest.  \\n\\n\"Formerly, the Order supplied clerks, scribes, and \\n\\nsecretaries to the secular clergy, and to both royal and \\n\\necclesiastical courts. But that was during the times of most \\n\\nsevere hardship and poverty here at the abbey. Brothers \\n\\nworking on leave have kept the rest of us from starving at \\n\\ntimes. But that\\'s no longer necessary, and it\\'s seldom \\n\\ndone. Of course, we have a few brothers studying in New \\n\\nRome now, but– \" \\n\\n\"That\\'s it!\" said the thon with sudden enthusiasm. \"A \\n\\nscholarship at the collegium for you, Brother. I was talking \\n\\nto your abbot, and– \" \\n\\n\"Yes?\" asked the young priest. \\n\\n\"Well, while we disagree on a few things, I can understand \\n\\nhis point of view. I was thinking that an exchange of \\n\\nscholarships might improve relations. There would be a \\n\\nstipend, of course, and I\\'m sure your abbot could put that \\n\\nto good use.\" \\n\\nBrother Kornhoer inclined his head but said nothing. \\n\\n\"Come now!\" The scholar laughed. \"You don\\'t seem \\n\\npleased by the invitation, Brother.\" \\n\\n\"I am flattered, of course. But such matters are not for me \\n\\nto decide.\" \\n\\n\"Well, I understand that, of course. But I wouldn\\'t dream \\n\\nof asking your abbot if the idea displeased you.\" \\n\\nBrother Kornhoer hesitated. \"My vocation is to Religion,\" \\n\\nhe said at last, \"that is– to a life of prayer. We think of our \\n\\nwork as a kind of prayer too. But that– \" he gestured \\n\\ntoward his dynamo \"– for me seems more like play. \\n\\nHowever, if Dom Paulo were to send me– \" \\n\\n\"You\\'d reluctantly go,\" the scholar finished sourly. \"I\\'m \\n\\nsure I could get the collegium to send your abbot at least a \\n\\nhundred gold hannegans a year while you were with us, \\n\\n\"Pardon me, did I say something wrong?\" \\n\\nHalfway down the stairs, the abbot paused to survey the \\n\\ngroup in the basement. Several blank faces were turned \\n\\ntoward him. After a few seconds Thou Taddeo noticed the \\n\\nabbot\\'s presence and nodded pleasantly. \\n\\n\"We were just speaking of you, Father,\" he said. \"If you  \\n\\nheard, perhaps I should explain– \"  \\n\\nDom Paulo shook his head. \"That\\'s not necessary.\"  \\n\\n\"But I would like to discuss– \"  \\n\\n\"Can it wait? I\\'m in a hurry this minute.\"  \\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said the scholar.  \\n\\n\"I\\'ll be back shortly.\" He climbed the stairs again. Father  \\n\\nGault was waiting for him in the courtyard.  \\n\\n\"Have they heard about it yet, Domne?\" the prior asked  \\n\\ngrimly. \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t ask, but I\\'m sure they haven\\'t,\" Dom Paulo \\n\\nanswered. \"They\\'re just making silly conversation down \\n\\nthere. Something about taking Brother K back to \\n\\nTexarkana with them.\" \\n\\n\"Then they haven\\'t heard, that\\'s certain.\" \\n\\n\"Yes. Now where is he?\"  \\n\\n\"In the guesthouse, Domne. The medic\\'s with him. He\\'s \\n\\ndelirious.\" \\n\\n\"How many of the brothers know he\\'s here?\" \\n\\n\"About four. We were singing None when he came in the \\n\\ngate.\" \\n\\n\"Tell those four not to mention it to anyone. Then join our \\n\\nguests in the basement. Just be pleasant, and don\\'t let \\n\\nthem know.\" \\n\\n\"But shouldn\\'t they be told before they leave, Domne?\" \\n\\n\"Of course. But let them get ready first. You know it won\\'t \\n\\nstop them from going back. So to minimize \\n\\nembarrassment, let\\'s wait until the last minute to tell \\n\\nthem. Now, do you have it with you?\" \\n\\n\"No, I left it with his papers in the guesthouse.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ll go see him. Now, warn the brothers, and join our \\n\\nguests.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, Domne.\"  \\n\\nThe abbot hiked toward the guesthouse. As he entered, \\n\\nBrother Pharmacist was just leaving the fugitive\\'s room. \\n\\n\"Will he live, Brother?\" \\n\\n\"I cannot know, Domne. Mistreatment, starvation, \\n\\nexposure, fever– if God wills it– \" He shrugged. \\n\\n\"May I speak to him?\" \\n\\nabbot entered the room and softly closed the door behind \\n\\nhim. \\n\\n\"Brother Claret?\" \\n\\n\"Not again,\" gasped the man on the bed. \"For the love of \\n\\nGod, not again– I\\'ve told you all I know. I betrayed him. \\n\\nNow just let me– be.\" \\n\\nDom Paulo looked down with pity on the secretary to the \\n\\nlate Marcus Apollo. He glanced at the scribe\\'s hands. There \\n\\nwere only festering sores where the fingernails had been. \\n\\nThe abbot shuddered and turned to the small table near  \\n\\neffects, he quickly found the crudely printed document \\n\\nwhich the fugitive had brought with him from the east:\\n\\n HANNEGAN THE MAYOR, by Grace of God: Sovereign of\\n\\n Texarkana, Emperor of Laredo, Defender of the Faith, \\n\\nDoctor of Laws, Clans Chief of the Nomads, and Vaquero \\n\\nSupreme of the Plains, to ALL BISHOPS, PRIESTS, AND \\n\\nPRELATES of the Church throughout Our Rightful Realm, \\n\\nGreetings & TAKE HEED, for it is the LAW, viz & to wit:\\n\\n (1) Whereas a certain foreign prince, one Benedict XXII, \\n\\nBishop of New Rome, presuming to assert an authority \\n\\nwhich is not rightly his over the clergy of this nation, has \\n\\ndared to attempt, first, to place the Texarkanan Church \\n\\nunder a sentence of interdict, and, later, to suspend this \\n\\nsentence, thereby creating great confusion and spiritual \\n\\nneglect among all the faithful, We, the only legitimate ruler \\n\\nover the Church in this realm, acting in concord with a \\n\\ncouncil of bishops and clergy, hereby declare to Our loyal \\n\\npeople that the aforesaid prince and bishop, Benedict XXII, \\n\\nis a heretic, simoniac, murderer, sodomite, and atheist, \\n\\nunworthy of any recognition by\\n\\n Holy Church in lands of Our kingdom, empire, or \\n\\nprotectorate. Who serves him serves not Us. \\n\\n(2) Be it known, therefore, that both the decree of interdict \\n\\nand the decree suspending it are hereby QUASHED, \\n\\nANNULLED, DECLARED VOID AND OF NO CONSEQUENCE, \\n\\nfor they were of no original validity. . . \\n\\nDom Paulo glanced at the rest of it only briefly. There was \\n\\nno need to read further. The mayoral TAKE HEED ordered \\n\\nthe licensing of the Texarkanan clergy, made the \\n\\nadministration of the Sacraments by unlicensed persons a \\n\\ncrime under the law, and made an oath of supreme \\n\\nallegiance to the Mayorality a condition for licensing and \\n\\nrecognition. It was signed not only with the Mayor\\'s mark, \\n\\nbut also by several \"bishops\" whose names were unfamiliar \\n\\nto the abbot. \\n\\nHe tossed the document back on the table and sat down \\n\\nbeside the bed. The fugitive\\'s eyes were open, but he only \\n\\nstared at the ceiling and panted. \\n\\n\"Brother Claret?\" he asked gently. \"Brother. . .\" \\n\\nIn the basement, the scholar\\'s eyes had come alight with \\n\\nthe brash exuberance of one specialist invading the field of \\n\\nanother specialist for the sake of straightening out the \\n\\nwhole region of confusion. \"As a matter of fact, yes!\" he \\n\\nsaid in response to a novice\\'s question. \"I did locate one \\n\\nsource here that should, I think, be of interest to Thon \\n\\nhe the one who\\'s, uh, trying to correct Genesis?\" Father \\n\\nGault asked wryly. \\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s– \" the scholar broke off with a startled glance \\n\\nat Gault. \\n\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" the priest said with a chuckle. \"Many of \\n\\nus feel that Genesis is more or less allegorical. What have \\n\\nyou found?\" \\n\\n\"We located one pre-Diluvian fragment that suggests a \\n\\nvery revolutionary concept, as I see it. If I interpret the \\n\\nfragment correctly, Man was not created until shortly \\n\\nbefore the fall of the last civilization.\" \\n\\n\"Wh-a-at? Then where did civilization come from?\"  \\n\\n\"Not from humanity. It was developed by a preceding race \\n\\nwhich became extinct during the Diluvium Ignis.\" \\n\\n\"But Holy Scripture goes back thousands of years before \\n\\nthe Diluvium!\" \\n\\nThon Taddeo remained meaningfully silent. \\n\\n\"You are proposing,\" said Gault, suddenly dismayed, \"that \\n\\nwe are not the descendents of Adam? not related to \\n\\nhistorical humanity?\" \\n\\n\"Wait! I only offer the conjecture that the pre-Deluge race, \\n\\nwhich called itself Man, succeeded in creating life. Shortly \\n\\nbefore the fall of their civilization, they successfully created \\n\\nthe ancestors of present humanity– \\'after their own \\n\\nimage\\'– as a servant species.\" \\n\\n\"But even if you totally reject Revelation, that\\'s a \\n\\ncompletely unnecessary complication under plain common \\n\\nsense!\" Gault complained. \\n\\nThe abbot had come quietly down the stairs. He paused on \\n\\nthe lower landing and listened incredulously. \\n\\n\"It might seem so,\" Thon Taddeo argued, \"until you \\n\\nconsider how many things it would account for. You know \\n\\nmeaningful, it seems to me, if one looks at the \\n\\nSimplification as a rebellion by a created servant species \\n\\nagainst the original creator species, as the fragmentary \\n\\nreference suggests. It would also explain why present-day \\n\\nhumanity seems so inferior to the ancients, why our \\n\\nancestors lapsed into barbarism when their masters were \\n\\nextinct, why– \" \\n\\n\"God have mercy on this house!\" cried Dom Paulo, striding \\n\\ntoward the alcove. \"Spare us, Lord– we know not what we \\n\\ndid.\" \\n\\n\"I should have known,\" the scholar muttered to the world \\n\\nat large. \\n\\nThe old priest advanced like a nemesis on his guest. \"So \\n\\nwe are but creatures of creatures, then, Sir Philosopher? \\n\\nMade by lesser gods than God, and therefore \\n\\nunderstandably less than perfect– through no fault of \\n\\nours, of course.\" \\n\\n\"It is only conjecture but it would account for much,\" the  \\n\\nthon said stiffly, unwilling to retreat. \\n\\n\"And absolve of much, would it not? Man\\'s rebellion \\n\\nagainst his makers was, no doubt, merely justifiable \\n\\ntyrannicide against the infinitely wicked sons of Adam, \\n\\nthen.\" \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t say– \" \\n\\n\"Show me, Sir Philosopher, this amazing reference!\" \\n\\nThou Taddeo hastily shuffled through his notes. The light \\n\\nkept flickering as the novices at the drive-mill strained to \\n\\nlisten. The scholar\\'s small audience had been in a state of \\n\\nshock until the abbot\\'s stormy entrance shattered the \\n\\nnumb dismay of the listeners. Monks whispered among \\n\\nthemselves; someone dared to laugh. \\n\\n\"Here it is,\" Thon Taddeo announced, passing several note \\n\\npages to Dom Paulo. \\n\\nThe abbot gave him a brief glare and began reading. The \\n\\nsilence was awkward. \"You found this over in the \\n\\n\\'Unclassified\\' section, I believe?\" he asked after a few \\n\\nseconds. \\n\\n\"Yes, but– \"  \\n\\nThe abbot went on reading. \\n\\n\"Well, I suppose I should finish packing,\" muttered the \\n\\nrestlessly, as if wishing to slink quietly away. Kornhoer \\n\\nbrooded alone. \\n\\nSatisfied after a few minutes of reading, Dom Paulo \\n\\nhanded the notes abruptly to his prior. \"Lege!\" he \\n\\ncommanded gruffly. \\n\\n\"But what– ?\" \\n\\n\"A fragment of a play, or a dialogue, it seems. I\\'ve seen it \\n\\nbefore. It\\'s something about some people creating some \\n\\nartificial people as slaves. And the slaves revolt against \\n\\ntheir makers. If Thon Taddeo had read the Venerable \\n\\nBoedullus\\' De Inanibus, he would have found that one \\n\\nclassified as \\'probable fable or allegory.\\' But perhaps the \\n\\nthon would care little for the evaluations of the Venerable \\n\\nBoedullus, when he can make his Own.\" \\n\\n\"But what sort of– \"  \\n\\n\"Lege!\"  \\n\\nGault moved aside with the notes. Paulo turned toward the \\n\\nscholar again and spoke politely, informatively, \\n\\nemphatically: \"\\'To the image of God He created them: \\n\\nmale and female He created them.\\'\" \\n\\n\"My remarks were only conjecture,\" said Thon Taddeo. \\n\\n\"Freedom to speculate is necessary– \" \\n\\n\"\\'And the Lord God took Man, and put him into the \\n\\nparadise of pleasure, to dress it, and to keep it. And– \\'\" \\n\\n\"– to the advancement of science. If you would have us \\n\\nhampered by blind adherence, unreasoned dogma, then \\n\\nyou would prefer– \" \\n\\n\"\\'God commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise \\n\\nthou shalt eat; but of the tree of knowledge of good and \\n\\nevil, thou shalt– \\'\" \\n\\n\"– to leave the world in the same black ignorance and \\n\\nsuperstition that you say your Order has struggled– \" \\n\\n\"\\'– not eat. For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, \\n\\nthou shalt die the death.\\'\"  \\n\\n\"– against. Nor could we ever overcome famine, disease, \\n\\nor misbirth, or make the world one bit better than it has \\n\\nbeen for– \" \\n\\n\"\\'And the serpent said to the woman: God doth know that \\n\\nin what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall \\n\\nbe opened, and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and \\n\\nevil.\\'\" \\n\\n\"– twelve centuries, if every direction of speculation is to \\n\\nbe closed off and every new thought denounced– \" \\n\\n\"It never was any better, it never will be any better. It will \\n\\nonly be richer or poorer, sadder but not wiser, until the \\n\\nvery last day.\" \\n\\nThe scholar shrugged helplessly. \"You see? I knew you \\n\\nwould be offended, but you told me– Oh, what\\'s the use? \\n\\nYou have your account of it.\" \\n\\n\"The \\'account\\' that I was quoting, Sir Philosopher, was not \\n\\nan account of the manner of creation, but an account of \\n\\nthe manner of the temptation that led to the Fall. Did that \\n\\nescape you? \\'And the serpent said to the woman– \\'\"  \\n\\n\"Yes, yes, but the freedom to speculate is essential– \" \\n\\n\"No one has tried to deprive you of that. Nor is anyone \\n\\noffended. But to abuse the intellect for reasons of pride, \\n\\nvanity, or escape from responsibility, is the fruit of that \\n\\nsame tree.\" \\n\\n\"You question the honor of my motives?\" asked the thon, \\n\\ndarkening. \\n\\n\"At times I question my own. I accuse you of nothing. But \\n\\nask yourself this: Why do you take delight in leaping to \\n\\nsuch a wild conjecture from so fragile a springboard? Why \\n\\ndo you wish to discredit the past, even to dehumanizing \\n\\nthe last civilization? So that you need not learn from their \\n\\nmistakes? Or can it be that you can\\'t bear being only a \\n\\n\\'rediscoverer,\\' and must feel that you are a \\'creator\\' as \\n\\nwell?\" \\n\\nThe thon hissed an oath. \"These records should be placed \\n\\nirony this is!\" \\n\\nThe light sputtered and went out. The failure was not  \\n\\nmechanical. The novices at the drive-mill had stopped  \\n\\nwork.  \\n\\n\"Bring candles,\" called the abbot.  \\n\\nCandles were brought.  \\n\\n\"Come down,\" Dom Paulo said to the novice atop the  \\n\\nladder. \"And bring that thing with you. Brother Kornhoer?  \\n\\nBrother Korn– \"  \\n\\n\"He stepped into the storeroom a moment ago, Domne.\"  \\n\\n\"Well, call him.\" Dom Paulo turned to the scholar again,  \\n\\nhanding him the document which had been found among  \\n\\nBrother Claret\\'s effects. \"Read, if you can make it out by  \\n\\ncandlelight, Sir Philosopher!\"  \\n\\n\"A mayoral edict?\"  \\n\\n\"Read it and rejoice in your cherished freedom.\"  \\n\\nBrother Kornhoer slipped into the room again. He was  \\n\\ncarrying the heavy crucifix which had been displaced from  \\n\\nthe head of the archway to make room for the novel lamp.  \\n\\nHe handed the cross to Dom Paulo.  \\n\\n\"How did you know I wanted this?\"  \\n\\n\"I just decided it was about time, Domne.\" He shrugged.  \\n\\nThe old man climbed the ladder and replaced the rood on  \\n\\nits iron hook. The corpus glittered with gold by candlelight.  \\n\\nThe abbot turned and called down to his monks. \\n\\n\"Who reads in this alcove henceforth, let him read ad \\n\\nLumina Christi!\" \\n\\nWhen he descended the ladder, Thon Taddeo was already \\n\\ncramming the last of his papers into a large case for later \\n\\nsorting. He glanced warily at the priest but said nothing. \\n\\n\"You read the edict?\"  \\n\\nThe scholar nodded.  \\n\\n\"If, by some unlikely chance, you would like political  \\n\\nasylum here– \"  \\n\\nThe scholar shook his head.  \\n\\n\"Then may I ask you to clarify your remark about placing \\n\\nour records in competent hands?\" \\n\\nThon Taddeo lowered his gaze. \"It was said in the heat of \\n\\nthe moment, Father. I retract it.\" \\n\\n\"But you haven\\'t stopped meaning it. You\\'ve meant it all \\n\\nalong.\" \\n\\nThe thon did not deny it. \\n\\n\"Then it would be futile to repeat my plea for your \\n\\nintercession on our behalf– when your officers tell your \\n\\ncousin what a fine military garrison this abbey would \\n\\nmake. But for his own sake, tell him that when our altars \\n\\nor the Memorabilia have been threatened, our \\n\\npredecessors did not hesitate to resist with the sword.\" He \\n\\npaused. \"Will you be leaving today or tomorrow?\" \\n\\n\"Today I think would be better,\" Thou Taddeo said softly. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll order provisions made ready.\" The abbot turned to go, \\n\\nbut paused to add gently: \"But when you get back, deliver \\n\\na message to your colleagues.\"  \\n\\n\"Of course. Have you written it?\" \\n\\n\"No. Just say that anyone who wishes to study here will be \\n\\nwelcome, in spite of the poor lighting. Thon Maho, \\n\\nespecially. Or Thon Esser Shon with his six ingredients. \\n\\nMen must fumble awhile with error to separate it from \\n\\ntruth, I think– as long as they don\\'t seize the error \\n\\nhungrily because it has a pleasanter taste. Tell them too, \\n\\nmy son, that when the time comes, as it will surely come, \\n\\nthat not only priests but philosophers are in need of \\n\\nsanctuary– tell them our walls are thick out here.\" \\n\\nHe nodded a dismissal to the novices, then, and trudged \\n\\nup the stairs to be alone in his study. For the Fury was \\n\\ntwisting his insides again, and he knew that torture was \\n\\ncoming. \\n\\nNunc dimittis servum tuum, Domine. . . Quia viderunt oculi \\n\\nmei salutare. . . \\n\\nMaybe it will twist clean loose this time, he thought almost \\n\\nhopefully. He wanted to summon Father Gault to hear his \\n\\nconfession, but decided that it would be better to wait until \\n\\nthe guests had gone. He stared at the edict again. \\n\\nA knock at the door soon interrupted his agony. \\n\\n\"Can you come back later?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid I won\\'t be here later,\" answered a muffled \\n\\nvoice from the corridor. \\n\\n\"Oh, Thon Taddeo– come in, then.\" Dom Paulo \\n\\nstraightened; he took a firm grip on pain, not trying to \\n\\ndismiss it but only to control it as he would an unruly \\n\\nservant. \\n\\nThe scholar entered and placed a folder of papers on the \\n\\nabbot\\'s desk. \"I thought it only proper to leave you these,\" \\n\\nhe said. \\n\\n\"What do we have here?\" \\n\\n\"The sketches of your fortifications. The ones the officers \\n\\nmade. I suggest you burn them immediately.\" \\n\\n\"Why have you done this?\" Dom Paulo breathed. \"After our \\n\\nwords downstairs– \" \\n\\n\"Don\\'t misunderstand,\" Thon Taddeo interrupted. \"I would \\n\\nhave returned them in any event– as a matter of honor, \\n\\nnot to let them take advantage of your hospitality for– but \\n\\nnever mind. If I had returned the sketches any sooner, the \\n\\nofficers would have had plenty of time and opportunity to \\n\\ndraw up another set.\" \\n\\nThon Taddeo hesitated. \"I promise no effort on your \\n\\nbehalf– \" \\n\\n\"I know.\" \\n\\n\"– because I think what you have here should be open to \\n\\nthe world.\" \\n\\n\"It is, it was, it always will be.\" \\n\\nThey shook hands gingerly, but Dom Paulo knew that it \\n\\nwas no token of any truce but only of mutual respect \\n\\nbetween foes. Perhaps it would never be more. \\n\\nBut why must it all be acted again? \\n\\nThe answer was near at hand; there was still the serpent \\n\\nwhispering: For God doth know that in what day soever \\n\\nshall be as Gods. The old father of lies was clever at telling \\n\\nshall have sampled a little? Taste and be as Gods. But \\n\\nneither infinite power nor infinite wisdom could bestow \\n\\ngodhood upon men. For that there would have to be \\n\\ninfinite love as well. \\n\\nDom Paulo summoned the younger priest. It was very \\n\\nnearly time to go. And soon it would be a new year. \\n\\nThat was the year of the unprecedented torrent of rain on \\n\\nthe desert, causing seed long dry to burst into bloom. \\n\\nThat was the year that a vestige of civilization came to the \\n\\nnomads of the Plains, and even the people of Laredo began \\n\\nto murmur that it was possibly all for the best. Rome did \\n\\nnot agree. \\n\\nIn that year a temporary agreement was formalized and \\n\\nbroken between the states of Denver and Texarkana. It \\n\\nwas the year that the Old Jew returned to his former  \\n\\nvocation of Physician and Wanderer, the year that the \\n\\nmonks of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz buried an abbot \\n\\nand bowed to a new one. There were bright hopes for \\n\\ntomorrow. \\n\\nIt was the year a king came riding out of the east, to \\n\\nsubdue the land and own it. It was a year of Man. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Twenty-three  \\n\\nIt was unpleasantly hot beside the sunny trail that skirted \\n\\nthe wooded hillside, and the heat had aggravated the \\n\\nPoet\\'s thirst. After a long time he dizzily lifted his head \\n\\nfrom the ground and tried to look around. The melee had \\n\\nended; things were fairly quiet now, except for the cavalry \\n\\nofficer. The buzzards were even gliding down to land. \\n\\nThere were several dead refugees, one dead horse, and \\n\\nthe dying cavalry officer who was pinned under the horse. \\n\\nAt intervals, the cavalryman awoke and faintly screamed. \\n\\nNow he screamed for Mother, and again he screamed for a \\n\\npriest. At times he awoke to scream for his horse. His \\n\\nscreaming disquieted the buzzards and further disgruntled \\n\\nthe Poet, who was feeling peevish anyhow. He was a very \\n\\ndispirited Poet. He had never expected the world to act in \\n\\na courteous, seemly, or even sensible manner, and the \\n\\nworld had seldom done so; often he had taken heart in the \\n\\nconsistency of its rudeness and stupidity. But never before \\n\\nhad the world shot the Poet in the abdomen with a \\n\\nmusket. This he found not heartening at all. \\n\\nEven worse, he had not now the stupidity of the world to \\n\\nblame but only his own. The Poet himself had blundered. \\n\\nHe had been minding his own business and bothering no  \\n\\none when he noticed the party of refugees galloping \\n\\ntoward the hill from the east with a cavalry troop in close \\n\\npursuit. To avoid the affray, he had hidden himself behind \\n\\nsome scrub that grew from the lip of the embankment \\n\\nflanking the trail, a vantage point from which he could \\n\\nnot the Poet\\'s fight. He cared nothing whatever for the \\n\\npolitical and religious tastes of either the refugees or the \\n\\ncavalry troop. If slaughter had been fated, fate could have \\n\\nfound no less disinterested a witness than the Poet. \\n\\nWhence, then, the blind impulse? \\n\\nThe impulse had sent him leaping from the embankment to \\n\\ntackle the cavalry officer in the saddle and stab the fellow \\n\\nthree times with his own belt-knife before the two of them \\n\\ntoppled to the ground. He could not understand why he \\n\\nhad done it. Nothing had been accomplished. The officer\\'s \\n\\nmen had shot him down before he ever climbed to his feet. \\n\\nThe slaughter of refugees had continued. They had all \\n\\nridden away then in pursuit of other fugitives, leaving the \\n\\ndead behind. \\n\\nHe could hear his abdomen growl. The futility, alas, of \\n\\ntrying to digest a rifle ball. He had done the useless deed, \\n\\nhe decided finally, because of the part with the dull saber.  \\n\\nIf the officer had merely hacked the woman out of the \\n\\nsaddle with one clean stroke, and ridden on, the Poet \\n\\nwould have overlooked the deed. But to keep hacking and \\n\\nthought of water. \\n\\n\"O God– O God– \" the officer kept complaining. \\n\\n\"Next time, sharpen your cutlery,\" the Poet wheezed. \\n\\nBut there would be no next time. \\n\\nThe Poet could not remember ever fearing death, but he \\n\\nhad often suspected Providence of plotting the worst for \\n\\nhim as to the manner of his dying when the time came to \\n\\ngo. He had expected to rot away. Slowly and not very \\n\\nfragrantly. Some poetic insight had warned him that he \\n\\nwould surely die a blubbering leprous lump, cravenly \\n\\npenitential but impenitent. Never had he anticipated \\n\\nanything so blunt and final as a bullet in the stomach, and \\n\\nwith not even an audience at hand to hear his dying quips. \\n\\nThe last thing they had heard him say when they shot him \\n\\nwas: \"Oof!\"– his testament for posterity. Ooof!– a \\n\\nmemorabile for you, Domuissime. \\n\\n\"Father? Father?\" the officer moaned.  \\n\\nAfter a while the Poet mustered his strength and lifted his \\n\\nhead again, blinked dirt out of his eye, and studied the \\n\\nofficer for a few seconds. He was certain the officer was \\n\\nthe same one he had tackled, even though the fellow by \\n\\nnow had turned a chalky shade of green. His bleating for a \\n\\npriest that way began to annoy the Poet. At least three \\n\\nclergymen lay dead among the refugees, and yet the \\n\\nofficer was not now being so particular about specifying his \\n\\ndenominational persuasions. Maybe I\\'ll do, the Poet \\n\\nthought. \\n\\nHe began dragging himself slowly toward the cavalryman. \\n\\nThe officer saw him coming and groped for a pistol. The \\n\\nPoet paused; he had not expected to be recognized. He \\n\\nprepared to roll for cover. The pistol was wavering in his \\n\\ndirection. He watched it waver for a moment, then decided \\n\\nto continue his advance. The officer pulled the trigger. The \\n\\nshot went wild by yards, worse luck. \\n\\nThe officer was trying to reload when the Poet took the \\n\\ngun away from him. He seemed delirious, and kept trying \\n\\nto cross himself. \\n\\n\"Go ahead,\" the Poet grunted, finding the knife. \\n\\n\"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned– \" \\n\\n\"Ego te absolvo, son,\" said the Poet, and plunged the knife \\n\\ninto his throat. \\n\\nAfterward, he found the officer\\'s canteen and drank a little. \\n\\nThe water was hot from the sun, but it seemed delicious. \\n\\nHe lay with his head pillowed on the officer\\'s horse and \\n\\nwaited for the shadow of the hill to creep over the road. \\n\\nJesus, how it hurt! That last bit isn\\'t going to be as easy to \\n\\nexplain, he thought; and me without my eyeball too. If \\n\\nthere\\'s really anything to explain. He looked at the dead \\n\\ncavalryman. \\n\\n\"Hot as hell down there, isn\\'t it?\" he whispered hoarsely. \\n\\nThe cavalryman was not being informative. The Poet took \\n\\nanother drink from the canteen, then another. Suddenly \\n\\nthere was a very painful bowel movement. He was quite \\n\\nunhappy about it for a moment or two. \\n\\nThe buzzards strutted, preened, and quarreled over  \\n\\ndinner; it was not yet properly cured. They waited a few \\n\\ndays for the wolves. There was plenty for all. Finally they \\n\\nate the Poet. \\n\\nAs always the wild black scavengers of the skies laid their \\n\\nthe fulfillment of that share of life\\'s destiny which was \\n\\ntheirs according to the plan of Nature. Their philosophers \\n\\ndemonstrated by unaided reason alone that the Supreme \\n\\nCathartes aura regnans had created the world especially \\n\\nfor buzzards. They worshipped him with hearty appetites \\n\\nfor many centuries. \\n\\nThen, after the generations of the darkness came the \\n\\ngenerations of the light. And they called it the Year of Our \\n\\nLord 3781– a year of His peace, they prayed. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nPart III Fiat Voluntas Tua \\n\\nChapter Twenty-four \\n\\nThere were spaceships again in that century, and the ships \\n\\nwere manned by fuzzy impossibilities that walked on two \\n\\nlegs and sprouted tufts of hair in unlikely anatomical \\n\\nregions. They were a garrulous kind. They belonged to a \\n\\nrace quite capable of admiring its own image in a mirror, \\n\\nand equally capable of cutting its own throat before the \\n\\naltar of some tribal god, such as the deity of Daily \\n\\nShaving. It was a species which often considered itself to \\n\\nbe, basically, a race of divinely inspired toolmakers; any \\n\\nintelligent entity from Arcturus would instantly have \\n\\nperceived them to be, basically, a race of impassioned \\n\\nafter-dinner speech-makers. \\n\\nIt was inevitable, it was manifest destiny, they felt (and \\n\\nnot for the first time) that such a race go forth to conquer \\n\\nstars. To conquer them several times, if need be, and \\n\\ncertainly to make speeches about the conquest. But, too, it \\n\\nwas inevitable that the race succumb again to the old \\n\\nmaladies on new worlds, even as on Earth before, in the \\n\\nlitany of life and in the special liturgy of Man: Versicles by \\n\\nAdam, Rejoinders by the Crucified. \\n\\nWe are the centuries. \\n\\nWe are the chin-choppers and the golly-woppers, and soon \\n\\nwe shall discuss the amputation of your head. \\n\\nWe are your singing garbage men, Sir and Madam, and we \\n\\nmarch in cadence behind you, chanting rhymes that some  \\n\\nthink odd.  \\n\\nHut two threep foa!  \\n\\nLeft!  \\n\\nLeft!  \\n\\nHe-had-a-good-wife-but-he  \\n\\nLeft!  \\n\\nLeft!  \\n\\nLeft!  \\n\\nRight!  \\n\\nLeft!  \\n\\nWir, as they say in the old country, marschieren weiter  \\n\\nwenn dies in Scherben fallt. \\n\\nWe have your eoliths and your mesoliths and your \\n\\nneoliths. We have your Babylons and your Pompeiis, your \\n\\nCaesars and your chromium-plated \\n\\n(vital-ingredient-impregnated) artifacts. \\n\\nWe have your bloody hatchets and your Hiroshimas. We \\n\\nmarch in spite of Hell, we do–  \\n\\nAtrophy, Entropy, and Proteus vulgaris,  \\n\\ntelling bawdy jokes about a farm girl name of Eve  \\n\\nand a traveling salesman called Lucifer.  \\n\\nWe bury your dead and their reputations.  \\n\\nWe bury you. We are the centuries.  \\n\\nseek manhood, taste a little of godhood, feel pain, give \\n\\nbirth, struggle a little while, succumb: \\n\\n(Dying, leave quietly by the rear exit, please.) \\n\\nGeneration, regeneration, again, again, as in a ritual, with \\n\\nblood-stained vestments and nail-torn hands, children of \\n\\nMerlin, chasing a gleam. Children, too, of Eve, forever \\n\\nbecause somehow it isn\\'t the same. (AGH! AGH! AGH!– an \\n\\nidiot screams his mindless anguish amid the rubble. But \\n\\nquickly! let it be inundated by the choir, chanting Alleluias \\n\\nat ninety decibels.) \\n\\nHear then, the last Canticle of the Brethren of the Order of \\n\\nLeibowitz, as sung by the century that swallowed its name: \\n\\nV: Lucifer is fallen. \\n\\nR: Kyrie eleison.  \\n\\nV: Lucifer is fallen.  \\n\\nR: Christe eleison. \\n\\nV: Lucifer is fallen. \\n\\nR: Kyrie eleison, eleison imas! \\n\\nLUCIFER IS FALLEN; the code words, flashed electrically \\n\\nacross the continent, were whispered in conference rooms, \\n\\nwere circulated in the form of crisp memoranda stamped \\n\\nSUPREME SECRETISSIMO, were prudently withheld from \\n\\nthe press. The words rose in a threatening tide behind a \\n\\ndike of official secrecy. There were several holes in the \\n\\ndike, but the holes were fearlessly plugged by bureaucratic \\n\\nDutch boys whose forefingers became exceedingly swollen \\n\\nwhile they dodged verbal spitballs fired by the press. \\n\\nFIRST REPORTER: What is Your Lordship\\'s comment on Sir \\n\\nRische Thon Berker\\'s statement that the radiation count on \\n\\nthe Northwest Coast is ten times the normal level? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: I have not read the statement.  \\n\\nFIRST REPORTER: Assuming it to be true, what could be \\n\\nresponsible for such an increase? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: The question calls for conjecture. \\n\\nPerhaps Sir Rische discovered a rich uranium deposit. No, \\n\\nstrike that out. I have no comment. \\n\\nSECOND REPORTER: Does Your Lordship regard Sir Rische \\n\\nas a competent and responsible scientist? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: He has never been employed by my \\n\\ndepartment. \\n\\nSECOND REPORTER: That is not a responsive answer. \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: It is quite responsive. Since he has \\n\\nnever been employed by my department, I have no way of \\n\\nknowing his competence or responsibility. I am not a \\n\\nscientist. \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: Is it true that a nuclear explosion \\n\\noccurred recently somewhere across the Pacific? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: As Madam well knows, the testing of  \\n\\natomic weapons of any kind is a high crime and an act of \\n\\nwar under present international law. We are not at war. \\n\\nDoes that answer your question? \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: No, Your Lordship, it does not. I did not \\n\\nask if a test had occurred. I asked whether an explosion \\n\\nhad occurred. \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: We set off no such explosion. If they \\n\\nset one off, does Madam suppose that this government \\n\\nwould be informed of it by them? \\n\\n(Polite laughter.) \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: That does not answer my– \\n\\nFIRST REPORTER: Your Lordship, Delegate Jerulian has \\n\\ncharged the Asian Coalition with the assembly of hydrogen \\n\\nweapons in deep space, and he says our Executive Council \\n\\nknows it and does nothing about it. Is that true? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: I believe it is true that the \\n\\nOpposition\\'s Tribune made some such ridiculous charge, \\n\\nyes. \\n\\nFIRST REPORTER: Why is the charge ridiculous? Because  \\n\\nthey are not making space-to-earth missiles in space? Or \\n\\nbecause we are doing something about it? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: Ridiculous either way. I should like to \\n\\npoint out, however, that the manufacture of nuclear \\n\\nweapons has been prohibited by treaty ever since they \\n\\nwere redeveloped. Prohibited everywhere– in space or on \\n\\nEarth. \\n\\nSECOND REPORTER: But there\\'s no treaty to proscribe the \\n\\norbiting of fissionable materials, is there? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: Of course not. The space-to-space \\n\\nvehicles are all nuclear powered. They have to be fueled. \\n\\nSECOND REPORTER: And there\\'s no treaty to prohibit \\n\\norbiting of other materials from which nuclear weapons \\n\\nmight be manufactured? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER (irritably): To my knowledge, the \\n\\nexistence of matter outside our atmosphere has not been \\n\\noutlawed by any treaty or act of parliament. It is my \\n\\nunderstanding that space is chock-full of things like the \\n\\nmoon and the asteroids, which are not made of green \\n\\ncheese.  \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: Is Your Lordship suggesting that nuclear \\n\\nweapons could be manufactured without raw materials \\n\\nfrom Earth? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: I was not suggesting that, no. Of \\n\\ncourse it\\'s theoretically possible. I was saying that no \\n\\ntreaty or law prohibits the orbiting of any special raw \\n\\nmaterials– only nuclear weapons.\\n\\n LADY REPORTER: If there was a recent test shot in the \\n\\nOrient, which do you think more probable: a subterranean \\n\\nexplosion that broke surface, or a space-to-earth missile \\n\\nwith a defective warhead? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: Madam, your question is so \\n\\nconjectural that you force me to say: \"No comment.\" \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: I was only echoing Sir Rische and \\n\\nDelegate Jerulian. \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: They are free to indulge in wild \\n\\nspeculation. I am not. \\n\\nSECOND REPORTER: At the risk of seeming wry– What is \\n\\nYour Lordship\\'s opinion of the weather? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: Rather warm in Texarkana, isn\\'t it? I \\n\\nunderstand they\\'re having some bad dust storms in the \\n\\nSouthwest. We may catch some of it hereabouts. \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: Are you in favor of Motherhood, Lord \\n\\nRagelle? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: I am sternly opposed to it, Madam. It \\n\\nexerts a malign influence on youth, particularly upon \\n\\nyoung recruits. The military services would have superior \\n\\nsoldiers if our fighting men had not been corrupted by \\n\\nMotherhood. \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: May we quote you on that? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: Certainly, Madam– but only in my \\n\\nobituary, not sooner. \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: Thank you. I\\'ll prepare it in advance. \\n\\nLike other abbots before him, the Dom Jethrah Zerchi was \\n\\nas spiritual ruler of his community he was vowed to foster \\n\\nthe development of certain aspects of the contemplative \\n\\nlife in this flock, and, as a monk, to attempt the cultivation \\n\\nof a contemplative disposition in himself. Dom Zerchi was \\n\\nnot very good at either of these. His nature impelled him \\n\\ntoward action even in thought; his mind refused to sit still \\n\\nand contemplate. There was a quality of restlessness about \\n\\nhim which had driven him to the leadership of the flock; it \\n\\nmade him a bolder ruler, occasionally even a more \\n\\nsame restlessness could easily become a liability, or even a \\n\\nvice. \\n\\nZerchi was vaguely aware, most of the time, of his own \\n\\ninclination toward hasty or impulsive action when \\n\\nconfronted by unslayable dragons. Just now, however, the \\n\\nawareness was not vague but acute. It operated in \\n\\nunfortunate retrospect. The dragon had already bitten St. \\n\\nGeorge. \\n\\nThe dragon was an Abominable Autoscribe, and its \\n\\nmalignant enormity, electronic by disposition, filled several \\n\\ncubical units of hollow wall space and a third of the volume \\n\\nof the abbot\\'s desk. As usual, the contraption was on the \\n\\nblink. It miscapitalized, mispunctuated, and interchanged \\n\\nvarious words. Only a moment ago, it had committed \\n\\nelectrical lese majeste on the person of the sovereign \\n\\nthree days for him to appear, had decided to repair the \\n\\nstenographic abomination himself. The floor of his study \\n\\nwas littered with typed scraps of trial dictation. Typical \\n\\namong these was one which bore the information:\\n\\n tEsting tesTing testiNg? TESting tesTing? damNatioN? \\n\\nwhY the \\n\\ncraZY capITALs# now Is the tiMe foR alL gooD \\n\\nmemoriZERS to Gum \\n\\nto tHe aCHe of the bookLEGgerS?

What\\'s wronG WITH tHe  \\n\\nblasTED THing#  \\n\\nZerchi sat on the floor in the midst of the litter and tried to \\n\\nmassage the involuntary tremor out of his forearm, which \\n\\nhad been recently electrified while exploring the \\n\\nAutoscribe\\'s intestinal regions. The muscular twitching \\n\\nreminded him of the galvanic response of a severed frog\\'s \\n\\nleg. Since he had prudently remembered to disconnect the \\n\\nmachine before tampering with it, he could only suppose \\n\\nthat the fiend who invented the thing had provided it with \\n\\nfacilities for electrocuting customers even without power. \\n\\nWhile tweaking and tugging at connections in a search for \\n\\nloose wires, he had been assaulted by a high voltage filter \\n\\ncapacitor which had taken advantage of an opportunity to \\n\\ndischarge itself to ground through the person of the \\n\\nReverend Father Abbot when Reverend Father\\'s elbow \\n\\nbrushed against the chassis. But Zerchi had no way of \\n\\nknowing whether he had fallen victim to a law of Nature \\n\\nfor filter capacitors or to a cunningly devised booby trap \\n\\naimed at discouraging customer-tampering. Anyway, he \\n\\nhad fallen. His posture on the floor had come about \\n\\ninvoluntarily. His only claim to competence at the repair of \\n\\npolylinguistic transcription devices lay in his proud record \\n\\nof once having extracted a dead mouse from the  \\n\\ninformation storage circuitry, thereby correcting a \\n\\nmysterious tendency on the part of the machine to write \\n\\ndouble syllables (doudoubleble sylsylabablesles). Having \\n\\ndiscovered no dead mice this time, he could feel for loose \\n\\nwires and hope Heaven had granted him charismata as an \\n\\nelectronic healer. But it was apparently not so. \\n\\n\"Brother Patrick!\" he called toward the outer office, and \\n\\nclimbed wearily to his feet. \\n\\n\"Hey, Brother Pat!\" he shouted again. \\n\\nPresently the door opened and his secretary waddled in, \\n\\nglanced at the open wall cabinets with their stupefying \\n\\nthen warily studied his spiritual ruler\\'s expression. \"Shall I \\n\\ncall the repair service again, Father Abbot?\" \\n\\n\"Why bother?\" Zerchi grunted. \"You\\'ve called them three \\n\\ntimes. They\\'ve made three promises. We\\'ve waited three \\n\\ndays. I need a stenographer. Now! Preferably a Christian. \\n\\nThat thing– \" he waved irritably toward the Abominable \\n\\nAutoscribe– \"is a damned infidel or worse. Get rid of it. I \\n\\nwant it out of here.\"  \\n\\n\"The APLAC?\"  \\n\\n\"The APLAC. Sell it to an atheist. No, that wouldn\\'t be kind. \\n\\nSell it as junk. I\\'m through with it. Why, for Heaven\\'s sake, \\n\\ndid Abbot Boumous– may his soul be blessed– ever buy \\n\\nthe silly contraption?\" \\n\\n\"Well, Domne, they say your predecessor was fond of \\n\\ngadgets, and it is convenient to be able to write letters in \\n\\nlanguages you yourself can\\'t speak.\" \\n\\n\"It is? You mean it would be. That contraption– listen, \\n\\nBrother, they claim it thinks. I didn\\'t believe it at first. \\n\\nThought, implying rational principle, implying soul. Can the \\n\\nprinciple of a \\'thinking machine\\'– man-made– be a rational \\n\\nsoul? Bah! It seemed a thoroughly pagan notion at first. \\n\\nBut do you know what?\" \\n\\n\"Father?\" \\n\\n\"Nothing could be that perverse without premeditation! It \\n\\nmust think! It knows good and evil, I tell you, and it chose \\n\\nthe latter. Stop that snickering, will you? It\\'s not funny. \\n\\nThe notion isn\\'t even pagan. Man made the contraption, \\n\\nbut he didn\\'t make its principle. They speak of the \\n\\nvegetative principle as a soul, don\\'t they? A vegetable \\n\\nsoul? And the animal soul? Then the rational human soul, \\n\\nand that\\'s all they list in the way of incarnate vivifying \\n\\nprinciples, angels being disembodied. But how do we know \\n\\nthe list is comprehensive? Vegetative, animative, rational– \\n\\nand then what else? That\\'s what else, right there. That \\n\\nthing. And it fell. Get it out of here– But first I\\'ve got to \\n\\nget a radiogram off to Rome.\" \\n\\n\"Shall I get my pad, Reverend Father?\" \\n\\n\"Do you speak Alleghenian?\" \\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t.\" \\n\\n\"Neither do I, and Cardinal Hoffstraff doesn\\'t speak \\n\\nSouthwest.\" \\n\\n\"Why not Latin, then?\" \\n\\n\"Which Latin? The Vulgate or Modern? I don\\'t trust my own \\n\\nAnglo-Latin, and if I did, he\\'d probably not trust his.\" He \\n\\nfrowned at the bulk of the robotic stenographer. \\n\\nBrother Patrick frowned with him, then stepped over to the \\n\\ncabinets and began peering into the maze of subminiature \\n\\ncircuit components. \\n\\n\"No mouse,\" the abbot assured him. \\n\\n\"What are all these little knobs?\" \\n\\n\"Don\\'t touch!\" Abbot Zerchi yelped as his secretary \\n\\ncuriously fingered one of several dozen sub-chassis dial \\n\\nsettings. These subchassis controls were mounted in neat \\n\\nsquare array in a box, the cover of which the abbot had \\n\\nremoved, bore the irresistible warning: FACTORY \\n\\nADJUSTMENTS ONLY. \\n\\n\"You didn\\'t move it, did you?\" he demanded, going to \\n\\nPatrick\\'s side. \\n\\n\"I might have wiggled it a little, but I think it\\'s back where \\n\\nit was.\" \\n\\nZerchi showed him the warning on the box\\'s cover. \"Oh,\" \\n\\nsaid Pat, and both of them stared. \\n\\n\"It\\'s the punctuation, mostly, isn\\'t it, Reverend Father?\" \\n\\n\"That and stray capitals, and a few confused words.\"  \\n\\nThey contemplated the squiggles, quiggles, quids, \\n\\nthingumbobs, and doohickii in mystified silence. \\n\\n\"Did you ever hear of the Venerable Francis of Utah?\" the \\n\\nabbot asked at last. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t recall the name, Domne. Why?\" \\n\\n\"I was just hoping he\\'s in a position to pray for us right \\n\\nnow, although I don\\'t believe he was ever canonized. Here, \\n\\nlet\\'s try turning this whatsis up a bit.\" \\n\\n\"Brother Joshua used to be some kind of an engineer. I \\n\\nforget what. But he was in space. They have to know a lot \\n\\nabout computers.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ve already called him. He\\'s afraid to touch it. Here, \\n\\nmaybe it needs– \" \\n\\nPatrick edged away. \"If you would excuse me, m\\'Lord, I– \" \\n\\nZerchi glanced up at his wincing scribe. \"Oh, ye of little \\n\\nfaith!\" he said, correcting another FACTORY ADJUSTMENT. \\n\\n\"I thought I heard someone outside.\" \\n\\n\"Before the cock crows thrice– besides, you touched the \\n\\nfirst knob, didn\\'t you?\" \\n\\nPatrick wilted. \"But the cover was off, and. . .\" \\n\\n\"Hinc igitur effuge. Out, out, before I decide it was your \\n\\nfault.\" \\n\\nAlone again, Zerchi inserted the wall plug, sat at his desk, \\n\\nin recent centuries had come into wider popularity as the \\n\\nfounder of the Albertian Order of Saint Leibowitz), flipped \\n\\nthe switch. He listened for spitting and hissing noises, but \\n\\nnone came. He heard only the faint clicking of delay relays \\n\\nfull speed. He sniffed. No smoke or ozone to be detected. \\n\\nFinally, he opened his eyes. Even the indicator lights of the \\n\\ndesktop control panel were burning as usual. FACTORY \\n\\nADJUSTMENTS ONLY, indeed! \\n\\nSomewhat reassured, he switched the format selector to \\n\\nRADIOGRAM, turned the process selector to \\n\\nDICTATE-RECORD, the translator unit to SOUTHWEST IN \\n\\nand ALLEGHENIAN OUT, made certain the transcription \\n\\nswitch was on OFF, keyed his microphone button and \\n\\nbegan dictating: \\n\\n\"Priority Urgent: To His Most Reverend Eminence, Sir Eric \\n\\nCardinal Hoffstraff, Vicar Apostolic Designate, Provisional \\n\\nVicariate Extraterrestris, Sacred Congregation of \\n\\nPropaganda, Vatican, New Rome. . . \\n\\n\"Most Eminent Lord: In view of the recent renewal of world \\n\\ntensions, hints of a new international crisis, and even \\n\\nreports of a clandestine nuclear armaments race, we \\n\\nshould be greatly honored if Your Eminence deems it \\n\\nprudent to counsel us concerning the present status of \\n\\ncertain plans held in abeyance. I have reference to matters \\n\\noutlined in the Motu proprio of Pope Celestine the Eighth, \\n\\nof happy memory, given on the Feast of the Divine \\n\\nOvershadowing of the Holy Virgin, Anno Domini 3735, and \\n\\nbeginning with the words– \" he paused to look through the \\n\\npapers on his desk– \" \\'Ab hac planeta nativitatis aliquos \\n\\nfihios Ecclesiae usque ad planetas solium alienorum iam \\n\\nabisse at numquam redituros esse intelligimus.\\' Refer also \\n\\nto the confirming document of Anno Domini 3749, Quo \\n\\nperegrinatur grex, pastor secum, authorizing the purchase \\n\\nof an island, uh– certain vehicles. Lastly refer to Casu belli \\n\\nand the correspondence which followed between the Holy \\n\\nFather and my predecessor, culminating with an order \\n\\ntransferring to us the task of holding the plan Quo \\n\\nperegrinatur in a state of, uh– suspended animation, but \\n\\nonly so long as Your Eminence approves. Our state of \\n\\nreadiness with respect to Quo peregrinatur has been \\n\\nmaintained, and should it become desirable to execute the \\n\\nplan, we would need perhaps six weeks\\' notice. . . \\n\\nWhile the abbot dictated, the Abominable Autoscribe did no \\n\\nmore than record his voice and translate it into a phoneme \\n\\nthe process selector to ANALYZE and pressed a button \\n\\nmarked TEXT PROCESSING. The ready-lamp winked off. \\n\\nThe machine began processing. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Zerchi studied the documents before him.  \\n\\nA chime sounded. The ready-lamp winked on. The machine \\n\\nwas silent. With only one nervous glance at the FACTORY \\n\\nADJUSTMENTS ONLY box, the abbot closed his eyes and \\n\\npressed the WRITE button. \\n\\nClatterty-chat-clatter-spatter-pip popperty-kak-fub-clotter, \\n\\nthe automatic writer chattered away at what he hoped \\n\\nwould be the text of the radiogram. He listened hopefully \\n\\nto the rhythm of the keys. That first \\n\\nclatterty-chat-clatter-spatter-pip had sounded quite \\n\\nauthoritative. He tried to hear the rhythms of Alleghenian \\n\\nspeech in the sound of the typing, and after a time he \\n\\ndecided that there was indeed a certain Allegheny lilt \\n\\nmixed into the rattle of the keys. He opened his eyes. \\n\\nwork. He left his desk and went to watch it work. With \\n\\nutmost neatness, the Abominable Autoscribe was writing \\n\\nthe Alleghenian equivalent of:\\n\\n TNEGRU YTIROIRP– MARGOIDAR \\n\\ncirE riS\\n\\n ,etangiseD cilotsopA raciV,sirtserretartxE etairaciV \\n\\nlanoisivorP,nacitaV ,adnagaporP fo noitagergnoC dercaS\\n\\n emoR weN \\n\\nsabbA ,LOA ,ihcreZ harhteJ .veR \\n:MORF \\n\\nztiwobieL tniaS fo yebbA yrotirreT W uoS ,sttiwoB ylnaS\\n\\n xerG rutanirgereP ouQ :TCEJBUS\\n\\n :droL tnenimE tsoM ,snoisnet dlrow fo lawener tnecer eht \\n\\nfo weiv nI \\nneve dna ,sisirc lanoitanretni wen a fo stnih \\n\\n,ecar stnemamra raelcun enitsednalc a fo stroper\\n\\n . . . dluohs ew \\n\\n\"Hey, Brother Pat!\"  \\n\\nHe turned off the machine in disgust.

Don\\'t you like our \\n\\nmodern technology?\" \\n\\n\"Not particularly, no!\" Zerchi snapped. \"Hey, Pat!\" \\n\\n\"He\\'s out, m\\'Lord.\" \\n\\n\"Brother Joshua, can\\'t you fix this thing?

That\\'s  \\n\\nall I know, except what I hear from the radiation  \\n\\ncounters.\"  \\n\\n\"Still rising?\" \\n\\n\"Still rising.\" \\n\\n\"Call Spokane.\" \\n\\nBy midafternoon the dusty wind had come. The wind came \\n\\nover the mesa and over the small city of Sanly Bowitts. It \\n\\nwashed over the surrounding countryside, noisily through \\n\\nthe tall corn in the irrigated fields, tearing streamers of \\n\\nblowing sand from the sterile ridges. It moaned about the \\n\\nstone walls of the ancient abbey and about the aluminum \\n\\nand glass walls of the modern additions to the abbey. It \\n\\nbesmirched the reddening sun with the dirt of the land, \\n\\nmodern additions. \\n\\nOn the side road which at one point flanked the highway \\n\\nand led from the monastery by way of a residential suburb \\n\\ninto the city, an old beggar clad in burlap paused to listen \\n\\nto the wind. The wind brought the throb of practice \\n\\nrocketry explosively from the south. Ground-to-space \\n\\ninterceptor missiles were being fired toward target orbits \\n\\nfrom a launching range far across the desert. The old man \\n\\ngazed at the faint red disk of the sun while he leaned on \\n\\nhis staff and muttered to himself or to the sun, \"Omens, \\n\\nomens– \" \\n\\nA group of children were playing in the weed-filled yard of \\n\\na hovel just across the side road, their games proceeding \\n\\nunder the mute but all-seeing auspices of a gnarled black \\n\\nwoman who smoked a weed-filled pipe on the porch and \\n\\noffered an occasional word of solace or remonstrance to  \\n\\none or another tearful player who came as plaintiff before \\n\\nthe grandmotherly court of her hovel porch. \\n\\nOne of the children soon noticed the old tramp who stood \\n\\nacross the roadway, and presently a shout went up: \\n\\n\"Lookit, lookit! It\\'s old Lazar! Auntie say, he be old Lazar, \\n\\nsame one \\'ut the Lor\\' Hesus raise up! Lookit! Lazar! Lazar!\" \\n\\nThe children thronged to the broken fence. The old tramp \\n\\nregarded them grumpily for a moment, then wandered on \\n\\nalong the road. A pebble skipped across the ground at his \\n\\nfeet. \\n\\n\"Hey, Lazar . . . !\" \\n\\n\"Auntie say, what the Lor\\' Hesus raise up, it stay up! \\n\\nLookit him! Ya! Still huntin\\' for the Lor\\' \\'ut raise him. \\n\\nAuntie say– .\" \\n\\nAnother rock skipped after the old man, but he did not look \\n\\nback. The old woman nodded sleepily. The children \\n\\nreturned to their games. The dust storm thickened. \\n\\nAcross the highway from the ancient abbey, atop one of  \\n\\nthe new aluminum and glass buildings, a monk on the roof  \\n\\nwas sampling the wind. He sampled it with a suction \\n\\ndevice which ate the dusty air and blew the filtered wind to \\n\\nthe intake of an air compressor on the floor below. The \\n\\nmonk was no longer a youth, but not yet middle-aged. His \\n\\nshort red beard seemed electrically charged, for it \\n\\ngathered pendant webs and streamers of dust; he \\n\\nscratched it irritably from time to time, and once he thrust \\n\\nhis chin into the end of the suction hose; the result caused \\n\\nhim to mutter explosively, then to cross himself. \\n\\nThe compressor\\'s motor coughed and died. The monk \\n\\nswitched off the suction device, disconnected the blower \\n\\nhose and pulled the device across the roof to the elevator \\n\\nand into the cage. Drifts of dust had settled in the corners. \\n\\nHe closed the gate and pressed the Down button. \\n\\ncompressor\\'s gauge– it registered MAX NORM– he closed \\n\\nthe door, removed his habit, shook the dust out of it, hung \\n\\nit on a peg, and went over it with the suction device. Then, \\n\\ngoing to the deep sheet-steel sink at the end of the \\n\\nlaboratory workbench, he turned on the cold water and let \\n\\nit rise to the 200 JUG mark. Thrusting his head into the \\n\\nwater, he washed the mud from his beard and hair. The \\n\\nglanced at the door. The likelihood of visitors just now \\n\\nseemed small. He removed his underwear, climbed into \\n\\nthe tank, and settled back with a shivery sigh. \\n\\nAbruptly the door opened. Sister Helene came in with a \\n\\ntray of newly uncrated glassware. Startled, the monk \\n\\nleaped to his feet in the tub. \\n\\n\"Brother Joshua!\" the sister shrieked. Half a dozen beakers \\n\\nshattered on the floor. \\n\\nThe monk sat down with a splash that sprayed the room. \\n\\nSister Helene clucked, sputtered, squeaked, dumped the \\n\\ntray on the workbench, and fled. Joshua vaulted out of the \\n\\nsink and donned his habit without bothering to dry himself \\n\\nor put on his underwear. When he got to the door, Sister \\n\\nbuilding and halfway to the sister\\'s chapel just down the \\n\\nside lane. Mortified, he hastened to complete his labors. \\n\\nHe emptied the suction device\\'s contents and collected a \\n\\nsample of the dust in a phial. He took the phial to the \\n\\nworkbench, plugged in a pair of headphones, and held the \\n\\nphial at a measured distance from the detector element of \\n\\na radiation counter while he consulted his watch and  \\n\\nlistened. \\n\\nThe compressor had a built-in counter. He pressed a stud \\n\\nmarked: RESET. The whirling decimal register flipped back \\n\\nminute and wrote the count on the back of his hand. It \\n\\nwas mostly plain air, filtered and compressed; but there \\n\\nwas a whiff of something else. \\n\\nHe closed the lab for the afternoon. He went down to the \\n\\noffice on the subjacent floor, wrote the count on a wall \\n\\nchart, eyed its perplexing upswing, then sat at his desk \\n\\nand flipped the viewphone switch. He dialed by feel, while \\n\\ngazing at the telltale wall chart. The screen flashed, the \\n\\nback of an empty desk chair. After a few seconds a man \\n\\nslid into the chair and peered into the viewer. \"Abbot \\n\\nwas about to call you. Have you been taking a bath?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord Abbot.\" \\n\\n\"You might at least blush!\" \\n\\n\"I am.\"  \\n\\n\"Well, it doesn\\'t show up on the viewer. Listen. On this \\n\\nside of the highway, there\\'s a sign just outside our gates. \\n\\nYou\\'ve noticed it, of course? It says, \\'Women Beware. \\n\\nEnter Not Lest\\'– and so forth. You\\'ve noticed it?\" \\n\\n\"Surely, m\\'Lord.\"  \\n\\n\"Take your baths on this side of the sign.\"  \\n\\n\"Certainly.\"  \\n\\n\"Mortify yourself for offending Sister\\'s modesty. I\\'m aware  \\n\\nthat you haven\\'t got any. Listen, I suppose you can\\'t even \\n\\nbring yourself to pass the reservoir without jumping in, \\n\\nbaby-spanking bald, for a swim.\" \\n\\n\"Who told you that, m\\'Lord? I mean– I\\'ve only waded– \" \\n\\n\"Ye-e-s-s? Well, never mind. Why did you call me?\" \\n\\n\"You wanted me to call Spokane.\" \\n\\n\"Oh, yes. Did you?\"  \\n\\nof his wind-cracked lips and paused uneasily. \"I talked to \\n\\nFather Leone. They\\'ve noticed it too.\" \\n\\n\"The increased radiation count?\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s not all.\" He hesitated again. He did not like saying \\n\\nit. To communicate a fact seemed always to lend it fuller \\n\\nexistence. \\n\\n\"Well?\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s connected with that seismic disturbance a few days \\n\\nago. It\\'s carried by the upper winds from that direction. All \\n\\nthings considered, it looks like fallout from a low altitude \\n\\nburst in the megaton range.\" \\n\\n\"Heu!\" Zerchi sighed and covered his eyes with a hand. \\n\\n\"Luciferum ruisse mihi dicis?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, Domne, I\\'m afraid it was a weapon.\" \\n\\n\"Not possibly an industrial accident?\" \\n\\n\"No.\"  \\n\\n\"But if there were a war on, we\\'d know. An illicit test? but \\n\\nnot that either. If they wanted to test one, they could test \\n\\nit on the far side of the moon, or better, Mars, and not be \\n\\ncaught.\" \\n\\nJoshua nodded. \\n\\n\"So what does that leave?\" the abbot went on. \"A display? \\n\\nA threat? A warning shot fired over the bow?\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s all I could think of.\" \\n\\n\"So that explains the defense alert. Still, there\\'s nothing in \\n\\nthe news except rumors and refusals to comment. And \\n\\nwith dead silence from Asia.\" \\n\\n\"But the shot must have been reported from some of the \\n\\nobservation satellites. Unless– I don\\'t like to suggest this, \\n\\nbut– unless somebody has discovered a way to shoot a \\n\\nspace-to-earth missile past the satellites, without detection \\n\\nuntil it\\'s on the target.\" \\n\\n\"Is that possible?\" \\n\\n\"There\\'s been some talk about it, Father Abbot.\" \\n\\n\"The government knows. The government must know. \\n\\nSeveral of them know. And yet we hear nothing. We are \\n\\nbeing protected from hysteria. Isn\\'t that what they call it? \\n\\nManiacs! The world\\'s been in a habitual state of crisis for \\n\\nfifty years. Fifty? What am I saying? It\\'s been in a habitual \\n\\nstate of crisis since the beginning– but for half a century \\n\\nnow, almost unbearable. And why, for the love of God? \\n\\nWhat is the fundamental irritant, the essence of the \\n\\ntension? Political philosophies? Economics? Population \\n\\npressure? Disparity of culture and creed? Ask a dozen \\n\\nexperts, get a dozen answers. Now Lucifer again. Is the \\n\\nspecies congenitally insane, Brother? If we\\'re born mad, \\n\\nwhere\\'s the hope of Heaven? Through Faith alone? Or isn\\'t \\n\\nthere any? God forgive me, I don\\'t mean that. Listen, \\n\\nJoshua– \" \\n\\n\"M\\'Lord?\" \\n\\n\"As soon as you close up shop, come back over here. . . . \\n\\nThat radiogram– I had to send Brother Pat into town to get \\n\\nit translated and sent by regular wire. I want you around \\n\\nwhen the answer comes. Do you know what it\\'s about?\" \\n\\nBrother Joshua shook his head. \\n\\n\"Quo peregrinatur grex.\"  \\n\\n\"I\\'m just trying to learn the status of the plan. Don\\'t \\n\\nmention it to anybody. Of course, you\\'ll be affected. See \\n\\nme here when you\\'re through.\" \\n\\n\"Certainly.\" \\n\\n\"Chris\\'tecum.\" \\n\\n\"Cum spiri\\'tuo.\" \\n\\nThe circuit opened, the screen faded. The room was warm, \\n\\nbut Joshua shivered. He gazed out the window into a \\n\\npremature twilight murky with dust. He could see no \\n\\nfarther than the storm fence next to the highway where a \\n\\npassing procession of truck headlights made traveling \\n\\nhaloes in the dust haze. After a while he became aware of \\n\\nsomeone standing near the gate where the driveway \\n\\nopened on to the turnpike approach. The figure was dimly \\n\\nvisible in silhouette whenever the headlights\\' aurorae \\n\\nflashed by in review. Joshua shivered again. \\n\\nThe silhouette was unmistakably that of Mrs. Grales. No \\n\\none else would have been recognizable in such poor \\n\\nvisibility, but the shape of the hooded bundle on her left \\n\\nshoulder, and the way her head tilted toward the right, \\n\\nmade her outline uniquely that of Old Ma\\'am Grales. The \\n\\nmonk pulled curtains across the window and turned on the \\n\\nlight. He was not repelled by the old woman\\'s deformity; \\n\\nthe world had grown blase about such genetic mishaps and \\n\\npranks of the genes. His own left hand still bore a tiny scar \\n\\nwhere a sixth finger had been removed during his infancy. \\n\\nBut the heritage of the Diluvium Ignis was something he \\n\\npreferred to forget for the moment, and Mrs. Grales was \\n\\none of its more conspicuous heirs. \\n\\nHe fingered a globe of the world on his desk. He spun it so \\n\\nthat the Pacific Ocean and East Asia drifted past. Where? \\n\\nPrecisely where? He twirled the globe faster, slapping it \\n\\nlightly again and again so that the world spun like a \\n\\ngaming wheel, faster and yet faster until the continents \\n\\nand oceans became a blur. Place your bets, Sir and \\n\\nMadam: Where? He braked the globe abruptly with his \\n\\nthumb. Bank: India pays off. Please collect, Madam. The \\n\\ndivination was wild. He spun the globe again until the axial \\n\\nmountings rattled; \"days\" flitted by as briefest instants– \\n\\nIn a reverse sense, he noticed suddenly. If Mother Gaia \\n\\npirouetted in the same sense, the sun and other passing \\n\\nscenery would rise in the west and set in the east. \\n\\nReversing time thereby? Said the namesake of my \\n\\nnamesake: Move not, O Sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O \\n\\nMoon, toward the valley– a neat trick, forsooth, and useful \\n\\nin these times too. Back up, O Sun, et tu, Luna, recedite in \\n\\norbitas reversas. . . . He kept spinning the globe in \\n\\nreverse, as if hoping the simulacrum of Earth possessed \\n\\nthe Chronos for unwinding time. A third of a million turns \\n\\nmight unwind enough days to carry it back to the Diluvium \\n\\nIgnis. Better to use a motor and spin it back to the \\n\\nbeginning of Man. He stopped it again with his thumb; \\n\\nonce more the divination was wild. \\n\\nStill he lingered in the office and dreaded going \"home\" \\n\\nagain. \"Home\" was only across the highway, in the \\n\\nhaunted halls of those ancient buildings whose walls still \\n\\ncontained stones which had been the nibbled concrete of a \\n\\ncivilization that had died eighteen centuries ago. Crossing \\n\\nthe highway to the old abbey was like crossing an eon. \\n\\nHere in the new aluminum and glass buildings, he was a \\n\\ntechnician at a workbench where events were only \\n\\nphenomena to be observed with regard for their How, not \\n\\nquestioning their Why. On this side of the road, the falling \\n\\nof Lucifer was only an inference derived by cold arithmetic \\n\\nfrom the chatter of radiation counters, from the sudden \\n\\nswing of a seismograph pen. But in the old abbey, he \\n\\nceased to be a technician; over there he was a monk of \\n\\nChrist, a booklegger and memorizer in the community of \\n\\nLeibowitz. Over there, the question would be: \"Why, Lord, \\n\\nwhy?\" But the question had already come, and the abbot \\n\\nhad said: \"See me.\" \\n\\nJoshua reached for his bindlestiff and went to obey the \\n\\nsummons of his ruler. To avoid meeting Mrs. Grales, he \\n\\nconversations with the bicephalous old tomato woman. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Twenty-five  \\n\\nThe dike of secrecy had broken. Several dauntless Dutch \\n\\nboys were swept away by the raging tide; the tide swept \\n\\nthem right out of Texarkana to their country estates where \\n\\nthey became unavailable for comment. Others remained at \\n\\ntheir posts and staunchly tried to plug new leaks. But the \\n\\nfall of certain isotopes in the wind created a universal \\n\\nbyword, spoken on street corners and screamed by banner \\n\\nheadlines: LUCIFER IS FALLEN. \\n\\nThe Minister of Defense, his uniform immaculate, his \\n\\nmake-up unsmeared, and his equanimity unruffled, again \\n\\nfaced the journalistic fraternity; this time the press \\n\\nconference was televised throughout the Christian \\n\\nCoalition. \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: Your Lordship appears rather calm, in \\n\\nthe face of the facts. Two violations of international law, \\n\\nboth defined by treaty as warlike acts, have recently \\n\\noccurred. Doesn\\'t that worry the War Ministry at all? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: Madam, as you very well know, we \\n\\ndo not have a War Ministry here; we have a Defense \\n\\nMinistry. And as far as I know, only one violation of \\n\\ninternational law has occurred. Would you mind \\n\\nacquainting me with the other? \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: Which one are you not acquainted with– \\n\\nthe disaster in Itu Wan, or the warning shot over the far \\n\\nSouth Pacific? \\n\\nDEFENSE MIM5TER (suddenly stern): Surely Madam \\n\\nintends nothing seditious, but your question seems to give \\n\\ncomfort, if not credence, to the utterly false Asian charges \\n\\nthat the so-called Itu Wan disaster was the result of a \\n\\nweapon test by us and not by them! \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: If it does, I invite you to throw me in \\n\\njail. The question was based on a Near East neutralist \\n\\naccount, which reported that the Itu Wan disaster was the \\n\\nresult of an Asian weapon test, underground, which broke \\n\\nfree. The same account said that the Itu Wan test was \\n\\nsighted from our satellites and immediately answered by a \\n\\nspace-to-earth warning shot southeast of New Zealand. \\n\\nBut now that you suggest it, was the Itu Wan disaster also \\n\\nthe result of a weapon test by us? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER (with forced patience): I recognize the \\n\\njournalistic requirement of objectivity. But to suggest that \\n\\nHis Supremacy\\'s government would deliberately violate– \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: His Supremacy is an eleven-year-old \\n\\nboy, and to call it his government is not only archaic, but a \\n\\nhighly dishonorable– even cheap!– attempt to shift the \\n\\nresponsibility for a full denial from your own– \\n\\nMODERATOR: Madam! Please restrain the tenor of your– \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: Overlook it, overlook it! Madam, you \\n\\nhave my full denial if you must dignify the fantastic \\n\\nof a weapon test by us. Nor do I have any knowledge of \\n\\nany other recent nuclear detonation. \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: Thank you. \\n\\nMODERATOR: I believe the editor of the Texarkana \\n\\nStar-Insight has been trying to speak. \\n\\nEDITOR: Thank you. I should like to ask, Your Lordship: \\n\\nWhat did happen in Itu Wan? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: We have no nationals in that area; \\n\\nwere broken during the last world crisis. I can, therefore, \\n\\nonly rely upon indirect evidence, and the somewhat \\n\\nconflicting neutralist accounts. \\n\\nEDITOR: That is to be understood. \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: Very well, then, I gather there was a \\n\\nsubsurface nuclear detonation– in the megaton range– and \\n\\nit got out of hand. It was rather obviously a test of some \\n\\nsort. Whether it was a weapon or, as some Asia-fringe \\n\\n\"neutrals\" claim, an attempt to divert an underground \\n\\nriver– it was clearly illegal, and adjoining countries are \\n\\npreparing a protest to the World Court. \\n\\nEDITOR: Is there any risk of war? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: I foresee none. But as you know, we \\n\\nhave certain detachments of our armed forces which are \\n\\nsubject to conscription by the World Court to enforce its \\n\\ndecisions, if needed. I foresee no such need, but I cannot \\n\\nspeak for the court. \\n\\nFIRST REPORTER: But the Asian coalition has threatened  \\n\\nan immediate all-out strike against our space installations \\n\\nif the court does not take action against us. What if the \\n\\ncourt is slow in acting? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: No ultimatum has been delivered. \\n\\nThe threat was for Asian home consumption, as I see it; to \\n\\ncover their blunder in Itu Wan. \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: How is your abiding faith in Motherhood \\n\\ntoday, Lord Ragelle? \\n\\nDEFENSE MINISTER: I hope Motherhood has at least as \\n\\nmuch abiding faith in me as I have in Motherhood. \\n\\nLADY REPORTER: You deserve at least that much, I\\'m \\n\\nsure. \\n\\nThe news conference, radiated from the relay satellite \\n\\ntwenty-two thousand miles from Earth, bathed most of the \\n\\nWestern Hemisphere with the flickering VHF signal which \\n\\ncarried such intelligence to the panelescent wall screens of \\n\\nthe multitudes. One among the multitudes, Abbot Dom \\n\\nZerchi switched off the set. \\n\\nHe paced for a while, waiting for Joshua, trying not to \\n\\nthink. But \"not thinking\" proved impossible. \\n\\nagain and again? Have we no choice but to play the \\n\\nPhoenix, in an unending sequence of rise and fall? Assyria, \\n\\nBabylon, Egypt, Greece, Carthage, Rome, the Empires of \\n\\nCharlemagne and the Turk. Ground to dust and plowed \\n\\nwith salt. Spain, France, Britain, America– burned into the \\n\\noblivion of the centuries. And again and again and again. \\n\\nAre we doomed to it, Lord, chained to the pendulum of our \\n\\nown mad clockwork, helpless to halt its swing? \\n\\nThis time, it will swing us clean to oblivion, he thought. \\n\\nThe feeling of desperation passed abruptly when Brother \\n\\nPat brought him the second telegram. The abbot ripped it \\n\\nhere yet, Brother?\" \\n\\n\"Waiting outside, Reverend Father.\" \\n\\n\"Send him in.\" \\n\\n\"Ho, Brother, shut the door and turn on the silencer. Then \\n\\nread this.\" \\n\\nJoshua glanced at the first telegram. \"An answer from New \\n\\nRome?\" \\n\\n\"It came this morning. But turn on that silencer first. \\n\\nWe\\'ve got things to discuss.\" \\n\\nJoshua closed the door and flipped a wall switch. \\n\\nConcealed loudspeakers squealed a brief protest. When the \\n\\nsquealing stopped, the room\\'s acoustic properties seemed \\n\\nsuddenly changed. \\n\\nDom Zerchi waved him toward a chair, and he read the \\n\\nfirst telegram in silence. \\n\\n\". . . no action whatever to be taken by you in connection \\n\\nwith Quo peregrinatur grex,\" he read aloud. \\n\\n\"You\\'ll have to shout with that thing on,\" said the abbot, \\n\\nindicating the silencer. \"What?\" \\n\\n\"I was just reading. So the plan is canceled?\" \\n\\nthis afternoon.\" The abbot tossed him the second \\n\\ntelegram:\\n\\n IGNORE EARLIER MESSAGE OF THIS DATE. \"QUO \\n\\nPEREGRINATUR\" TO BE REACTIVATED IMMEDIATELY BY \\n\\nREQUEST OF HOLY FATHER.\\n\\n PREPARE CADRE TO LEAVE WITHIN THREE DAYS. WAIT \\n\\nFOR CONFIRMING WIRE BEFORE DEPARTURE. REPORT \\n\\nANY VACANCIES IN CADRE ORGANIZATION. BEGIN \\n\\nCONDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF PLAN. \\n\\nERIC CARDINAL ROFFSTRAFF, VICAR APOST. EXTRATERR. \\n\\n PROVINCIAE \\n\\nThe monk\\'s face lost color. He replaced the telegram on \\n\\nthe desk and sat back in his chair, lips tight together. \\n\\n\"You know what Quo peregrinatur is?\"  \\n\\n\"I know what it is, Domne, but not in detail.\"  \\n\\n\"Well, it started as a plan to send a few priests along with \\n\\na colony group heading for Alpha Centauri. But that didn\\'t \\n\\nwork out, because it takes bishops to ordain priests, and \\n\\nafter the first generation of colonists, more priests would \\n\\nhave to be Sent, and so on. The question boiled down to \\n\\nan argument about whether the colonies would last, and if \\n\\nso, should provision be made to insure the apostolic \\n\\nsuccession on colony planets without recourse to Earth? \\n\\nYou know what that would mean?\" \\n\\n\"Sending at least three bishops, I imagine.\" \\n\\n\"Yes, and that seemed a little silly. The colony groups have \\n\\nall been rather small. But during the last world crisis, Quo \\n\\nperegrinatur became an emergency plan for perpetuating \\n\\nthe Church on the colony planets if the worst came to pass \\n\\non Earth. We have a ship.\" \\n\\n\"A starship?\" \\n\\n\"No less. And we have a crew capable of managing it.\" \\n\\n\"Where?\"  \\n\\n\"We have the crew right here.\"  \\n\\n\"Here at the abbey? But who– ?\" Joshua stopped. His face \\n\\ngrew even grayer than before. \"But, Domne, my \\n\\nexperience in space has been entirely in orbital vehicles, \\n\\nnot in starships! Before Nancy died and I went to the \\n\\nCisterc– \" \\n\\n\"I know all about that. There are others with starship \\n\\nexperience. You know who they are. There are even jokes \\n\\nabout the number of ex-spacers that seem to feel a \\n\\nvocation to our Order. It\\'s no accident, of course. And you \\n\\nremember when you were a postulant, how you were \\n\\nquizzed about your experience in space?\" \\n\\nJoshua nodded. \\n\\n\"You must also remember being asked about your \\n\\nwillmgness to go to space again, if the Order asked it of \\n\\nyou.\" \\n\\n\"Yes.\" \\n\\n\"Then you were not wholly unaware that you were \\n\\nconditionally assigned to Quo peregrinatur, if it ever came \\n\\nto pass?\"  \\n\\n\"I– I guess I was afraid it was so, m\\'Lord.\"  \\n\\n\"Afraid?\"  \\n\\n\"Suspected, rather. Afraid too, a little, because I\\'ve always  \\n\\nhoped to spend the rest of my life in the Order.\"  \\n\\n\"As a priest?\"  \\n\\n\"That– well, I haven\\'t yet decided.\"  \\n\\n\"Quo pereginatur will not involve releasing you from your  \\n\\nvows or mean abandoning the Order.\"  \\n\\n\"The Order goes too?\"  \\n\\nZerchi smiled \"And the Memorabilia with it.\"  \\n\\n\"The whole kit-and– Oh, you mean on microfilm. Where  \\n\\nto?\"  \\n\\n\"The Centaurus Colony.\"  \\n\\n\"How long would we be gone, Domne?\" \\n\\n\"If you go, you\\'ll never come back.\" \\n\\nThe monk breathed heavily and stared at the second \\n\\ntelegram without seeming to see it. He scratched his beard \\n\\nand appeared bemused. \\n\\n\"Three questions,\" said the abbot. \"Don\\'t answer now, but \\n\\nstart thinking about them, and think hard. First, are you \\n\\nwilling to go? Second, do you have a vocation to the \\n\\npriesthood? Third, are you willing to lead the group? And \\n\\nby willing, I don\\'t mean \\'willing under obedience\\'; I mean \\n\\nenthusiastic, or willing to get that way. Think it over; you \\n\\nhave three days to think– maybe less.\" \\n\\nModern change had made but few incursions upon the \\n\\nbuildings and the grounds of the ancient monastery. To \\n\\nprotect the old buildings against the encroachment of a \\n\\nmore impatient architecture, new additions had been made \\n\\noutside the walls and even across the highway--sometimes \\n\\nat the expense of convenience. The old refectory had been \\n\\ncondemned because of a buckling roof, and it was \\n\\nnecessary to cross the highway in order to reach the new \\n\\nrefectory. The inconvenience was somewhat mitigated by \\n\\nthe culvert walkunder through which the brothers marched \\n\\ndaily to meals. \\n\\nsame road used by pagan armies, pilgrims, peasants, \\n\\ndonkey carts, nomads, wild horsemen out of the East, \\n\\nartillery, tanks, and ten-ton trucks. Its traffic had gushed \\n\\nor trickled or dripped, according to the age and season. \\n\\nOnce before, long ago, there had been six lanes and robot \\n\\ntraffic. Then the traffic had stopped, the paving had \\n\\ncracked, and sparse grass grew in the cracks after an \\n\\noccasional rain. Dust had covered it. Desert dwellers had \\n\\ndug up its broken concrete for the building of hovels and \\n\\nbarricades. Erosion made it a desert trail, crossing \\n\\nwilderness. But now there were six lanes and robot traffic, \\n\\nas before. \\n\\n\"Traffic\\'s light tonight,\" the abbot observed as they left the \\n\\nold main gate. \"Let\\'s hike across. That tunnel can be \\n\\nsuffocating after a dust storm. Or don\\'t you feel like \\n\\ndodging buses?\" \\n\\n\"Let\\'s go,\" Brother Joshua agreed.  \\n\\nLow-slung trucks with feeble headlights (useful only for \\n\\nwarning purposes) sped mindlessly past them with whining \\n\\ntires and moaning turbines. With dish antennae they \\n\\nwatched the road, and with magnetic feelers they felt at \\n\\nthe guiding strips of steel in the roadbed and were given \\n\\nguidance thereby, as they rushed along the pink, \\n\\nfluorescent river of oiled concrete. Economic corpuscles in \\n\\nan artery of Man, the behemoths charged heedlessly past \\n\\nthe two monks who dodged them from lane to lane. To be \\n\\nfelled by one of them was to be run over by truck after \\n\\ntruck until a safety cruiser found the flattened imprint of a \\n\\nman on the pavement and stopped to clean it up. The \\n\\nautopilots\\' sensing mechanisms were better at detecting \\n\\nmasses of metal than masses of flesh and bone. \\n\\n\"This was a mistake,\" Joshua said as they reached the \\n\\ncenter island and paused for breath. \"Look who\\'s standing \\n\\nover there.\" \\n\\nThe abbot peered for a moment, then clapped his \\n\\nforehead. \"Mrs. Grales! I clean forgot: it\\'s her night to \\n\\nprowl me down. She\\'s sold her tomatoes to the sisters\\' \\n\\nrefectory, and now she\\'s after me again.\" \\n\\n\"After you? She was there last night, and the night before \\n\\ntoo. I thought she was waiting for a ride. What does she \\n\\nwant from you?\" \\n\\n\"Oh, nothing really. She\\'s finished gypping the sisters on \\n\\nthe price of tomatoes, and now she\\'ll donate the surplus \\n\\nprofit to me for the poor box. It\\'s a little ritual. I don\\'t \\n\\nmind the ritual. It\\'s what comes afterwards that\\'s bad. \\n\\nYou\\'ll see.\" \\n\\n\"Shall we go back?\" \\n\\n\"And hurt her feelings? Nonsense. She\\'s seen us by now. \\n\\nCome on.\" \\n\\nThey plunged into the thin stream of trucks again. \\n\\nThe two-headed woman and her six-legged dog waited \\n\\nwith an empty vegetable basket by the new gate; the \\n\\nwoman crooned softly to the dog. Four of the dog\\'s legs \\n\\nwere healthy legs, but an extra pair dangled uselessly at \\n\\nits sides. As for the woman, one head was as useless as \\n\\nthe extra legs of the dog. It was a small head, a cherubic \\n\\nhead, but it never opened its eyes. It gave no evidence of \\n\\nsharing in her breathing or her understanding. It lolled \\n\\nuselessly on one shoulder, blind, deaf, mute, and only \\n\\nvegetatively alive. Perhaps it lacked a brain, for it showed \\n\\nno sign of independent consciousness or personality. Her \\n\\nother face had aged, grown wrinkled, but the superfluous \\n\\nhead retained the features of infancy, although it had been \\n\\ntoughened by the gritty wind and darkened by the desert \\n\\nsun. \\n\\nThe old woman curtsied at their approach, and her dog \\n\\ndrew back with a snarl. \"Evenin\\', Father Zerchi,\" she \\n\\ndrawled, \"a most pleasant evenin\\' to yer– and to yer, \\n\\nBrother.\" \\n\\n\"Why, hello, Mrs. Grales– \" \\n\\nThe dog barked, bristled, and began a frenzied dance, \\n\\nfeinting toward the abbot\\'s ankles with fangs bared for \\n\\nslashing. Mrs. Grales promptly struck her pet with the \\n\\nvegetable basket. The dog\\'s teeth slashed the basket; the \\n\\ndog turned on its mistress. Mrs. Grales kept it away with \\n\\nthe basket; and after receiving a few resounding whacks, \\n\\nthe dog retired to sit growling in the gateway. \\n\\n\"What a fine mood Priscilla\\'s in,\" Zerchi observed \\n\\npleasantly. \"Is she going to have pups?\" \\n\\n\"Beg shriv\\'ness, yer honors,\" said Mrs. Grales, \"but\\'s not \\n\\nthe pup\\'s motherful condition as makes her so, devil fret \\n\\nher! but \\'tis \\'at man of mine. He\\'s witched the piteous pup, \\n\\nhe has– for love of witchin\\'– and it makes her \\'feared of \\n\\nall. I beg yer honors\\' shriv\\'ness for her naughties.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s all right. Well, good night, Mrs. Grales.\" \\n\\nBut escape proved not that easy. She caught at the \\n\\nabbot\\'s sleeve and smiled her toothlessly irresistible smile. \\n\\n\"A minute, Father, only a minute for \\'n old tumater \\n\\nwoman, if ye have it to spare.\" \\n\\n\"Why, of course! I\\'d be glad– \" \\n\\nJoshua gave the abbot a sidelong grin and went over to \\n\\nnegotiate with the dog concerning right of way. Priscilla \\n\\neyed him with plain contempt. \\n\\n\"Here, Father, here,\" Mrs. Grales was saying. \"Take a little \\n\\nsomething for yer box. Here– \" Coins rattled while Zerchi \\n\\nprotested. \"No, here, take of it, take of it,\" she insisted. \\n\\n\"Oh, I know as how ye always say, by fret! but I be not so \\n\\npoor\\'s ye might think on me. And ye do good work. If ye \\n\\ndon\\'t take of it, that no-good man of mine\\'ll have it from  \\n\\nme, and do him the Devil\\'s work. Here– I sold my \\n\\ntumaters, and I got my price, near, and I bought my feed \\n\\nfor the week and even a play-pretty for Rachel. I want ye \\n\\nto have of it. Here.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s very kind. . .\" \\n\\n\"Grryumpf!\" came an authoritative bark from the gateway. \\n\\n\"Grryumpf! Rowf! rowf! RrmrrOWWFF!\"– followed by a \\n\\nrapid sequence of yaps, yeeps, and Priscilla\\'s howling in \\n\\nfull retreat. \\n\\nJoshua came wandering back with his hands in his sleeves. \\n\\n\"Are you wounded, man?\" \\n\\n\"Grryumpf!\" said the monk. \\n\\n\"What on earth did you do to her?\" \\n\\n\"Grryumpf!\" Brother Joshua repeated. \"Rowf! Rowf! \\n\\nRrrrrrOWWFF!\"– then explained: \"Priscilla believes in \\n\\nwerewolves. The yelping was hers. We can get past the \\n\\ngate now.\" \\n\\nabbot\\'s sleeve. \"Only a minute more of yer, Father, and I\\'ll \\n\\nkeep ye no longer. It\\'s little Rachel I wanted to see yer \\n\\nabout. There\\'s the baptism and the christenin\\' to be \\n\\nthought of, and I wished to ask yer if ye\\'d do the honor of– \\n\\n\" \\n\\n\"Mrs. Grales,\" he put in gently, \"go see your own parish \\n\\npriest. He should handle these matters, not I. I have no \\n\\nparish– only the abbey. Talk to Father Selo at Saint \\n\\nMichael\\'s. Our church doesn\\'t even have a font. Women \\n\\naren\\'t permitted, except in the tribune– \" \\n\\n\"The sister\\'s chapel has a font, and women can– \" \\n\\n\"It\\'s for Father Selo, not for me. It has to be recorded in \\n\\nyour own parish. Only as an emergency could I– \" \\n\\n\"Ay, ay, that I know, but I saw Father Selo. I brought \\n\\nRachel to his church and the fool of a man would not touch \\n\\nher.\" \\n\\n\"He refused to baptize Rachel?\" \\n\\n\"That he did, the fool of a man.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s a priest you\\'re talking of, Mrs. Grales, and no fool, for  \\n\\nI know him well. He must have his reasons for refusing. If \\n\\nyou don\\'t agree with his reasons, then see someone else– \\n\\nbut not a monastic priest. Talk to the pastor at Saint \\n\\nMaisie\\'s perhaps.\" \\n\\n\"Ay, and that too have I done. . . .\" She launched into \\n\\nwhat promised to be a prolonged account of her \\n\\nskirmishings on behalf of the unbaptized Rachel. The \\n\\nmonks listened patiently at first, but while Joshua was \\n\\nwatching her, he seized the abbot\\'s arm above the elbow; \\n\\nhis fingers gradually dug into Zerchi\\'s arm until the abbot \\n\\nwinced in pain and tore the fingers away with his free \\n\\nhand. \\n\\n\"What are you doing?\" he whispered, but then noticed the \\n\\nmonk\\'s expression. Joshua\\'s eyes were fixed on the old \\n\\nwoman as if she were a cockatrice. Zerchi followed his \\n\\ngaze, but saw nothing stranger than usual; her extra head \\n\\nwas half concealed by a sort of veil, but Brother Joshua \\n\\nhad certainly seen that often enough. \\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry, Mrs. Grales,\" Zerchi interrupted as soon as she \\n\\nfell short of breath. \"I really must go now. I\\'ll tell you \\n\\nwhat: I\\'ll call Father Selo for you, but that\\'s all I can do. \\n\\nWe\\'ll see you again, I\\'m sure.\" \\n\\n\"Thank yer kindly, and beg yer shriv\\'ness for keeping yer.\" \\n\\n\"Good night, Mrs. Grales.\" \\n\\nThey entered the gate and walked toward the refectory. \\n\\nJoshua thumped the heel of his hand against his temple \\n\\nseveral times as if to jar something back into place. \\n\\n\"Why were you staring at her like that?\" the abbot \\n\\ndemanded. \"I thought it rude.\" \\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you notice?\" \\n\\n\"Notice what?\" \\n\\n\"Then you didn\\'t notice. Well . . . Let it pass. But who is \\n\\nRachel? Why won\\'t they baptize the child? Is she the \\n\\nwoman\\'s daughter?\" \\n\\nThe abbot smiled without humor. \"That\\'s what Mrs. Grales \\n\\ncontends. But there\\'s some question as to whether Rachel \\n\\nis her daughter, her sister-or merely an excrescence \\n\\ngrowing out of her shoulder.\" \\n\\n\"Rachel!– her other head?\"  \\n\\n\"Don\\'t shout so. She\\'ll hear you yet.\" \\n\\n\"And she wants it baptized?\" \\n\\n\"Rather urgently, wouldn\\'t you say? It seems to be an \\n\\nobsession.\" \\n\\nJoshua waved his arms. \"How do they settle such things?\" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, and I don\\'t want to know. I\\'m grateful to \\n\\nHeaven that it\\'s not up to me to figure it out. If it were a \\n\\nsimple case of Siamese twins, it would be easy. But it isn\\'t. \\n\\nThe oldtimers say Rachel wasn\\'t there when Mrs. Grales \\n\\nwas born.\" \\n\\n\"A farmers\\' fable!\" \\n\\n\"Perhaps. But some are willing to tell it under oath. How \\n\\nmany souls has an old lady with an extra head– a head \\n\\nthat \\'just grew\\'? Things like that cause ulcers in high \\n\\nplaces, my son. Now, what was it you noticed? Why were \\n\\nyou staring at her and trying to pinch my arm off like \\n\\nthat?\" \\n\\nThe monk was slow to answer. \"It smiled at me,\" he said \\n\\nat last. \\n\\n\"What smiled?\"  \\n\\n\"Her extra, uh– Rachel. She smiled. I thought she was  \\n\\ngoing to wake up.\"  \\n\\nThe abbot stopped him in the refectory\\'s entranceway and  \\n\\npeered at him curiously.  \\n\\n\"She smiled,\" the monk repeated very earnestly.  \\n\\n\"You imagined it.\"  \\n\\n\"Yes, m\\'Lord.\"  \\n\\n\"Then look like you imagined it.\"  \\n\\nBrother Joshua tried. \"I can\\'t,\" he admitted.  \\n\\nThe abbot dropped the old woman\\'s coins in the poor box.  \\n\\n\"Let\\'s go on inside,\" he said.  \\n\\nThe new refectory was functional, chromium befixtured, \\n\\nacoustically tailored, and germicidally illuminated. Gone \\n\\nwere the smoke-blackened stones, the tallow lamps, the \\n\\nwooden bowls and cellar-ripened cheeses. Except for the \\n\\ncruciform seating arrangement and a rank of images along \\n\\none wall, the place resembled an industrial lunchroom. Its \\n\\natmosphere had changed, as had the atmosphere of the \\n\\nentire abbey. After ages of striving to preserve remnants \\n\\nof culture from a civilization long dead, the monks had \\n\\nwatched the rise of a new and mightier civilization. The old \\n\\ntasks had been completed; new ones were found. The past \\n\\nwas venerated and exhibited in glass cases, but it was no \\n\\nlonger the present. The Order conformed to the times, to \\n\\nan age of uranium and steel and flaring rocketry, amid the \\n\\ngrowl of heavy industry and the high thin whine of star \\n\\ndrive converters. The Order conformed– at least in \\n\\nsuperficial ways. \\n\\n\"Accedite ad eum,\" the Reader intoned. \\n\\nThe robed legions stood restlessly at their places during \\n\\nthe reading. No food had yet appeared. The tables were \\n\\nbare of dishes. Supper had been deferred. The organism, \\n\\nthe community whose cells were men, whose life had \\n\\nflowed through seventy generations, seemed tense \\n\\ntonight, seemed to sense a note amiss tonight, seemed \\n\\naware, through the connaturality of its membership, of \\n\\nwhat had been told to only a few. The organism lived as a \\n\\nbody, worshiped and worked as a body, and at times \\n\\nseemed dimly conscious as a mind that infused its \\n\\nmembers and whispered to itself and to Another in the \\n\\nlingua prima, baby tongue of the species. Perhaps the \\n\\ntension was increased as much by faint snort-growl of \\n\\npractice rocketry from the distant anti-missile missile \\n\\nrange as by the unexpected postponement of the meal. \\n\\nThe abbot rapped for silence, then gestured his prior, \\n\\nFather Lehy, toward the lectern. The prior looked pained \\n\\nfor a moment before speaking. \\n\\n\"We all regret the necessity,\" he said at last, \"of \\n\\nsometimes disturbing the quiet of contemplative life with \\n\\nnews from the outside world. But we must remember too \\n\\nthat we are here to pray for the world and its salvation, as \\n\\nfor our own. Especially now, the world could use some \\n\\npraying for.\" He paused to glance at Zerchi. \\n\\nThe abbot nodded. \\n\\n\"Lucifer is fallen,\" said the priest, and stopped. He stood \\n\\nthere looking down at the lectern as if suddenly struck \\n\\ndumb. \\n\\nZerchi arose. \"That is Brother Joshua\\'s inference, by the \\n\\nway,\" he interposed. \"The Regency Council of the Atlantic \\n\\nConfederacy has said nothing to speak of. The dynasty has \\n\\nissued no statements. We know little more than we knew \\n\\nyesterday, except that the World Court is meeting in \\n\\nemergency session, and that the Defense Interior people \\n\\nare moving fast. There is a defense alert, and we\\'ll be \\n\\naffected, but don\\'t be disturbed. Father– ?\" \\n\\n\"Thank you, Domne,\" said the prior, seeming to regain his \\n\\nvoice as Dom Zerchi was seated again. \"Now, Reverend \\n\\nFather Abbot asked me to make the following \\n\\nannouncements: \\n\\n\"First, for the next three days we shall sing the Little Office \\n\\nof Our Lady before Matins, asking her intercession for \\n\\npeace. \\n\\n\"Second, general instructions for civil defense in the event \\n\\nof a space-strike or missile-attack alert are available on \\n\\nthe table by the entrance. Everybody take one. If you\\'ve \\n\\nread it, read it again. \\n\\n\"Third, in the event that an attack warning is sounded, the \\n\\nfollowing brothers are to report immediately to Old Abbey \\n\\ncourtyard for special instructions. If no attack warning \\n\\ncomes, the same brothers will report there anyway day \\n\\nafter tomorrow morning right after Matins and Lauds. \\n\\nNames– Brothers Joshua, Christopher, Augustin, James, \\n\\nSamuel– \" \\n\\nThe monks listened with quiet tension, betraying no \\n\\nemotion. There were twenty-seven names in all, but no \\n\\nnovices were among them. Some were eminent scholars, \\n\\nthere were a janitor and a cook as well. At first hearing, \\n\\none might assume that the names had been drawn from a \\n\\nbox. By the time Father Lehy had finished the list, some of \\n\\nthe brothers were eying each other curiously. \\n\\n\"And this same group will report to the dispensary for a \\n\\ncomplete physical examination tomorrow after Prime,\" the \\n\\nprior finished. He turned to look questioningly at Dom \\n\\nZerchi. \"Domne?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, just one thing,\" said the abbot, approaching the \\n\\nlectern. \"Brothers, let us not assume that there is going to \\n\\nbe war. Let\\'s remind ourselves that Lucifer has been with \\n\\nus– this time– for nearly two centuries. And was dropped \\n\\nonly twice, in sizes smaller than megaton. We all know \\n\\nwhat could happen, if there\\'s war. The genetic festering is \\n\\nstill with us from the last time Man tried to eradicate \\n\\nhimself. Back then, in the Saint Leibowitz\\' time, maybe \\n\\nthey didn\\'t know what would happen. Or perhaps they did \\n\\nknow, but could not quite believe it until they tried it– like \\n\\na child who knows what a loaded pistol is supposed to do, \\n\\nbut who never pulled a trigger before. They had not yet \\n\\nseen a billion corpses. They had not seen the still-born, the \\n\\nmonstrous, the dehumanized, the blind. They had not yet \\n\\nseen the madness and the murder and the blotting out of \\n\\nreason. Then they did it, and then they saw it. \\n\\n\"Now– now the princes, the presidents, the praesidiums, \\n\\nnow they know– with dead certainty. They can know it by \\n\\nthe children they beget and send to asylums for the \\n\\ndeformed. They know it, and they\\'ve kept the peace. Not \\n\\nChrist\\'s peace, certainly, but peace, until lately– with only \\n\\ntwo warlike incidents in as many centuries. Now they have \\n\\nthe bitter certainty. My sons, they cannot do it again. Only \\n\\na race of madmen could do it again– \" \\n\\nHe stopped speaking. Someone was smiling. It was only a \\n\\nsmall smile, but in the midst of a sea of grave faces it \\n\\nstood out like a dead fly in a bowl of cream. Dom Zerchi \\n\\nfrowned. The old man kept on smiling wryly. He sat at the \\n\\n\"beggar\\'s table\" with three other transient tramps– an old \\n\\nfellow with a brushy beard, stained yellow about the chin. \\n\\nAs a jacket, he wore a burlap bag with armholes. He \\n\\ncontinued to smile at Zerchi. He looked old as a rain-worn \\n\\ncrag, and a suitable candidate for a Maundy laying. Zerchi \\n\\nwondered if he were about to stand up and make an \\n\\nannouncement to his hosts– or blow a ramshorn at them, \\n\\nperhaps?-- but that was only an illusion generated by the \\n\\nsmile. He quickly dismissed the feeling that he had seen \\n\\nthe old man before, somewhere. He concluded his \\n\\nremarks. \\n\\nOn his way back to his place, he paused. The beggar \\n\\nnodded pleasantly at his host. Zerchi came nearer. \\n\\n\"Who are you, if I may ask. Have I seen you somewhere \\n\\nbefore?\" \\n\\n\"*** *****\" \\n\\n\"What?\" \\n\\n\"Latzar shemi,\" the beggar repeated. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t quite– \"  \\n\\n\"Call me Lazarus, then,\" said the old one, and chuckled. \\n\\nDom Zerchi shook his head and moved on. Lazarus? There \\n\\nwas, in the region, an old wives\\' tale to the effect that– but \\n\\nwhat a shoddy sort of myth that was. Raised up by Christ \\n\\nbut still not a Christian, they said. And yet he could not \\n\\nescape the feeling that he had seen the old man \\n\\nsomewhere. \\n\\n\"Let the bread be brought for blessing,\" he called, and the \\n\\ndeferment of supper was at an end. \\n\\nAfter the prayers, the abbot glanced toward the beggars\\' \\n\\ntable again. The old man was merely fanning his soup with \\n\\na sort of basket hat. Zerchi dismissed it with a shrug, and \\n\\nthe meal began in solemn silence. \\n\\nCompline, the Church\\'s night prayer, seemed especially \\n\\nprofound that night. \\n\\nBut Joshua slept badly afterwards. In a dream he met Mrs.  \\n\\nGrales again. There was a surgeon who sharpened a knife, \\n\\nsaying, \"This deformity must be removed before it \\n\\nbecomes malignant.\" And the Rachel face opened its eyes \\n\\nand tried to speak to Joshua, but he could hear her only \\n\\nfaintly, and understand her not at all. \\n\\n\"Accurate am I the exception,\" she seemed to be saying, \"I \\n\\ncommensurate the deception. Am.\" \\n\\nHe could make nothing of it, but he tried to reach through \\n\\nto save her. There seemed to be a rubbery wall of glass in \\n\\nthe way. He paused and tried to read her lips. I am the, I \\n\\nam the-- \"I am the Immaculate Conception,\" came the \\n\\ndream whisper. He tried to tear his way through the \\n\\nrubbery glass to save her from the knife, but it was too \\n\\nlate, and there was a great deal of blood afterwards. He \\n\\nawoke from the blasphemous nightmare with a shudder \\n\\nMrs. Grales again. \\n\\nIt was a troubled night, a night that belonged to Lucifer. It \\n\\nwas the night of the Atlantic assault against the Asian \\n\\nspace installations. \\n\\nIn swift retaliation, an ancient city died. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter  \\n\\nChapter Twenty-six  \\n\\n\"This is your Emergency Warning Network,\" the announcer \\n\\nwas saying when Joshua entered the abbot\\'s study after \\n\\nMatins of the following day, \"bringing you the latest \\n\\nbulletin on the pattern of fallout from the enemy missile \\n\\nassault on Texarkana. . . .\" \\n\\n\"You sent for me, Domne?\" \\n\\nZerchi waved him to silence and toward a seat. The \\n\\npriest\\'s face looked drawn and bloodless, a steel-gray \\n\\nmask of icy self-control. To Joshua, he seemed to have \\n\\nshrunk in size, to have aged since nightfall. They listened \\n\\ngloomily to the voice which waxed and waned at \\n\\nfour-second intervals as the broadcasting stations were \\n\\nswitched on and off the air as an impediment to enemy \\n\\ndirection-finding equipment: \\n\\n\". . . but first, an announcement just released by the \\n\\nSupreme Command. The royal family is safe. I repeat: the \\n\\nroyal family is known to be safe. The Regency Council is \\n\\nsaid to have been absent from the city when the enemy \\n\\nstruck. Outside of the disaster area, no civil disorders have \\n\\nbeen reported, and none is expected. \\n\\nNations, with a suspended proscription, involving the death \\n\\nsentence, against the responsible heads of government of \\n\\nboth nations. Being suspended, the sentence becomes \\n\\napplicable only if the decree is disobeyed. Both \\n\\ngovernments cabled to the court their immediate \\n\\nacknowledgment of the order, and there is, therefore, a \\n\\nstrong probability that the clash is at an end, a few hours \\n\\nafter it began as a preventative assault against certain \\n\\nillegal space installations. In a surprise attack, the space \\n\\nforces of the Atlantic Confederacy last night struck at three \\n\\nconcealed Asian missile sites located on the far side of the \\n\\nmoon, and totally destroyed one enemy space station \\n\\nknown to be involved in a guidance system for \\n\\nspace-to-earth missiles. It was expected that the enemy \\n\\nwould retaliate against our forces in space, but the \\n\\nbarbarous assault on our capital city was an act of \\n\\ndesperation which no one anticipated. \\n\\n\"Special bulletin: Our government has just announced its \\n\\nintention to honor the cease-fire for ten days if the enemy \\n\\nagrees to an immediate meeting of foreign ministers and \\n\\nmilitary commanders on Guam. The enemy is expected to \\n\\naccept.\" \\n\\n\"Ten days,\" the abbot groaned. \"It doesn\\'t give us enough  \\n\\ntime.\" \\n\\n\"The Asian radio, however, is still insisting that the recent \\n\\nthermonuclear disaster in Itu Wan, causing some eighty \\n\\nthousand casualties, was the work of an errant Atlantic \\n\\nmissile, and the destruction of the city of Texarkana was \\n\\ntherefore retaliation in kind. . . .\" \\n\\nThe abbot snapped off the set. \"Where\\'s the truth?\" he \\n\\nasked quietly. \"What\\'s to be believed? Or does it matter at \\n\\nall? When mass murder\\'s been answered with mass \\n\\nmurder, rape with rape, hate with hate, there\\'s no longer \\n\\nmuch meaning in asking whose ax is the bloodier. Evil, on \\n\\nevil, piled on evil. Was there any justification in our \\'police \\n\\naction\\' in space? How can we know? Certainly there was no \\n\\njustification for what they did– or was there? We only \\n\\nknow what that thing says, and that thing is a captive. The \\n\\nAsian radio has to say what will least displease its \\n\\ngovernment; ours has to say what will least displease our \\n\\nfine patriotic opinionated rabble, which is what, \\n\\ncoincidentally, the government wants it to say anyhow, so \\n\\nwhere\\'s the difference? Dear God, there must be half a \\n\\nmillion dead, if they hit Texarkana with the real thing. I \\n\\nfeel like saying words I\\'ve never even heard. Toad\\'s dung. \\n\\nHag pus. Gangrene of the soul. Immortal brain-rot. Do you  \\n\\nunderstand me, Brother? And Christ breathed the same \\n\\ncarrion air with us; how meek the Majesty of our Almighty \\n\\nGod! What an Infinite Sense of Humor– for Him to become \\n\\none of us!– King of the Universe, nailed on a cross as a \\n\\nYiddish Schlemiel by the likes of us. They say Lucifer was \\n\\ncast down for refusing to adore the Incarnate Word; the \\n\\nGod even of Cain! Why do they do it all again? \\n\\n\"Forgive me, I\\'m raving,\" he added, less to Joshua than to \\n\\nthe old woodcarving of Saint Leibowitz that stood in one \\n\\ncorner of the study. He had paused in his pacing to glance \\n\\nup at the face of the image. The image was old, very old. \\n\\nSome earlier ruler of the abbey had sent it down to a \\n\\nbasement storeroom to stand in dust and gloom while a \\n\\ndry-rot etched the wood, eating away the spring grain and \\n\\nleaving the summer grain so that the face seemed deeply \\n\\nlined. The saint wore a slightly satiric smile. Zerchi had \\n\\nrescued it from oblivion because of the smile. \\n\\n\"Did you see that old beggar in the refectory last night?\" \\n\\nhe asked irrelevantly, still peering curiously at the statue\\'s \\n\\nsmile. \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t notice, Domne. Why?\"  \\n\\n\"Never mind, I guess I\\'m just imagining it.\" He fingered \\n\\nthe mound of faggots where the wooden martyr stood. \\n\\nThat\\'s where all of us are standing now, he thought. On \\n\\nthe fat kindling of past sins. And some of them are mine. \\n\\nMine, Adam\\'s, Herod\\'s, Judas\\'s, Hannegan\\'s, mine. \\n\\nEverybody\\'s. Always culminates in the colossus of the \\n\\nState, somehow, drawing about itself the mantle of \\n\\ngodhood, being struck down by wrath of Heaven. Why? We \\n\\nshouted it loudly enough– God\\'s to be obeyed by nations \\n\\nas by men. Caesar\\'s to be God\\'s policeman, not His \\n\\nplenipotentiary successor, not His heir. To all ages, all \\n\\npeoples– \"Whoever exalts a race or a State or a particular \\n\\nform of State or the depositories of power . . . whoever \\n\\nraises these notions above their standard value and \\n\\ndivinizes them to an idolatrous level, distorts and perverts \\n\\nan order of the world planned and created by God. . . .\" \\n\\nWhere had that come from? Eleventh Pius, he thought, \\n\\nwithout certainty– eighteen centuries ago. But when \\n\\nCaesar got the means to destroy the world, wasn\\'t he \\n\\nalready divinized? Only by the consent of the people– \\n\\nsame rabble that shouted: \"Non habemus regem nisi \\n\\ncaesarem,\" when confronted by Him– God Incarnate, \\n\\nmocked and spat upon. Same rabble that martyred \\n\\nLeibowitz. . .  \\n\\n\"Caesar\\'s divinity is showing again.\"  \\n\\n\"Domne?\"  \\n\\n\"Let it pass. Are the brothers in the courtyard yet?\"  \\n\\n\"About half of them were when I passed. Shall I go see?\"  \\n\\n\"Do. Then come back here. I have something to say to you  \\n\\nbefore we join them.\"  \\n\\nBefore Joshua returned, the abbot had got the Quo  \\n\\nperegrinatur papers out of the wall safe.  \\n\\n\"Read the precis,\" he told the monk. \"Look at the table of  \\n\\norganization, read the procedural outline. You\\'ll have to  \\n\\nstudy the rest in detail, but later.\"  \\n\\nThe communicator buzzed loudly while Joshua was  \\n\\nreading. \"Reverend Father Jethrah Zerchi, Abbas, please,\"  \\n\\ndroned the voice of a robot operator.  \\n\\n\"Speaking.\"  \\n\\n\"Urgent priority wire from Sir Eric Cardinal Hoffstraff, New \\n\\nRome. There is no courier service at this hour. Shall I \\n\\nread?\" \\n\\n\"Yes, read the text of it. I\\'ll send someone down later to \\n\\npick up a copy.\" \\n\\n\"The text is as follows: \\'Grex peregrinus erit. Quam \\n\\nprimum est factum suscipiendum vobis, jussu Sactae \\n\\nSedis, Suscipite ergo operis partem ordini vestro propriam. \\n\\n. .\\'\" \\n\\n\"Can you read that back in Southwest translation?\" the \\n\\nabbot asked. \\n\\nThe operator complied, but in neither did the message \\n\\nseem to contain anything unexpected. It was a \\n\\nconfirmation of the plan and a request for speed. \\n\\n\"Receipt acknowledged,\" he said at last. \\n\\n\"Will there be a reply?\" \\n\\n\"Reply as follows: Eminentissimo Domino Eric Cardinali \\n\\nhas res disputandas iam coegi discessuros fratres ut hodie \\n\\nparati dimitti Romam prima aerisnave possint. End of \\n\\ntext.\" \\n\\n\"I read back: \\'Eminentissimo. . .\\'\"  \\n\\n\"All right, that\\'s all. Out.\"  \\n\\nJoshua had finished reading the precis. He closed the  \\n\\nportfolio and looked up slowly.  \\n\\n\"Are you ready to get nailed on it?\" Zerchi asked.  \\n\\n\"I– I\\'m not sure I understand.\" The monk\\'s face was pale.  \\n\\n\"I asked you three questions yesterday. I need the  \\n\\nanswers now.\"  \\n\\n\"I\\'m willing to go.\"  \\n\\n\"That leaves two to be answered.\"  \\n\\n\"I\\'m not sure about the priesthood, Domne.\"  \\n\\n\"Look, you\\'ll have to decide. You have less experience with  \\n\\nstarships than any of the others. None of the others is \\n\\nordained. Someone has to be partially released from \\n\\ntechnical duties for pastoral and administrative duties. I \\n\\ntold you this will not mean abandoning the Order. It won\\'t, \\n\\nbut your group will become an independent daughter \\n\\nhouse of the Order, under a modified rule. The Superior \\n\\nwill be elected by secret ballot of the professed, of course– \\n\\nand you are the most obvious candidate, if you have a \\n\\nvocation to the priesthood as well. Have you, or haven\\'t \\n\\nyou? There\\'s your inquisition, and the time\\'s now, and a \\n\\nbrief now it is too.\" \\n\\n\"But Reverend Father, I\\'m not through studying– \" \\n\\n\"That doesn\\'t matter. Besides the twenty-seven-man \\n\\ncrew– all our people-others are going too: six sisters and \\n\\ntwenty children from the Saint Joseph school, a couple of \\n\\nscientists, and three bishops, two of them newly \\n\\nconsecrated. They can ordain, and since one of the three is \\n\\na delegate of the Holy Father, they will even have the \\n\\npower to consecrate bishops. They can ordain you when \\n\\nthey feel you\\'re ready. You\\'ll be in space for years, you \\n\\nknow. But we want to know whether you have a vocation, \\n\\nand we want to know it now.\" \\n\\nBrother Joshua stammered for a moment, then shook his \\n\\nhead. \"I don\\'t know.\" \\n\\n\"Would you like half an hour? Would you like a glass of \\n\\nwater? You go so gray. I tell you, son, if you\\'re to lead the \\n\\nflock, you\\'ll have to be able to decide things here-and-now. \\n\\nYou need to now. Well, can you speak?\" \\n\\n\"Domne, I\\'m not– certain– \" \\n\\n\"You can croak anyhow, eh? Are you going to submit to \\n\\nthe yoke, son? Or aren\\'t you broken yet? You\\'ll be asked to \\n\\nbe the ass He rides into Jerusalem, but it\\'s a heavy load, \\n\\nand it\\'ll break your back, because He\\'s carrying the sins of \\n\\nthe world.\" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I\\'m able.\" \\n\\n\"Croak and wheeze. But you can growl too, and that\\'s well \\n\\nfor the leader of the pack. Listen, none of us has been \\n\\nreally able. But we\\'ve tried, and we\\'ve been tried. It tries \\n\\nyou to destruction, but you\\'re here for that. This Order has \\n\\nhad abbots of gold, abbots of cold tough steel, abbots of \\n\\ncorroded lead, and none of them was able, although some \\n\\nwere abler than others, some saints even. The gold got \\n\\nbattered, the steel got brittle and broke, and the corroded \\n\\nlead got stamped into ashes by Heaven. Me, I\\'ve been \\n\\nlucky enough to be quicksilver; I spatter, but I run back \\n\\ntogether somehow. I feel another spattering coming on, \\n\\nthough, Brother, and I think it\\'s for keeps this time. What \\n\\nare you made of, son? What\\'s to be tried?\" \\n\\n\"Puppy dog tails. I\\'m meat, and I\\'m scared, Reverend \\n\\nFather.\" \\n\\n\"Steel screams when it\\'s forged, it gasps when it\\'s \\n\\nquenched. It creaks when it goes under load. I think even \\n\\nsteel is scared, son. Take half an hour to think? A drink of \\n\\nwater? A drink of wine? Totter off awhile. If it makes you \\n\\nseasick, then prudently vomit. If it makes you terrified, \\n\\nscream. If it makes you anything, pray. But come into the \\n\\nchurch before Mass, and tell us what a monk is made of. \\n\\nThe Order is fissioning, and the part of us that goes into \\n\\nspace goes forever. Are you called to be its shepherd, or \\n\\nare you not? Go and decide.\" \\n\\n\"I guess there\\'s no way out.\" \\n\\n\"Of course there is. You have only to say, \\'I\\'m not called to \\n\\nit.\\' Then somebody else will be elected, that\\'s all. But go, \\n\\ncalm down, and then come to us in church with a yes or a \\n\\nno. That\\'s where I\\'m going now.\" The abbot arose and \\n\\nnodded a dismissal. \\n\\nThe darkness in the courtyard was nearly total. Only a thin \\n\\nsliver of light leaked from under the church doors. The \\n\\nfaint luminosity of starlight was blurred by a dust haze. No \\n\\nhint of dawn had appeared in the east. Brother Joshua \\n\\nwandered in silence. Finally he sat on a curbing that \\n\\nenclosed a bed of rose bushes. He put his chin in his hands \\n\\nand rolled a pebble around with his toe. The buildings of \\n\\nthe abbey were dark and sleeping shadows. A faint slice of \\n\\ncantaloupe moon hung low in the south. \\n\\nThe murmur of chanting came from the church: Excita, \\n\\nDomine, potentiam tuam, et veni, ut salvos--Stir up thy \\n\\nmight indeed, O Lord, and come to save us. That breath of \\n\\nprayer would go on and on, as long as there was breath to \\n\\nbreathe it. Even if the brethren thought it futile. \\n\\nBut they couldn\\'t know it to be futile. Or could they? If \\n\\nRome had any hope, why send the starship? Why, if they \\n\\nbelieved that prayers for peace on earth would ever be \\n\\nanswered? Was not the starship an act of despair? . . . \\n\\nRetrahe me, Satanas, et discede! he thought. The starship \\n\\nis an act of hope. Hope for Man elsewhere, peace \\n\\nsomewhere, if not here and now, then someplace: Alpha \\n\\nCentauri\\'s planet maybe, Beta Hydri, or one of the sickly \\n\\nstraggling colonies on that planet of What\\'s-its-name in \\n\\nScorpius. Hope, and not futility, is sending the ship, thou \\n\\nfoul Seductor. It is a weary and dog-tired hope, maybe, a \\n\\nhope that says: Shake the dust off your sandals and go \\n\\npreach Sodom to Gomorrha. But it is hope, or it wouldn\\'t \\n\\nsay go at all. It isn\\'t hope for Earth, but hope for the soul \\n\\nand substance of Man somewhere. With Lucifer hanging \\n\\nover, not sending the ship would be an act of presumption, \\n\\nof God, cast thyself down from the pinnacle. For angels will \\n\\nbear thee up. \\n\\nToo much hope for Earth had led men to try to make it \\n\\nEden, and of that they might well despair until the time \\n\\ntoward the consumption of the world– Someone had \\n\\nopened the abbey doors. Monks were leaving quietly for \\n\\ntheir cells. Only a dim glow spilled from the doorway into \\n\\nthe courtyard. The light was dim in the church. Joshua \\n\\ncould see only a few candles and the dim red eye of the \\n\\nsanctuary lamp. The twenty-six of his brethren were just \\n\\nvisible where they knelt, waiting. Someone closed the \\n\\ndoors again, but not quite for through a crack he could still \\n\\nsee the red dot of the sanctuary lamp. Fire kindled in \\n\\nworship, burning in praise, burning gently in adoration \\n\\nthere in its red receptacle. Fire, loveliest of the four \\n\\nelements of the world, and yet an element too in Hell. \\n\\nWhile it burned adoringly in the core of the Temple, it had \\n\\nalso scorched the life from a city, this night, and spewed \\n\\nits venom over the land. How strange of God to speak \\n\\nfrom a burning bush, and of Man to make a symbol of \\n\\nHeaven into a symbol of Hell. \\n\\nHe peered up again at the dusty stars of morning. Well, \\n\\nthere would be no Edens found out there, they said. Yet \\n\\nthere were men out there now, men who looked up to \\n\\nstrange suns in stranger skies, gasped strange air, tilled \\n\\nstrange earth. On worlds of frozen equatorial tundra, \\n\\nworlds of steaming Arctic jungle, a little like Earth perhaps, \\n\\nenough like Earth so that Man might live somehow, by the \\n\\nsame sweat of his brow. They were but a handful, these \\n\\ncelestial colonists of Homo loquax nonnumquam sapiens, a \\n\\nfew harassed colonies of humanity that had had small help \\n\\nfrom Earth thus far; and now they might expect no help at \\n\\nall, there in their new non-Edens, even less like Paradise \\n\\nthan Earth had been. Fortunately for them, perhaps. The \\n\\ncloser men came to perfecting for themselves a paradise, \\n\\nthe more impatient they seemed to become with it, and \\n\\nwith themselves as well. They made a garden of pleasure, \\n\\nand became progressively more miserable with it as it \\n\\ngrew in richness and power and beauty; for then, perhaps, \\n\\nit was easier for them to see that something was missing \\n\\nin the garden, some tree or shrub that would not grow. \\n\\nWhen the world was in darkness and wretchedness, it \\n\\ncould believe in perfection and yearn for it. But when the \\n\\nworld became bright with reason and riches, it began to \\n\\nsense the narrowness of the needle\\'s eye, and that rankled \\n\\nfor a world no longer willing to believe or yearn. Well, they \\n\\nwere going to destroy it again, were they?– this garden \\n\\nEarth, civilized and knowing, to be torn apart again that \\n\\nMan might hope again in wretched darkness. \\n\\nAnd yet the Memorabilia was to go with the ship! Was it a \\n\\ncurse? . . . Discede, Seductor informis! It was no curse, \\n\\nthis knowledge, unless perverted by Man, as fire had been, \\n\\nthis night. . . \\n\\nWhy do I have to leave, Lord? he wondered. Must I go? \\n\\nAnd what am I trying to decide: to go, or to refuse to go? \\n\\nBut that was already decided; there had been a summons \\n\\nto that– long ago. Egrediamur tellure, then, for it was \\n\\ncommanded by a vow I pledged. So I go. But to lay hands \\n\\non me and call me a priest, to call me abbas even, to set \\n\\nme to watch over the souls of my brethren? Must Reverend \\n\\nFather insist on that? But he isn\\'t insisting on that; he is \\n\\nonly insisting on knowing whether God insists on that. But \\n\\nhe is in such a terrible hurry. Is he really so sure of me as \\n\\nall that? To drop it on me this way, he must be more \\n\\ncertain of me than I am of myself. \\n\\nSpeak up, destiny, speak up! Destiny always seems \\n\\ndecades away, but suddenly it\\'s not decades away; it\\'s \\n\\nhere, right this very instant, maybe. \\n\\nIsn\\'t it enough that he\\'s sure of me? But no, that is not \\n\\nnearly enough. Got to be sure myself, somehow. In half an \\n\\nhour. Less than half, now. Audi me, Domine– please, Lord– \\n\\nIt\\'s only one of your vipers of this generation, begging for \\n\\nsomething, begging to know, begging a sign, a sign, a \\n\\nportent, an omen. I\\'ve not enough time to decide. \\n\\nHe started nervously. Something– slithering? \\n\\nHe heard it as a quiet rustling in the dry leaves under the \\n\\nrose bushes behind him. It stopped, rustled, and slithered \\n\\nagain. Would a sign from Heaven slither? An omen or a \\n\\nportent might. The Psalmist\\'s negotium perambulans in \\n\\ntenebris might. A sidewinder might. \\n\\nA cricket, perhaps. It was only rustling. Brother Hegan had \\n\\nkilled a sidewinder in the courtyard once, but . . . Now it \\n\\nslithered again!– a slow dragging in the leaves. Would it be \\n\\nan appropriate sign if it slithered out and stung him in the \\n\\nbackside? \\n\\nThe sound of prayer came from the church again: \\n\\nReminiscentur et convertentur ad Dominum universi fines \\n\\nterrae. Et adorabunt in conspectu universae familiae \\n\\ngentium. Quoniam Domini est regnum; et ipse \\n\\ndominabitur. . . . Strange words for tonight: All the ends of \\n\\nthe Earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord. . . \\n\\nReally, Lord, a sign isn\\'t absolutely essential. Really, I. . . \\n\\nSomething nudged at his wrist. He shot upward with a yelp \\n\\nand leaped away from the rose bushes. He seized a loose \\n\\nrock and threw it into the bushes. The crash was louder \\n\\nthan he had expected. He scratched at his beard and felt \\n\\nsheepish. He waited. Nothing emerged from the bushes. \\n\\nNothing slithered. He tossed a pebble. It too rattled \\n\\noffensively in the darkness. He waited, but nothing stirred \\n\\nin the bushes. Ask for an omen, then stone it when it \\n\\ncomes– de essentia hominum. \\n\\nA pink tongue of dawn was beginning to lick the stars from \\n\\nthe sky. Soon he would have to go tell the abbot. And tell \\n\\nhim what? \\n\\nBrother Joshua brushed gnats from his beard and started \\n\\ntoward the church, because someone had just come to the \\n\\ndoor and looked out– looking for him? \\n\\nUnus panis, et unum corpus multi sumus, came the \\n\\nmurmur from the church, omnes qui de uno. . . One bread \\n\\nand one body, though many, are we, and of one bread and \\n\\none chalice have partaken. . . \\n\\nHe paused in the doorway to look back toward the rose \\n\\nbushes. It was a trap, wasn\\'t it? he thought. You\\'d send it, \\n\\nknowing I\\'d throw stones at it, wouldn\\'t you? \\n\\nA moment later, he slipped inside and went to kneel with \\n\\nthe others. His voice joined theirs in the entreaty; for a \\n\\ntime he ceased to think, amid the company of monastic \\n\\nspacegoers assembled there. Annuntiabitur Domino \\n\\ngeneratio ventura . . . And there shall be declared to the \\n\\nLord a generation to come; and the heavens shall show \\n\\nforth His justice. To a people that shall be born, which the \\n\\nLord hath made. \\n\\nWhen he became aware again, he saw the abbot motioning \\n\\nto him. Brother Joshua went to kneel next to him. \\n\\n\"Hoc officium, Fili-tibine imponemus oneri?\" he whispered. \\n\\n\"If they want me,\" the monk answered softly, \"honorem \\n\\naccipiam.\" \\n\\nThe abbot smiled. \"You heard me badly. I said \\'burden,\\' \\n\\nnot \\'honor.\\' Crucis autem onus si audisti ut honorem, nihilo \\n\\nerrasti auribus.\" \\n\\n\"Accipiam,\" the monk repeated. \\n\\n\"You\\'re certain?\" \\n\\n\"If they choose me, I shall be certain.\" \\n\\n\"Well enough.\" \\n\\nThus it was settled. While the sun rose, a shepherd was \\n\\nelected to lead the flock. \\n\\nAfterward, the conventual Mass was a Mass for Pilgrims \\n\\nand Travelers. \\n\\nIt had not been easy to charter a plane for the flight to \\n\\nNew Rome. Even harder was the task of winning clearance \\n\\nfor the flight after the plane had been chartered. All civil \\n\\naircraft had come under the jurisdiction of the military for \\n\\nthe duration of the emergency, and a military clearance \\n\\nwas required. It had been refused by the local ZDI. If \\n\\nAbbot Zerchi had not been aware of the fact that a certain \\n\\nair marshal and a certain cardinal archbishop happened to \\n\\nbe friends, the ostensible pilgrimage to New Rome by \\n\\nproceeded on shank\\'s mare, for lack of permission to use \\n\\nrapid transport jet. By midafternoon, however, clearance \\n\\nhad been granted. Abbot Zerchi boarded the plane briefly \\n\\nbefore takeoff– for last farewells. \\n\\n\"You are the continuity of the Order,\" he told them. \"With \\n\\nyou goes the Memorabilia. With you also goes the apostolic \\n\\nsuccession, and, perhaps– the Chair of Peter. \\n\\n\"No, no,\" he added in response to the murmur of surprise \\n\\nfrom the monks. \"Not His Holiness. I had not told you this \\n\\nbefore, but if the worst comes on Earth, the College of \\n\\nCardinals– or what\\'s left of it– will convene. The \\n\\nCentaurus Colony may then be declared a separate \\n\\npatriarchate, with full patriarchal jurisdiction going to the \\n\\ncardinal who will accompany you. If the scourge falls on us \\n\\nhere, to him, then, will go the Patrimony of Peter. For \\n\\nthough life on Earth may be destroyed– God forbid– as \\n\\nlong as Man lives elsewhere, the office of Peter cannot be \\n\\ndestroyed. There are many who think that if the curse falls \\n\\non Earth, the papacy would pass to him by the principle of \\n\\nEpikeia if there were no survivors here. But that is not \\n\\nyour direct concern, brothers, sons, although you will be \\n\\nsubject to your patriarch under special vows as those \\n\\nwhich bind the Jesuits to the Pope. \\n\\n\"You will be years in space. The ship will be your \\n\\nmonastery. After the patriarchal see is established at the \\n\\nCentaurus Colony, you will establish there a mother house \\n\\nof the Visitationist Friars of the Order of Saint Leibowitz of \\n\\nTycho. But the ship will remain in your hands, and the \\n\\nMemorabilia. If civilization, or a vestige of it, can maintain \\n\\nitself on Centaurus, you will send missions to the other \\n\\ncolony worlds, and perhaps eventually to the colonies of \\n\\ntheir colonies. Wherever Man goes, you and your \\n\\nsuccessors will go. And with you, the records and \\n\\nremembrances of four thousand years and more. Some of \\n\\nyou, or those to come after you, will be mendicants and \\n\\nwanderers, teaching the chronicles of Earth and the \\n\\ncanticles of the Crucified to the peoples and the cultures \\n\\nthat may grow out of the colony groups. For some may \\n\\nforget. Some may be lost for a time from the Faith. Teach \\n\\nthem, and receive into the Order those among them who \\n\\nare called. Pass on to them the continuity. Be for Man the \\n\\nmemory of Earth and Origin. Remember this Earth. Never \\n\\nforget her, but– never come back.\" Zerchi\\'s voice went \\n\\nhoarse and low. \"If you ever come back, you might meet \\n\\nthe Archangel at the east end of Earth, guarding her \\n\\npasses with a sword of flame. I feel it. Space is your home \\n\\nhereafter. It\\'s a lonelier desert than ours. God bless you, \\n\\nand pray for us.\" \\n\\nHe moved slowly down the aisle, pausing at each seat to \\n\\nbless and embrace before he left the plane. The plane \\n\\nit disappeared from view in the evening sky. Afterward, he \\n\\ndrove back to the abbey and to the remainder of his flock. \\n\\nWhile aboard the plane, he had spoken as if the destiny of \\n\\nBrother Joshua\\'s group were as clearcut as the prayers \\n\\nknew that he had only been reading the palm of a plan, \\n\\nhad been describing a hope and not a certainty. For \\n\\nBrother Joshua\\'s group had only begun the first short lap \\n\\nof a long and doubtful journey, a new Exodus from Egypt \\n\\nunder the auspices of a God who must surely be very \\n\\nweary of the race of Man. \\n\\nThose who stayed behind had the easier part. Theirs was \\n\\nbut to wait for the end and pray that it would not come. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Twenty-seven  \\n\\n\"The area affected by local fallout remains relatively \\n\\nstationary,\" said the announcer, \"and the danger of further \\n\\nwindspread has nearly vanished. . . .\" \\n\\n\"Well, at least nothing worse had happened yet,\" remarked \\n\\nthe abbot\\'s guest. \"So far, we\\'ve been safe from it here. It \\n\\nlooks like we\\'ll stay safe, unless the conference falls \\n\\napart.\" \\n\\n\"Will we now,\" Zerchi grunted. \"But listen a moment.\" \\n\\n\"The latest death toll estimate,\" the announcer continued, \\n\\n\"on this ninth day after the destruction of the capital, gives \\n\\ntwo million, eight hundred thousand dead. More than half \\n\\nof this figure is from the population of the city proper. The \\n\\nrest is an estimate based on the percentage of the \\n\\npopulation in the fringe and fallout areas known to have \\n\\nreceived critical doses of radiation. Experts predict that the \\n\\nestimate will rise as more radiation cases are reported. \\n\\n\"This station is required by law to broadcast the following \\n\\nannouncement twice daily for the duration of the \\n\\nemergency: \\'The provisions of Public Law 10-WR-3E in no \\n\\nway empower private citizens to administer euthanasia to \\n\\nvictims of radiation poisoning. Victims who have been \\n\\nexposed, or who think they have been exposed, to \\n\\nradiation far in excess of the critical dosage must report to \\n\\nthe nearest Green Star Relief Station, where a magistrate \\n\\nis empowered to issue a writ of Mori Vult to anyone \\n\\nproperly certified as a hopeless case, if the sufferer desires \\n\\neuthanasia. Any victim of radiation who takes his own life \\n\\nin any manner other than that prescribed by law will be \\n\\nconsidered a suicide, and will jeopardize the right of his \\n\\nheirs and dependents to claim insurance and other \\n\\nradiation relief benefits under the law. Moreover, any \\n\\ncitizen who assists such a suicide may be prosecuted for \\n\\nmurder. The Radiation Disaster Act authorizes euthanasia \\n\\nonly after due process of law. Serious cases of radiation \\n\\nsickness must report to a Green Star Relief– \" \\n\\nAbruptly, and with such force that he twisted the dial-knob \\n\\nfree of its shaft, Zerchi switched off the receiver. He swung \\n\\nhimself out of his chair and went to stand at the window \\n\\nand look down on the courtyard where a crowd of refugees \\n\\nwere milling around several hastily built wooden tables. \\n\\nThe abbey, old and new, was overrun by people of all ages \\n\\nand stations whose homes had been in the blighted \\n\\nregions. The abbot had temporarily readjusted the \\n\\n\"cloistered\" areas of the abbey to give the refugees access \\n\\nto virtually everything except the monks\\' sleeping \\n\\nquarters. The sign outside the old gate had been removed, \\n\\ngiven shelter. \\n\\nHe watched two novices carrying a steaming cauldron out \\n\\nof the emergency kitchen. They hoisted it onto a table and \\n\\nbegan ladling out soup. \\n\\nThe abbot\\'s visitor cleared his throat and stirred restlessly \\n\\nin his chair. The abbot turned. \\n\\n\"Due process, they call it,\" he growled. \"Due process of \\n\\nmass, state-sponsored suicide. With all of society\\'s \\n\\nblessings.\" \\n\\n\"Well,\" said the visitor, \"it\\'s certainly better than letting \\n\\nthem die horribly, by degrees.\" \\n\\n\"Is it? Better for whom? The street cleaners? Better to \\n\\nhave your living corpses walk to a central disposal station \\n\\nwhile they can still walk? Less public spectacle? Less horror \\n\\nlying around? Less disorder? A few million corpses lying \\n\\naround might start a rebellion against those responsible. \\n\\nThat\\'s what you and the government mean by better, isn\\'t \\n\\nit?\" \\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t know about the government,\" said the visitor, \\n\\nwith only a trace of stiffness in his voice. \"What I meant by \\n\\nbetter was \\'more merciful.\\' I have no intention of arguing \\n\\nyour moral theology with you. If you think you have a soul \\n\\nthat God would send to Hell if you chose to die painlessly \\n\\ninstead of horribly, then go ahead and think so. But you\\'re \\n\\nin a minority, you know. I disagree, but there\\'s nothing to \\n\\nargue about.\" \\n\\n\"Forgive me,\" said Abbot Zerchi. \"I wasn\\'t getting ready to \\n\\nargue moral theology with you. I was speaking only of this \\n\\nspectacle of mass euthanasia in terms of human \\n\\nmotivation. The very existence of the Radiation Disaster \\n\\nAct, and like laws in other countries, is the plainest \\n\\npossible evidence that governments were fully aware of \\n\\nthe consequences of another war, but instead of trying to \\n\\nmake the crime impossible, they tried to provide in \\n\\nadvance for the consequences of the crime. Are the \\n\\nimplications of that fact meaningless to you, Doctor?\" \\n\\n\"Of course not, Father. Personally, I am a pacifist. But for \\n\\nthe present we\\'re stuck with the world as it is. And if they \\n\\ncouldn\\'t agree on a way to make an act of war impossible,  \\n\\nthen it is better to have some provisions for coping with \\n\\nthe consequences than to have no provisions.\" \\n\\n\"Yes and no. Yes, if it\\'s in anticipation of somebody else\\'s \\n\\ncrime. No, if it\\'s in anticipation of one\\'s own. And especially \\n\\nno if the provision to soften the consequences are criminal \\n\\ntoo.\" \\n\\nThe visitor shrugged. \"Like euthanasia? I\\'m sorry, Father, I \\n\\nfeel that the laws of society are what makes something a \\n\\ncrime or not a crime. I\\'m aware that you don\\'t agree. And \\n\\nthere can be bad laws, ill-conceived, true. But in this case, \\n\\nI think we have a good law. If I thought I had such a thing \\n\\nas a soul, and that there was an angry God in Heaven, I \\n\\nmight agree with you.\" \\n\\nAbbot Zerchi smiled thinly. \"You don\\'t have a soul, Doctor. \\n\\nYou are a soul. You have a body, temporarily.\" \\n\\nThe visitor laughed politely. \"A semantic confusion.\" \\n\\n\"True. But which of us is confused? Are you sure?\" \\n\\n\"Let\\'s not quarrel, Father. I\\'m not with the Mercy Cadre. I \\n\\nwork on the Exposure Survey Team. We don\\'t kill \\n\\nanybody.\" \\n\\nAbbot Zerchi gazed at him in silence for a moment. The \\n\\nvisitor was a short muscular man with a pleasant round \\n\\nHe wore a green serge uniform, and a cap with the Green \\n\\nStar insignia lay in his lap. \\n\\nWhy quarrel, indeed? The man was a medical worker, not \\n\\nan executioner. Some of the Green Star\\'s relief work was \\n\\nadmirable. Occasionally it was even heroic. That in some \\n\\ninstances it wrought evil, according to Zerchi\\'s belief, was \\n\\nno reason to regard its good works as tainted. The bulk of \\n\\nsociety favored it, and its workers were in good faith. The \\n\\ndoctor had tried to be friendly. His request had seemed \\n\\nsimple enough. He had been neither demanding nor \\n\\nofficious about it. Still, the abbot hesitated before saying \\n\\nyes. \\n\\n\"The work you want to do here– will it take long?\" \\n\\nThe doctor shook his head. \"Two days at most, I think. We \\n\\nhave two mobile units. We can bring them into your \\n\\ncourtyard, hitch the two trailers together, and start right to \\n\\nwounded, first. We treat only the most urgent cases. Our \\n\\njob is clinical testing. The sick ones will get treatment at an \\n\\nemergency camp.\" \\n\\n\"And the sickest ones get something else at a mercy \\n\\ncamp?\" \\n\\nThe worker frowned. \"Only if they want to go. Nobody \\n\\nmakes them go.\" \\n\\n\"But you write out the permit that lets them go.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ve given some red tickets, yes. I may have to this time. \\n\\nHere– \" He fumbled in his jacket pocket and brought out a \\n\\nred cardboard form, something like a shipping label with a \\n\\nloop of wire for attaching it to a buttonhole or a belt loop. \\n\\nHe tossed it on the desk. \"A blank \\'crit-dose\\' form. There it \\n\\nis. Read it. It tells the man he\\'s sick, very sick. And here– \\n\\nhere\\'s a green ticket too. It tells him he\\'s well and has \\n\\nnothing to worry about. Look at the red one carefully! \\n\\n\\'Estimated exposure in radiation units.\\' \\'Blood count.\\' \\n\\n\\'Urinalysis.\\' On one side, it\\'s just like the green one. On \\n\\nthe other side, the green one\\'s blank, but look at the back \\n\\nof the red one. The fine print– it\\'s directly quoted from \\n\\nPublic Law 10-WR-3E. It has to be there. The law requires \\n\\nit. It has to be read to him. He has to be told his rights. \\n\\nWhat he does about it is his own affair. Now, if you\\'d \\n\\nrather we parked the mobile units down the highway, we \\n\\ncan– \" \\n\\n\"You just read it to him, do you? Nothing else?\" \\n\\nThe doctor paused. \"It has to be explained to him, if he \\n\\ndoesn\\'t understand it.\" He paused again, gathering \\n\\nirritation. \"Good Lord, Father, when you tell a man he\\'s a \\n\\nhopeless case, what are you going to say? Read him a few \\n\\nparagraphs of the law, show him the door, and say: \\'Next, \\n\\nplease!\\'? \\'You\\'re going to die, so good day\\'? Of course you \\n\\ndon\\'t read him that and nothing else, not if you have any \\n\\nhuman feeling at all!\" \\n\\n\"I understand that. What I want to know is something else. \\n\\nDo you, as a physician, advise hopeless cases to go to a \\n\\nmercy camp?\" \\n\\n\"I– \" The medic stopped and closed his eyes. He rested his \\n\\nforehead on his hand. He shuddered slightly. \"Of course I \\n\\ndo,\" he said finally. \"If you\\'d seen what I\\'ve seen, you \\n\\nwould too. Of course I do.\" \\n\\n\"You\\'ll not do it here.\"  \\n\\n\"Then we\\'ll– \" The doctor quenched an angry outburst. He \\n\\nstood up, started to put on his cap, then paused. He \\n\\ntossed the cap on the chair and walked over to the \\n\\nwindow. He looked gloomily down at the courtyard, then \\n\\nout at the highway. He pointed. \"There\\'s the roadside \\n\\npark. We can set up shop there. But it\\'s two miles. Most of \\n\\nthem will have to walk.\" He glanced at Abbot Zerchi, then \\n\\nlooked broodingly down into the courtyard again. \"Look at \\n\\nthem. They\\'re sick, hurt, fractured, frightened. The \\n\\nchildren too. Tired, lame, and miserable. You\\'d let them be \\n\\nherded off down the highway to sit in the dust and the sun \\n\\nand– \" \\n\\n\"I don\\'t want it to be that way,\" said the abbot. \"Look– you \\n\\nwere just telling me how a man-made law made it \\n\\nmandatory for you to read and explain this to a critical \\n\\nradiation case. I offered no objection to that in itself. \\n\\nRender unto Caesar to that extent, since the law demands \\n\\nit of you. Can you not, then, understand that I am subject \\n\\nto another law, and that it forbids me to allow you or \\n\\nanyone else on this property, under my rule, to counsel \\n\\nanyone to do what the Church calls evil?\" \\n\\n\"Oh, I understand well enough.\"  \\n\\n\"Very well. You need only make me one promise, and you \\n\\nmay use the courtyard.\" \\n\\n\"What promise?\" \\n\\n\"Simply that you won\\'t advise anyone to go to a \\'mercy \\n\\ncamp.\\' Limit yourself to diagnosis. If you find hopeless \\n\\nradiation cases, tell them what the law forces you to tell \\n\\nthem, be as consoling as you wish, but don\\'t tell them to \\n\\ngo kill themselves.\" \\n\\nThe doctor hesitated. \"I think it would be proper to make \\n\\nsuch a promise with respect to patients who belong to your \\n\\nFaith.\" \\n\\nAbbot Zerchi lowered his eyes. \"I\\'m sorry,\" he said finally, \\n\\n\"but that\\'s not enough.\" \\n\\n\"Why? Others are not bound by your principles. If a man is \\n\\nnot of your religion, why should you refuse to allow– \" He \\n\\nchoked off angrily. \\n\\n\"Do you want an explanation?\"  \\n\\n\"Yes.\"  \\n\\n\"Because if a man is ignorant of the fact that something is \\n\\nwrong, and acts in ignorance, he incurs no guilt, provided \\n\\nnatural reason was not enough to show him that it was \\n\\nwrong. But while ignorance may excuse the man, it does \\n\\nnot excuse the act, which is wrong in itself. If I permitted \\n\\nthe act simply because the man is ignorant that it is \\n\\nwrong, then I would incur guilt, because I do know it to be \\n\\nwrong. It is really that painfully simple.\" \\n\\n\"Listen, Father. They sit there and they look at you. Some \\n\\nscream. Some cry. Some just sit there. All of them say, \\n\\n\\'Doctor, what can I do?\\' And what am I supposed to \\n\\nanswer? Say nothing? Say, \\'You can die, that\\'s all.\\' What \\n\\nwould you say?\" \\n\\n\"\\'Pray.\\'\" \\n\\n\"Yes, you would, wouldn\\'t you? Listen, pain is the only evil \\n\\nI know about. It\\'s the only one I can fight.\" \\n\\n\"Then God help you.\" \\n\\n\"Antibiotics help me more.\" \\n\\nAbbot Zerchi groped for a sharp reply, found one, but \\n\\nswiftly swallowed it. He searched for a blank piece of paper \\n\\nand a pen and pushed them across the desk. \"Just write: \\'I \\n\\nabbey,\\' and sign it. Then you can use the courtyard.\" \\n\\n\"And if I refuse?\" \\n\\n\"Then I suppose they\\'ll have to drag themselves two miles \\n\\ndown the road.\" \\n\\n\"Of all the merciless– \" \\n\\n\"On the contrary. I\\'ve offered you an opportunity to do \\n\\nyour work as required by the law you recognize, without \\n\\noverstepping the law I recognize. Whether they go down \\n\\nthe road or not is up to you.\" \\n\\nThe doctor stared at the blank page. \"What is so magic \\n\\nabout putting it in writing?\" \\n\\n\"I prefer it that way.\" \\n\\nHe bent silently over the desk and wrote. He looked at \\n\\nwhat he had written, then slashed his signature under it \\n\\nand straightened. \"All right, there\\'s your promise. Do you \\n\\nthink it\\'s worth any more than my spoken word?\" \\n\\n\"No. No indeed.\" The abbot folded the note and tucked it \\n\\ninto his coat. \"But it\\'s here in my pocket, and you know it\\'s \\n\\nhere in my pocket, and I can look at it occasionally, that\\'s \\n\\nall. Do you keep promises, by the way, Doctor Cors?\" \\n\\nThe medic stared at him for a moment. \"I\\'ll keep it.\" He \\n\\ngrunted, then turned on his heel and stalked out. \\n\\n\"Brother Pat!\" Abbot Zerchi called weakly. \"Brother Pat, \\n\\nare you there?\" \\n\\nHis secretary came to stand in the doorway. \"Yes, \\n\\nReverend Father?\" \\n\\n\"You heard?\" \\n\\n\"I heard some of it. The door was open, and I couldn\\'t help \\n\\nhearing. You didn\\'t have the silencer– \" \\n\\n\"You heard him say it? \\'Pain\\'s the only evil I know about.\\' \\n\\nYou heard that?\" \\n\\nThe monk nodded solemnly. \\n\\n\"And that society is the only thing which determines \\n\\nwhether an act is wrong or not? That too?\" \\n\\n\"Yes.\" \\n\\n\"Dearest God, how did those two heresies get back into \\n\\nthe world after all this time? Hell has limited imaginations \\n\\ndown there. \\'The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.\\' \\n\\nBrother Pat, you\\'d better get out of here, or I\\'ll start \\n\\nraving.\" \\n\\n\"Domne, I– \" \\n\\n\"What\\'s keeping you? What\\'s that, a letter? All right, give it \\n\\nhere.\" \\n\\nThe monk handed it to him and went out. Zerchi left it \\n\\nunopened and glanced at the doctor\\'s pledge again. \\n\\nWorthless, perhaps. But still the man was sincere. And \\n\\ndedicated. He\\'d have to be dedicated to work for the kind \\n\\nof salary the Green Star paid. He had looked underslept \\n\\nand overworked. He\\'d probably been living on benzedrine \\n\\nand doughnuts since the shot that killed the city. Seeing \\n\\nmisery everywhere and detesting it, and sincere in wanting \\n\\nto do something about it. Sincere– that was the hell of it. \\n\\nFrom a distance, one\\'s adversaries seemed fiends, but with \\n\\na closer view, one saw the sincerity, and it was as great as \\n\\none\\'s own. Perhaps Satan was the sincerest of the lot. \\n\\nHe opened the letter and read it. The letter informed him \\n\\nthat Brother Joshua and the others had departed from New \\n\\nRome for an unspecified destination in the West. The letter \\n\\nalso advised him that information about Quo peregrinatur \\n\\nhad leaked to the ZDI, who had sent investigators to the \\n\\nVatican to ask questions about the rumored launching of \\n\\nan unauthorized starship. . . Evidently the starship was not \\n\\nyet in space. \\n\\nThey\\'d learn soon enough about Quo peregrinatur, but \\n\\nwith the help of Heaven, they\\'d find out too late. What \\n\\nthen? he wondered. \\n\\nThe legal situation was tangled. The law forbade starship \\n\\ndepartures without commission approval. Approval was \\n\\nhard to get and slow in coming. Zerchi was certain that the \\n\\nZDI and the commission would consider the Church was \\n\\nbreaking the law. But a State-Church concordat had \\n\\nexisted for a century and a half now; it clearly exempted \\n\\nthe Church the right to send missions to \"whatever space \\n\\ninstallations and/or planetary outposts shall not have been \\n\\ndeclared by the aforesaid Commission to be ecologically \\n\\ncritical or closed to unregulated enterprise.\" Every \\n\\ninstallation in the solar system was \"ecologically critical\" \\n\\nand \"closed\" at the time of the concordat, but the \\n\\nconcordat further asserted the Church\\'s right to \"own \\n\\nspace vessels and travel unrestricted to open installations \\n\\nor outposts.\" The concordat was very old. It had been \\n\\nsigned in the days when the Berkstrun starship drive was \\n\\nonly a dream in the wide imagination of some who thought \\n\\nthat interstellar travel would open up the universe to an \\n\\nunrestricted outflow of population. \\n\\nThings had turned out otherwise. When the first starship \\n\\nwas born as an engineering drawing, it became plain that \\n\\nno institution except government had the means or the \\n\\nfunds to build them; that no profit was to be derived from \\n\\ntransporting colonies to extrasolar planets for purposes of \\n\\nhad sent the first colony ship. Then in the West the cry \\n\\nwas heard: \"Are we to let the \\'inferior\\' races inherit the \\n\\nstars?\" There had been a brief flurry of starship launchings \\n\\nas colonies of black people, brown, white, and yellow \\n\\npeople were hurled into the sky toward the Centaur, in the \\n\\nname of racism. Afterwards, geneticists had wryly \\n\\ndemonstrated that– since each racial group was so small \\n\\nthat unless their descendents intermarried, each would \\n\\nundergo deteriorative genetic drift due to inbreeding on \\n\\nthe colony planet– the racists had made crossbreeding \\n\\nnecessary to survival. \\n\\nThe only interest the Church had taken in space had been \\n\\nconcern for the colonists who were sons of the Church, cut \\n\\noff from the flock by interstellar distances. And yet she had \\n\\nnot taken advantage of that provision of the concordat \\n\\nwhich permitted the sending of missions. Certain \\n\\ncontradictions existed between the concordat and the laws \\n\\nof the State which empowered the commission, at least as \\n\\nthe latter law might in theory affect the sending of \\n\\nmissions. The contradiction had never been adjudicated by \\n\\nBut now, if the ZDI intercepted Brother Joshua\\'s group in \\n\\nthe act of launching a starship without a commission \\n\\npermit or charter, there would be cause. Zerchi prayed \\n\\nthat the group would get away without a test in the courts, \\n\\nwhich might take weeks or months. Of course there would \\n\\nbe a scandal afterwards. Many would charge not only that \\n\\nthe Church had violated Commission rulings but charity \\n\\ntoo, by sending ecclesiastical dignitaries and a bunch of \\n\\nrascal monks, when she might have used the ship as \\n\\nrefuge for poor colonists, hungry for land. The conflict of \\n\\nMartha and Mary always recurred. \\n\\nAbbot Zerchi suddenly realized that the tenor of his \\n\\nthinking had changed during the previous day or two. A \\n\\nfew days ago, everyone had been waiting for the sky to \\n\\nburst asunder. But nine days had passed since Lucifer had \\n\\nprevailed in space and scorched a city out of existence. \\n\\nDespite the dead, the maimed, and the dying, there had \\n\\nbeen nine days of silence. Since the wrath had been stayed \\n\\nthus far, perhaps the worst could be averted. He had found \\n\\nhimself thinking of things that might happen next week or \\n\\nnext month, as if– after all– there might really be a next \\n\\nweek or a next month. And why not? Examining \\n\\nconscience, he found that he had not altogether \\n\\nabandoned the virtue of hope. \\n\\nA monk returned from an errand in the city that afternoon \\n\\nand reported that a camp for refugees was being set up at \\n\\nthe park two miles down the highway. \"I think it\\'s being \\n\\nsponsored by Green Star, Domne,\" he added. \\n\\nhad to turn three truckloads of them away.\" \\n\\nThe refugees were noisy in the courtyard, and the noise \\n\\njangled overwrought nerves. The perpetual quiet of the old \\n\\nabbey was shattered by strange sounds: the boisterous \\n\\nlaughter of men telling jokes, the cry of a child, the rattle \\n\\nof pots and pans, hysterical sobbing, a Green Star medic \\n\\nshouting: \"Hey, Raff, go fetch an enema hose.\" Several \\n\\ntimes the abbot suppressed an urge to go to the window \\n\\nand call to them for silence. \\n\\nAfter bearing it as long as he could, he picked up a pair of \\n\\nbinoculars, an old book, and a rosary, and went up to one \\n\\nof the old watchtowers where a thick stone wall cut off \\n\\nmost of the sounds from the courtyard. The book was a \\n\\nslim volume of verse, really anonymous, but by legend \\n\\nascribed to a mythical saint, whose \"canonization\" was \\n\\naccomplished only in fable and the folklore of the Plains, \\n\\nand not by any act of the Holy See. No one, indeed, had \\n\\never found evidence that such a person as Saint Poet of \\n\\nthe Miraculous Eyeball had ever lived: the fable had \\n\\nprobably arisen out of the story that one of the early \\n\\nHannegans had been given a glass eyeball by a brilliant \\n\\nphysical theorist who was his protégé– Zerchi could not \\n\\nremember whether the scientist had been Esser Shon or  \\n\\nPfardentrott– and who told the prince that it had belonged \\n\\nto a poet who had died for the Faith. He had not specified \\n\\nwhich faith the poet had died for– that of Peter or that of \\n\\nthe Texarkanan schismatics– but evidently the Hannegan \\n\\nhad valued it, for he had mounted the eyeball in the clutch \\n\\nof a small golden hand which was still worn upon certain \\n\\nstate occasions by princes of the Harq-Hannegan dynasty. \\n\\nIt was variously called the Orbis Judicans Conscientiae or \\n\\nthe Oculus Poetae Judicis, and the remnants of the \\n\\nTexarkana Schism still revered it as a relic. Someone a few \\n\\nyears back had proposed the rather silly hypothesis that \\n\\nSaint Poet was the same person as the \"scurrilous \\n\\nversificator\" once mentioned in the Journals of the \\n\\nVenerable Abbot Jerome, but the only substantiating \\n\\n\"evidence\" for this notion was that Pfardentrott– or was it \\n\\nEsser Shon?– had visited the abbey during the reign of \\n\\nVenerable Jerome at about the same date as the \\n\\n\"scurrilous versificator\" entry in the Journal, and that the \\n\\ngift of the eyeball to Hannegan had occurred at some date \\n\\nafter that visit to the abbey. Zerchi suspected that the thin \\n\\nbook of verse had been penned by one of the secular \\n\\nscientists who had visited the abbey to study the \\n\\nMemorabilia at about that time, and that one of them could \\n\\nprobably be identified with the \"scurrilous versificator\" and \\n\\npossibly with the Saint Poet of folklore and fable. The  \\n\\nto have been written by a monk of the Order. \\n\\nThe book was a satirical dialogue in verse between two \\n\\nagnostics who were attempting to establish by natural \\n\\nreason alone that the existence of God could not be \\n\\nestablished by natural reason alone. They managed only to \\n\\ndemonstrate that the mathematical limit of an infinite \\n\\nsequence of \"doubting the certainty with which something \\n\\ndoubted is known to be unknowable when the \\'something \\n\\ndoubted\\' is still a preceding statement of \\'unknowability\\' of \\n\\nsomething doubted,\" that the limit of this process at \\n\\ninfinity can only be equivalent to a statement of absolute \\n\\ncertainty, even though phrased as an infinite series of \\n\\nnegations of certainty. The text bore traces of St. Leslie\\'s \\n\\ntheological calculus, and even as a poetic dialogue \\n\\nbetween an agnostic identified only as \"poet\" and another \\n\\nonly as \"Thon,\" it seemed to suggest a proof of the \\n\\nexistence of God by an epistemological method, but the \\n\\nversifier had been a satirist; neither poet nor don \\n\\nrelinquished his agnostic premises after the conclusion of \\n\\nabsolute certainty had been reached, but concluded \\n\\ninstead that: Non cogitamus, ergo nihil sumus. \\n\\nAbbot Zerchi soon tired of trying to decide whether the  \\n\\nbook was high intellectual comedy or more epigrammatic \\n\\nbuffoonery. From the tower, he could see the highway and \\n\\nthe city as far as the mesa beyond. He focused the \\n\\nbinoculars on the mesa and watched the radar installation \\n\\nfor a time, but nothing unusual appeared to be happening \\n\\nthere. He lowered the glasses slightly to watch the new \\n\\nGreen Star encampment down at the roadside park. The \\n\\narea of the park had been roped off. Tents were being \\n\\npitched. Utility crews worked at tapping the gas and power \\n\\nlines. Several men were engaged in hoisting a sign at the \\n\\nentrance to the park, but they held it edgewise to his gaze \\n\\nand he could not read it. Somehow the boiling activity \\n\\nreminded him of a nomad \"carnival\" coming to town. There \\n\\nwas a big red engine of some sort. It seemed to have a \\n\\nfirebox and something like a boiler, but he could not at \\n\\nfirst guess its purpose. Men in Green Star uniforms were \\n\\nerecting something that looked like a small carousel. At \\n\\nleast a dozen trucks were parked on the side road. Some \\n\\nwere loaded with lumber, others with tents and collapsible \\n\\ncots. One seemed to be hauling firebricks, and another \\n\\nwas burdened with pottery and straw. \\n\\nPottery? \\n\\nHe studied the last truck\\'s cargo carefully. A slight frown  \\n\\ngathered on his forehead. It was a load of urns or vases, \\n\\nall alike, and packed together with cushioning wads of \\n\\nstraw. Somewhere, he had seen the like of them, but could \\n\\nnot remember where. \\n\\nStill another truck carried nothing but a great \"stone\" \\n\\nstatue– probably made of reinforced plastic– and a square \\n\\nslab upon which the statue was evidently to be mounted. \\n\\nThe statue lay on its back, supported by a wooden \\n\\nframework and a nest of packing material. He could see \\n\\nonly its legs and one outstretched hand that thrust up \\n\\nthrough the packing straw. The statue was longer than the \\n\\nbed of the truck; its bare feet projected beyond tailgate. \\n\\nSomeone had tied a red flag to one of its great toes. Zerchi \\n\\npuzzled over it. Why waste a truck on a statue, when there \\n\\nwas probable need of another truckload of food? \\n\\nHe watched the men who were erecting the sign. At last \\n\\none of them lowered his end of the board and climbed a \\n\\nladder to perform some adjustment of the overhead \\n\\nbrackets. With one end resting on the ground, the sign \\n\\ntilted, and Zerchi, by craning, managed to read its \\n\\nmessage: \\n\\nMERCY CAMP NUMBER 18 \\n\\n GREEN STAR\\n\\n DISASTER CADRE PROJECT \\n\\nHurriedly, he looked again at the trucks. The pottery! \\n\\nRecognition came to him. Once he had driven past a \\n\\ncrematorium and seen men unloading the same sort of \\n\\nurns from a truck with the same company markings. He \\n\\nswung the binoculars again, searching for the truck loaded \\n\\nwith firebrick. The truck had moved. At last he located it, \\n\\nnow parked inside the area. The bricks were being \\n\\nunloaded near the great red engine. He inspected the \\n\\nengine again. What had at first glance appeared to be a \\n\\nboiler, now suggested an oven or a furnace. \"Evenit \\n\\ndiabolus!\" the abbot growled, and started for the wall \\n\\nstairs. \\n\\nHe found Doctor Cors in the mobile unit in the courtyard. \\n\\nThe doctor was wiring a yellow ticket to the lapel of an old \\n\\nman\\'s jacket, while telling him that he should go to a rest \\n\\ncamp for a while and mind the nurses, but that he\\'d be all \\n\\nright if he took care of himself.  \\n\\nZerchi stood with folded arms, munching at the edge of his \\n\\nlips and coldly watching the physician. When the old man \\n\\nwas gone, Cors looked up warily. \\n\\n\"Yes?\" His eyes took note of the binoculars and \\n\\nre-examined Zerchi\\'s face. \"Oh,\" he grunted. \"Well, I have \\n\\nnothing to do with that end of it, nothing at all.\" \\n\\nThe abbot gazed at him for a few seconds, then turned and \\n\\nstalked out. He went to his office and had Brother Patrick \\n\\ncall the highest Green Star official. . . \\n\\n\"I want it moved out of our vicinity.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid the answer is emphatically no.\". \\n\\n\"Brother Pat, call the workshop and get Brother Lufter up \\n\\nhere.\" \\n\\n\"He\\'s not there, Domne.\" \\n\\n\"Then have them send me a carpenter and a painter. \\n\\nAnybody will do.\" \\n\\nMinutes later, two monks arrived. \\n\\n\"I want five lightweight signs made at once,\" he told them. \\n\\n\"I want them with good long handles. They\\'re to be big \\n\\nenough to be read from a block away, but light enough for \\n\\na man to carry for several hours without getting dog-tired. \\n\\nCan you do that?\" \\n\\n\"Surely, m\\'Lord. What do you want them to say?\" \\n\\nAbbot Zerchi wrote it for them. \"Make it big and make it \\n\\nall.\" \\n\\nWhen they were gone, he called Brother Patrick again. \\n\\n\"Brother Pat, go find me five good, young, healthy novices, \\n\\npreferably with martyr complexes. Tell them they may get \\n\\nwhat Saint Stephen got.\" \\n\\nAnd I may get even worse, he thought, when New Rome \\n\\nhears about it. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Twenty-eight  \\n\\nCompline had been sung, but the abbot stayed on in the \\n\\nchurch, kneeling alone in the gloom of evening. \\n\\nDomine, mundorum omnium Factor, parsurus esto \\n\\nimprimis eis filiis aviantibus ad sideria caeli quorum victus \\n\\ndificilior. . . \\n\\nHe prayed for Brother Joshua\\'s group– for the men who \\n\\nhad gone to take a starship and climb the heavens into a \\n\\nvaster uncertainty than any uncertainty faced by Man on \\n\\nEarth. They\\'d want much praying for; none was more \\n\\nsusceptible than the wanderer to the ills that afflict the \\n\\nspirit to torture faith and nag a belief, harrowing the mind \\n\\nwith doubts. At home, on Earth, conscience had its \\n\\noverseers and its exterior taskmasters, but abroad the \\n\\nconscience was alone, torn between Lord and Foe. Let \\n\\nthem be incorruptible, he prayed, let them hold true to the \\n\\nway of the Order. \\n\\nDoctor Cors found him in the church at midnight and \\n\\nbeckoned him quietly outside. The physician looked \\n\\nhaggard and wholly unnerved. \\n\\n\"I just broke my promise!\" he stated challengingly. \\n\\nThe abbot was silent. \"Proud of it?\" he asked at last. \\n\\n\"Not especially.\" \\n\\nThey walked toward the mobile unit and stopped in the \\n\\nbath of bluish light that spilled out its entrance. The \\n\\nmedic\\'s lab-jacket was soaked with sweat, and he dried his \\n\\nforehead on his sleeve. Zerchi watched him with that pity \\n\\none might feel for the lost. \\n\\n\"We\\'ll leave at once, of course,\" said Cors. \"I thought I\\'d \\n\\ntell you.\" He turned to enter the mobile unit. \\n\\n\"Wait a minute,\" the priest said. \"You\\'ll tell me the rest.\" \\n\\n\"Will I?\" The challenging tone once again. \"Why? So you \\n\\ncan go threaten hell-fire? She\\'s sick enough now, and so\\'s \\n\\nthe child. I\\'ll tell you nothing.\" \\n\\n\"You already have. I know who you mean. The child, too, I \\n\\nsuppose?\" \\n\\nCors hesitated. \"Radiation sickness. Flash burns. The  \\n\\nwoman has a broken hip. The father\\'s dead. The fillings in \\n\\nin the dark. Vomiting shortly after the blast. Nausea, \\n\\nanemia, rotten follicles. Blind in one eye. The child cries \\n\\nconstantly because of the burns. How they survived the \\n\\nshock wave is hard to understand. I can\\'t do anything for \\n\\nthem except the Eucrem team.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ve seen them.\" \\n\\n\"Then you know why I broke the promise. I have to live \\n\\nwith myself afterwards, man! I don\\'t want to live as the \\n\\ntorturer of that woman and that child.\" \\n\\n\"Pleasanter to live as their murderer instead?\" \\n\\n\"You\\'re beyond reasonable argument.\" \\n\\n\"What did you tell her?\" \\n\\n\"\\'If you love your child, spare her the agony. Go to sleep \\n\\nmercifully as quick as you can.\\' That\\'s all. We\\'ll leave \\n\\nimmediately. We\\'ve finished with the radiation cases and \\n\\nthe worst of the others. It won\\'t hurt the rest of them to \\n\\nwalk a couple of miles. There aren\\'t any more \\n\\ncritical-dosage cases.\"  \\n\\nZerchi stalked away, then stopped and called back. \\n\\n\"Finish,\" he croaked. \"Finish and then get out. If I see you \\n\\nagain– I\\'m afraid of what I\\'ll do.\" \\n\\nCors spat. \"I don\\'t like being here any better than you like \\n\\nhaving me. We\\'ll go now, thanks.\" \\n\\ncorridor of the overcrowded guesthouse. They huddled \\n\\ntogether under a blanket and both were crying. The \\n\\nbuilding smelled of death and antiseptic. She looked up at \\n\\nhis vague silhouette against the light. \\n\\n\"Father?\" Her voice was frightened. \\n\\n\"Yes.\" \\n\\n\"We\\'re done for. See? See what they gave me?\" \\n\\nHe could see nothing, but he heard her fingers pick at the \\n\\nedge of paper. The red ticket. He could find no voice to \\n\\nspeak to her. He came to stand over the cot. He fished in  \\n\\nhis pocket and brought out a rosary. She heard the rattle  \\n\\nof the beads and groped for it.  \\n\\n\"You know what it is?\"  \\n\\n\"Certainly, Father.\"  \\n\\n\"Then keep it. Use it.\"  \\n\\n\"Thank you.\"  \\n\\n\"Bear it and pray.\"  \\n\\n\"I know what I have to do.\"  \\n\\n\"Don\\'t be an accomplice. For the love of God, child, don\\'t–  \\n\\n\"  \\n\\n\"The doctor said– \"  \\n\\nShe broke off. He waited for her to finish; she kept silent.  \\n\\n\"Don\\'t be an accomplice.\"  \\n\\nStill she said nothing. He blessed them and left as quickly  \\n\\nas possible. The woman had handled the beads with \\n\\nfingers that knew them; there was nothing he could say to \\n\\nher that she didn\\'t already know. \\n\\n\"The conference of foreign ministers on Guam has just \\n\\nended. No joint policy statement has yet been issued; the \\n\\nministers are returning to their capitals. The importance of \\n\\nthis conference, and the suspense with which the world \\n\\nawaits the results, cause this commentator to believe that \\n\\nthe conference is not yet ended, but only recessed so that \\n\\nthe foreign ministers may confer with their governments \\n\\nfor a few days. An earlier report which alleged that the \\n\\nconference was breaking up amid bitter invective has been \\n\\ndenied by the ministries. First Minister Rekol had only one \\n\\nstatement for the press: \\'I\\'m going back to talk to the \\n\\nRegency Council. But the weather\\'s been pleasant here; I \\n\\nmay come back later to fish.\\' \\n\\n\"The ten-day waiting period ends today, but it is generally \\n\\nheld that the cease-fire agreement will continue to be \\n\\nobserved. Mutual annihilation is the alternative. Two cities \\n\\nhave died, but it is to be remembered that neither side \\n\\nanswered with a saturation attack. The Asian rulers  \\n\\ncontend that an eye was taken for an eye. Our government \\n\\ninsists that the explosion in Itu Wan was not an Atlantic \\n\\nmissile. But for the most part, there is a weird and \\n\\nbrooding silence from both capitals. There has been little \\n\\nwaving of the bloody shirt, few cries for wholesale \\n\\nvengeance. A kind of dumb fury, because murder has been \\n\\ndone, because lunacy reigns, prevails, but neither side \\n\\nwants total war. Defense remains at battle alert. The \\n\\nGeneral Staff has issued an announcement, almost an \\n\\nappeal, to the effect that we will not use the worst if Asia \\n\\nthey use dirty fallout, we shall reply in kind, and in such \\n\\nforce that no creature will live in Asia for a thousand \\n\\nyears.\\' \\n\\n\"Strangely, the least hopeful note of all comes not from \\n\\nGuam but from the Vatican at New Rome. After the Guam \\n\\nconference ended, it was reported that Pope Gregory \\n\\nceased to pray for peace in the world. Two special Masses \\n\\nwere sung in the basilica: the Exsurge quare obdormis, \\n\\nMass against the Heathen, and the Reminiscere, Mass in \\n\\nTime of War; then, the report says His Holiness retired to \\n\\nthe mountains to meditate and pray for justice. \\n\\n\"And now a word from– \"  \\n\\n\"Turn it off!\" Zerchi groaned. \\n\\nThe young priest who was with him snapped off the set \\n\\nand stared wide-eyed at the abbot. \"I don\\'t believe it!\" \\n\\n\"What? About the Pope? I didn\\'t either. But I heard it \\n\\nearlier, and New Rome has had time to deny it. They \\n\\nhaven\\'t said a word.\" \\n\\n\"What does it mean?\" \\n\\n\"Isn\\'t that obvious? The Vatican diplomatic service is on \\n\\nthe job. Evidently they sent in a report on the Guam \\n\\nconference. Evidently it horrified the Holy Father.\" \\n\\n\"What a warning! What a gesture!\" \\n\\n\"It was more than a gesture, Father. His Holiness isn\\'t \\n\\npeople will think he means \\'against the heathen\\' on the \\n\\nother side of the ocean, and \\'justice\\' for our side. Or if they \\n\\nknow better, they\\'ll still mean that themselves.\" He buried \\n\\nhis face in his hands and rubbed them up and down. \\n\\n\"Sleep. What\\'s sleep, Father Lehy? Do you remember? I  \\n\\nhaven\\'t seen a human face in ten days that didn\\'t have \\n\\nblack circles under its eyes. I could hardly doze last night \\n\\nfor somebody screaming over in the guesthouse.\" \\n\\n\"Lucifer\\'s no sandman, that\\'s true.\" \\n\\n\"What are you staring at out that window?\" Zerchi \\n\\ndemanded sharply. \"That\\'s another thing. Everybody keeps \\n\\nlooking at the sky, staring up and wondering. If it\\'s \\n\\ncoming, you won\\'t have time to see it until the flash, and \\n\\nthen you\\'d better not be looking. Stop it. It\\'s unhealthy.\" \\n\\nFather Lehy turned away from the window. \"Yes, Reverend \\n\\nFather. I wasn\\'t watching for that though. I was watching \\n\\nthe buzzards.\" \\n\\n\"Buzzards?\" \\n\\njust circling.\" \\n\\n\"Where?\" \\n\\n\"Over the Green Star camp down the highway.\"  \\n\\n\"That\\'s no omen, then. That\\'s just healthy vulture appetite. \\n\\nAgh! I\\'m going out for some air.\" \\n\\nIn the courtyard he met Mrs. Grales. She carried a basket \\n\\nof tomatoes which she lowered to the ground at his \\n\\napproach. \\n\\n\"I brought ye somewhat, Father Zerchi,\" she told him. \"I \\n\\nsaw yer sign being down, and some poor girl inside the \\n\\ngate, so I reckoned ye\\'d not mind a visit by yer old \\n\\ntumater woman. I brought ye some tumaters, see?\" \\n\\n\"Thank you, Mrs. Grales. The sign\\'s down because of the \\n\\nrefugees, but that\\'s all right. You\\'ll have to see Brother \\n\\nElton about the tomatoes, though. He does the buying for \\n\\nour kitchen.\" \\n\\n\"Oh, not for buying, Father. He- he! I brought \\'em to yer \\n\\nfor free. Ye\\'ve got lots to feed, with all the poor things yer \\n\\nputting up. So they\\'re for free. Where\\'ll I put \\'em?\" \\n\\n\"The emergency kitchen\\'s in the– but no, leave them \\n\\nthere. I\\'ll get someone to carry them to the guesthouse.\" \\n\\n\"Port \\'em myself. I ported them this far.\" She hoisted the \\n\\nbasket again.  \\n\\n\"Thank you, Mrs. Grales.\" He turned to go. \\n\\n\"Father, wait!\" she called. \"A minute, yer honor, just a \\n\\nminute of your time– \" \\n\\nit\\'s as I told you– \" He stopped, stared at the face of \\n\\nRachel. For a moment, he had imagined– Had Brother \\n\\nJoshua been right about it? But surely, no. \"It\\'s– it\\'s a \\n\\nmatter for your parish and diocese, and there\\'s nothing I \\n\\ncan– \" \\n\\n\"No, Father, not that!\" she said. \"It be somewhat else I \\n\\nwanted to ask of ye.\" (There! It had smiled! He was certain \\n\\nof it!) \"Would ye hear my confession, Father? Beg \\n\\nshriv\\'ness for bothering ye, but I\\'m sad for my naughties, \\n\\nand I would it were you as shrives me.\" \\n\\nZerchi hesitated. \"Why not Father Selo?\" \\n\\n\"I tell ye truthful, yer honor, it\\'s that the man is an \\n\\noccasion of sin for me. I go meanin\\' well for the man, but I \\n\\nlook once on his face and forget myself. God love him, but \\n\\nI can\\'t.\"  \\n\\n\"If he\\'s offended you, you\\'ll have to forgive him.\" \\n\\n\"Forgive, that I do, that I do. But at a goodly distance. \\n\\nHe\\'s an occasion of sin for me, I\\'ll tell, for I go losing my \\n\\ntemper with him on sight.\" \\n\\nZerchi chuckled. \"All right, Mrs. Grales. I\\'ll hear your \\n\\nconfession, but I\\'ve got something I have to do first. Meet \\n\\nme in the Lady Chapel in about half an hour. The first \\n\\nbooth. Will that be all right?\" \\n\\n\"Ay, and bless ye, Father!\" She nodded profusely. Abbot \\n\\nZerchi could have sworn that the Rachel head mirrored the \\n\\nnods, ever so slightly. \\n\\nHe dismissed the thought and walked over to the garage. \\n\\nA postulant brought out the car for him. He climbed in, \\n\\ndialed his destination, and sank back wearily into the \\n\\ncushions while the automatic controls engaged the gears \\n\\nand nosed the car toward the gate. In passing the gate, \\n\\nthe abbot saw the girl standing at the roadside. The child \\n\\nwas with her. Zerchi jabbed at the CANCEL button. The car \\n\\nstopped. \"Waiting,\" said the robot controls. \\n\\nThe girl wore a cast that enclosed her hips from the waist \\n\\nto left knee. She was leaning on a pair of crutches and \\n\\npanting at the ground. Somehow she had got out of the \\n\\nguesthouse and through the gate, but she was obviously \\n\\nunable to go any farther. The child was holding on to one \\n\\nof her crutches and staring at the traffic on the highway. \\n\\nZerchi opened the car door and climbed out slowly. She \\n\\nlooked up at him, but turned her glance quickly away. \\n\\n\"What are you doing out of bed, child?\" he breathed. \\n\\n\"You\\'re not supposed to be up, not with that hip. Just \\n\\nwhere did you think you were going?\" \\n\\nShe shifted her weight, and her face twisted with pain. \"To \\n\\ntown,\" she said. \"I\\'ve got to go. It\\'s urgent.\" \\n\\nget Brother– \" \\n\\n\"No, Father, no! Nobody else can do it for me. I\\'ve got to \\n\\ngo to town.\" \\n\\nShe was lying. He felt certain she was lying. \"All right, \\n\\nthen,\" he said. \"I\\'ll take you to town. I\\'m driving in \\n\\nanyway.\" \\n\\n\"No! I\\'ll walk! I\\'m– \" She took a step and gasped. He \\n\\ncaught her before she fell. \\n\\n\"Not even with Saint Christopher holding your crutches \\n\\ncould you walk to town, child. Come on, now, let\\'s get you \\n\\nback to bed.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ve got to get to town, I tell you!\" she shrieked angrily. \\n\\nThe child, frightened by its mother\\'s anger, began crying \\n\\nmonotonously. She tried to calm its fright, but then wilted: \\n\\n\"All right, Father. Will you drive me to town?\" \\n\\n\"You shouldn\\'t be going at all.\" \\n\\n\"I tell you, I\\'ve got to go!\" \\n\\n\"All right, then. Let\\'s help you in. . . the baby. . . now \\n\\nyou.\" The child screamed hysterically when the priest lifted \\n\\nit into the car beside the mother. It clung to her tightly and \\n\\nresumed the monotonous sobbing. Because of the loose \\n\\ndifficult to determine at a glance, but Abbot Zerchi guessed \\n\\nit to be a girl. \\n\\nHe dialed again. The car waited for a break in the traffic, \\n\\nthen swerved onto the highway and into the mid-speed \\n\\nStar encampment, he dialed for the slowest lane. \\n\\nbeneath the Mercy Camp sign, but they were careful to \\n\\nstay on the public right-of-way. Their freshly painted signs \\n\\nread: \\n\\nABANDON EVERY HOPE \\n\\nYE\\n\\n WHO ENTER HERE \\n\\nZerchi had intended to stop to talk to them, but with the \\n\\ngirl in the car he contented himself with watching as they \\n\\ndrifted past. With their habits and their hoods and their \\n\\nslow funereal procession, the novices were indeed creating \\n\\nthe desired effect. Whether the Green Star would be \\n\\nsufficiently embarrassed to move the camp away from the \\n\\nmonastery was doubtful, especially since a small crowd of \\n\\nhecklers, as it had been reported to the abbey, had \\n\\nappeared earlier in the day to shout insults and throw \\n\\npebbles at the signs carried by the pickets. There were two \\n\\npolice cars parked at the side of the highway, and several \\n\\nofficers stood nearby to watch with expressionless faces. \\n\\nSince the crowd of hecklers had appeared quite suddenly, \\n\\nand since the police cars had appeared immediately \\n\\nafterwards, and just in time to withess a heckler trying to \\n\\nseize a picket\\'s sign, and since a Green Star official had \\n\\nthereupon gone huffing off to get a court order, the abbot \\n\\nas the picketing, to enable the Green Star officer to get his \\n\\nwrit. It would probably be granted, but until it was served, \\n\\nAbbot Zerchi meant to leave the novices where they were. \\n\\nHe glanced at the statue which the camp workers had \\n\\nas one of the composite human images derived from mass \\n\\npsychological testing in which subjects were given \\n\\nsketches and photographs of unknown people and asked \\n\\nsuch questions as: \"Which would you most like to meet?\" \\n\\nand \"Which do you think would make the best parent?\" or \\n\\n\"Which would you want to avoid?\" or \"Which do you think \\n\\n\"most\" or the \"least\" in terms of the questions, a series of \\n\\n\"average faces,\" each to evoke a first-glance personality \\n\\njudgment had been constructed by computer from the \\n\\nmass test results. \\n\\nThis statue, Zerchi was dismayed to notice, bore a marked \\n\\nsimilarity to some of the most effeminate images by which \\n\\nmediocre, or worse than mediocre, artists had traditionally \\n\\nmisrepresented the personality of Christ. The sweet-sick \\n\\nface, blank eyes, simpering lips, and arms spread wide in a \\n\\ngesture of embrace. The hips were broad as a woman\\'s, \\n\\nand the chest hinted at breasts– unless those were only \\n\\nfolds in the cloak. Dear Lord of Golgotha, Abbot Zerchi \\n\\nbreathed, is that all the rabble imagine You to be? He \\n\\ncould with effort imagine the statue saying: \"Suffer the \\n\\nlittle children to come unto me,\" but he could not imagine \\n\\nit saying: \"Depart from me into everlasting fire, accursed \\n\\nones,\" or flogging the moneychangers out of the Temple. \\n\\nWhat question, he wondered, had they asked their \\n\\nsubjects that conjured in the rabble-mind this composite \\n\\nface? It was only anonymously a christus. The legend on \\n\\nthe pedestal said: COMFORT. But surely the Green Star \\n\\nmust have seen the resemblance to the traditional pretty \\n\\nchristus of poor artists. But they stuck it in the back of a \\n\\ntruck with a red flag tied to its great toe, and the intended \\n\\nresemblance would be hard to prove. \\n\\nThe girl had one hand on the door handle; she was eying \\n\\nthe car\\'s controls. Zerchi swiftly dialed FAST LANE. The car \\n\\nshot ahead again. She took her hand from the door. \\n\\n\"Lots of buzzards today,\" he said quietly, glancing at the \\n\\nsky out the window. \\n\\nThe girl sat expressionless. He studied her face for a \\n\\nmoment. \"Are you in pain, daughter?\" \\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter.\" \\n\\n\"Offer it to Heaven, child.\" \\n\\nShe looked at him coldly. \"You think it would please God?\" \\n\\n\"If you offer it, yes.\" \\n\\n\"I cannot understand a God who is pleased by my baby\\'s \\n\\nhurting!\" \\n\\nThe priest winced. \"No, no! It is not the pain that is \\n\\npleasing to God, child. It is the soul\\'s endurance in faith \\n\\nand hope and love in spite of bodily afflictions that pleases \\n\\nHeaven. Pain is like negative temptation. God is not \\n\\npleased by temptations that afflict the flesh; He is pleased \\n\\nSatan.\\' It\\'s the same with pain, which is often a temptation \\n\\nto despair, anger, loss of faith– \" \\n\\n\"Save your breath, Father. I\\'m not complaining. The baby \\n\\nis. But the baby doesn\\'t understand your sermon. She can \\n\\nhurt, though. She can hurt, but she can\\'t understand.\" \\n\\nWhat can I say to that? the priest wondered numbly. Tell \\n\\nher again that Man was given preternatural impassibility \\n\\nof Adam, and therefore– It was true, but she had a sick \\n\\nbaby, and she was sick herself, and she wouldn\\'t listen. \\n\\n\"Don\\'t do it, daughter. Just don\\'t do it.\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ll think about it,\" she said coldly. \\n\\n\"I had a cat once, when I was a boy,\" the abbot murmured \\n\\nslowly. \"He was a big gray tomcat with shoulders like a \\n\\nsmall bulldog and a head and neck to match, and that sort \\n\\nof slouchy insolence that makes some of them look like the \\n\\nDevil\\'s own. He was pure cat. Do you know cats?\" \\n\\n\"A little.\" \\n\\n\"Cat lovers don\\'t know cats. You can\\'t love all cats if you \\n\\nknow cats, and the ones you can love if you know them \\n\\nare the ones the cat lovers don\\'t even like. Zeke was that \\n\\nkind of cat.\" \\n\\n\"This has a moral, of course?\" She was watching him \\n\\nsuspiciously. \\n\\n\"Only that I killed him.\" \\n\\n\"Stop. Whatever you\\'re about to say, stop.\" \\n\\n\"A truck hit him, crushed his back legs. He dragged himself \\n\\ncat fight and thrash around a little, but mostly he just lay \\n\\nquietly and waited. \\'He ought to be destroyed,\\' they kept \\n\\ntelling me. After a few hours he dragged himself from \\n\\nunder the house. Crying for help. \\'He ought to be \\n\\ndestroyed,\\' they said. I wouldn\\'t let them do it. They said it \\n\\nwas cruel to let him live. So finally I said I\\'d do it myself, if \\n\\nit had to be done. I got a gun and a shovel and took him \\n\\nout to the edge of the woods. I stretched him out on the \\n\\nground while I dug a hole. Then I shot him through the \\n\\nhead. It was a small-bore rifle. Zeke thrashed a couple of \\n\\ntimes, then got up and started dragging himself toward \\n\\nsome bushes. I shot him again. It knocked him flat, so I \\n\\nthought he was dead, and put him in the hole. After a \\n\\ncouple of shovels of dirt, Zeke got up and pulled himself \\n\\nout of the hole and started for the bushes again. I was \\n\\ncrying louder than the cat. I had to kill him with the \\n\\nshovel. I had to put him back in the hole and use the blade \\n\\nof the shovel like a cleaver, and while I was chopping with \\n\\nit, Zeke was still thrashing around. They told me later it \\n\\nwas just spinal reflex, but I didn\\'t believe it. I knew that \\n\\nand wait. I wished to God that I had only let him get to \\n\\nalone– with dignity. I never felt right about it. Zeke was \\n\\nonly a cat, but– \" \\n\\n\"Shut up!\" she whispered. \\n\\n\"– but even the ancient pagans noticed that Nature \\n\\nimposes nothing on you that Nature doesn\\'t prepare you to \\n\\nbear. If that is true even of a cat, then is it not more \\n\\nperfectly true of a creature with rational intellect and will– \\n\\nwhatever you may believe of Heaven?\" \\n\\n\"Shut up, damn you, shut up!\" she hissed. \\n\\n\"If I am being a little brutal,\" said the priest, \"then it is to \\n\\nyou, not to the baby. The baby, as you say, can\\'t \\n\\nunderstand. And you, as you say, are not complaining. \\n\\nTherefore– \" \\n\\n\"Therefore you\\'re asking me to let her die slowly and– \" \\n\\n\"No! I\\'m not asking you. As a priest of Christ I am \\n\\ncommanding you by the authority of Almighty God not to \\n\\nlay hands on your child, not to offer her life in sacrifice to a \\n\\nfalse god of expedient mercy. I do not advise you, I adjure \\n\\nand command you in the name of Christ the King. Is that \\n\\nclear?\" \\n\\nDom Zerchi had never spoken with such a voice before, \\n\\nand the ease with which the words came to his lips \\n\\nsurprised even the priest. As he continued to look at her, \\n\\nher eyes fell. For an instant he had feared that the girl \\n\\nwould laugh in his face. When Holy Church occasionally \\n\\nhinted that she still considered her authority to be \\n\\nsupreme over all nations and superior to the authority of \\n\\nauthenticity of the command could still be sensed by a \\n\\nbitter girl with a dying child. It had been brutal to try to \\n\\nreason with her, and he regretted it. A simple direct \\n\\ncommand might accomplish what persuasion could not. \\n\\nShe needed the voice of authority now, more than she \\n\\nneeded persuasion. He could see it by the way she had \\n\\nwilted, although he had spoken the command as gently as \\n\\nhis voice could manage. \\n\\nThey drove into the city. Zerchi stopped to post a letter, \\n\\nFather Selo about the refugee problem, stopped again at \\n\\nZDI for a copy of the latest civil defense directive. Each \\n\\ntime he returned to the car, he half expected the girl to be \\n\\ngone, but she sat quietly holding the baby and absently \\n\\nstared toward infinity. \\n\\n\"Are you going to tell me where you wanted to go, child?\" \\n\\nhe asked at last. \\n\\n\"Nowhere. I\\'ve changed my mind.\" \\n\\nHe smiled. \"But you were so urgent about getting to  \\n\\ntown.\" \\n\\n\"Forget it, Father. I\\'ve changed my mind.\" \\n\\nsisters take care of your daughter for a few days?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'ll think about it.\" \\n\\nThe car sped back along the highway toward the abbey. As \\n\\nthey approached the Green Star camp, he could see that \\n\\nsomething was wrong. The pickets were no longer \\n\\nmarching their tour. They had gathered in a group and \\n\\nwere talking, or listening, to the officers and a third man \\n\\nthat Zerchi could not identify. He switched the car over to \\n\\nthe slow lane. One of the novices saw the car, recognized \\n\\nof stopping while the girl was in the car, but one of the \\n\\nofficers stepped out into the slow lane just ahead of them \\n\\nand pointed his traffic baton at the vehicle\\'s obstruction \\n\\ndetectors; the autopilot reacted automatically and brought \\n\\nthe car to a stop. The officer waved the car off the road. \\n\\nZerchi could not disobey. The two police officers \\n\\napproached, paused to note license numbers and demand \\n\\npapers. One of them glanced in curiously at the girl and  \\n\\nthe child, took note of the red tickets. The other waved \\n\\ntoward the now-stationary picket line. \\n\\n\"So you\\'re the bejeezis behind all this, are you?\" He \\n\\ntunic over there has a little news for you. I think you\\'d \\n\\nbetter listen.\" He jerked his head toward a chubby \\n\\ncourtroom type who came pompously toward them. \\n\\nThe child was crying again. The mother stirred restlessly. \\n\\n\"Officers, this girl and baby aren\\'t well. I\\'ll accept the \\n\\nprocess, but please let us drive on back to the abbey now. \\n\\nThen I\\'ll come back alone.\" \\n\\nThe officer looked at the girl again. \"Ma\\'am?\" \\n\\nShe stared toward the camp and looked up at the statue \\n\\ntowering over the entrance. \"I\\'m getting out here,\" she \\n\\ntold them tonelessly. \\n\\n\"You\\'ll be better off, ma\\'am,\" said the officer, eying the red \\n\\ntickets again. \\n\\n\"No!\" Dom Zerchi caught her arm. \"Child, I forbid you– \"  \\n\\nThe officer\\'s hand shot out to seize the priest\\'s wrist. \"Let \\n\\ngo!\" he snapped, then softly: \"Ma\\'am, are you his ward or \\n\\nsomething?\" \\n\\n\"Where do you get off forbidding the lady to get out?\" the \\n\\nofficer demanded. \"We\\'re just a little impatient with you, \\n\\nmister, and it had better be– \" \\n\\nZerchi ignored him and spoke rapidly to the girl. She shook \\n\\nher head. \\n\\n\"The baby, then. Let me take the baby back to the sisters. \\n\\nI insist– \" \\n\\n\"Ma\\'am, is that your child?\" the officer asked. The girl was \\n\\nalready out of the car, but Zerchi was holding the child. \\n\\nThe girl nodded. \"She\\'s mine.\" \\n\\n\"Has he been holding you prisoner or something?\" \\n\\n\"No.\" \\n\\n\"What do you want to do, ma\\'am?\"  \\n\\nShe paused.  \\n\\n\"Get back in the car,\" Dom Zerchi told her.  \\n\\n\"You cut that tone of voice, mister!\" the officer barked.  \\n\\n\"Lady, what about the kid?\"  \\n\\n\"We\\'re both getting out here,\" she said.  \\n\\nZerchi slammed the door and tried to start the car, but the  \\n\\nofficer\\'s hand flashed in through the window, hit the \\n\\nCANCEL button, and removed the key. \\n\\n\"Attempted kidnapping?\" one officer grunted to the other. \\n\\n\"Maybe,\" said the other, and opened the door. \"Now let go \\n\\nof the woman\\'s baby!\" \\n\\n\"To let it be murdered here?\" the abbot asked. \"You\\'ll have \\n\\nto use force.\" \\n\\n\"Go around to the other side of the car, Fal.\"  \\n\\n\"No!\"  \\n\\n\"Now, just a little baton under the armpit. That\\'s it, pull! \\n\\nAll right, lady– there\\'s your kid. No, I guess you can\\'t, not \\n\\nwith those crutches. Cors? Where\\'s Cors? Hey, Doc!\" \\n\\nAbbot Zerchi caught a glimpse of a familiar face coming \\n\\nthrough the crowd. \\n\\n\"Lift the kid out while we hold this nut, will you?\" \\n\\nDoctor and priest exchanged a silent glance, and then the \\n\\nbaby was lifted from the car. The officers released the \\n\\nabbot\\'s wrists. One of them turned and found himself \\n\\nhemmed in by novices with upraised signs. He interpreted \\n\\nthe signs as potential weapons, and his hand dropped to \\n\\nhis gun. \"Back up!\" he snapped. \\n\\nBewildered, the novices moved back. \\n\\n\"Get out.\" \\n\\nThe abbot climbed out of the car. He found himself facing \\n\\nthe chubby court official. The latter tapped him on the arm \\n\\nwith a folded paper. \"You have just been served with a \\n\\nrestraining order, which I am required by the court to read  \\n\\nand explain to you. Here is your copy. The officers are \\n\\nwitnesses that you have been confronted with it, so you \\n\\ncannot resist service– \" \\n\\n\"Oh, give it here.\" \\n\\n\"That\\'s the right attitude. Now you are directed by the \\n\\ncourt as folLows: \\'Whereas the plaintiff alleges that a great \\n\\npublic nuisance has been– \" \\n\\n\"Throw the signs in the ash barrel over there,\" Zerchi \\n\\ninstructed his novices, \"unless somebody objects. Then \\n\\nclimb in the car and wait.\" He paid no attention to the \\n\\nreading of the order, but approached the officers while the \\n\\nprocess server trailed behind, reading in monotonous \\n\\nstaccato. \"Am I under arrest?\" \\n\\n\"We\\'re thinking about it.\" \\n\\n\"\\'– and to appear before this court on the aforesaid date to \\n\\nshow cause why an injunction– \\'\" \\n\\n\"Any particular charge?\" \\n\\n\"We could make four or five charges stick, if you want it \\n\\nthat way.\" \\n\\nCors came back through the gate. The woman and her \\n\\nchild had been escorted into the camp area. The doctor\\'s \\n\\nexpression was grave, if not guilty. \\n\\n\"Listen, Father,\" he said, \"I know how you feel about all \\n\\nthis, but– \" \\n\\nAbbot Zerchi\\'s fist shot out at the doctor\\'s face in a \\n\\nstraight right jab. It caught Cors off balance, and he sat \\n\\ndown hard in the driveway. He looked bewildered. He \\n\\nsnuffled a few times. Suddenly his nose leaked blood. The \\n\\npolice had the priest\\'s arms pinned behind him. \\n\\n\"\\'– and herein fail not,\" the process server jabbered on, \\n\\n\"\\'lest a decree pro confesso– \\'\" \\n\\n\"Take him over to the car,\" said one of the officers. \\n\\nThe car toward which the abbot was led was not his own \\n\\nbut the police cruiser. \"The judge will be a little \\n\\ndisappointed in you,\" the officer told him sourly. \"Now \\n\\nstand still right there and be quiet. One move and you go \\n\\nin the locks.\"  \\n\\nprocess server, the doctor, and the other officer conferred \\n\\nin the driveway. Cors was pressing a handkerchief to his \\n\\nnose. \\n\\nThey talked for five minutes. Thoroughly ashamed, Zerchi \\n\\npressed his forehead against the metal of the car and tried \\n\\nto pray. It mattered little to him at the moment what they \\n\\nmight decide to do. He could think only of the girl and the \\n\\nmind, had needed only the command, I, a priest of God, \\n\\nadjure thee, and the grace to hear it– if only they had not \\n\\nforced him to stop where she could witness \"God\\'s priest\" \\n\\nsummarily overruled by \"Caesar\\'s traffic cop.\" Never to \\n\\nhim had Christ\\'s Kingship seemed more distant. \\n\\n\"All right, mister. You\\'re a lucky nut, I\\'ll say that.\" \\n\\nZerchi looked up. \"What?\" \\n\\n\"Doctor Cors refuses to file a complaint. He says he had \\n\\none coming. Why did you hit him?\" \\n\\n\"Ask him.\"  \\n\\nor just give you the summons. The court officer says \\n\\nyou\\'re well known hereabouts. What do you do?\" \\n\\nZerchi reddened. \"Doesn\\'t this mean anything to you?\" He \\n\\ntouched his pectoral cross. \\n\\n\"Not when the guy wearing it punches somebody in the \\n\\nnose. What do you do?\" \\n\\nZerchi swallowed the last trace of his pride. \"I am the \\n\\nabbot of the Brothers of Saint Leibowitz at the abbey you \\n\\nsee down the road.\" \\n\\n\"That gives you a license to commit assault?\" \\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry. If Doctor Cors will hear me, I\\'ll apologize. If \\n\\nyou give me a summons, I promise to appear.\" \\n\\n\"Fal?\" \\n\\n\"The jail\\'s full of D.P.s.\" \\n\\n\"Listen, if we just forget the whole thing, will you stay \\n\\naway from this place, and keep your gang out there where \\n\\nthey belong?\" \\n\\n\"Yes.\" \\n\\n\"All right. Get moving. But if you so much as drive past \\n\\nhere and spit, that\\'ll be it.\" \\n\\n\"Thank you.\" \\n\\nA calliope was playing somewhere in the park as they \\n\\ndrove away; and looking back, Zerchi saw that the \\n\\ncarousel was turning. One officer mopped his face, clapped \\n\\nthe process server on the back, and they all went to their \\n\\ncars and drove away. Even with five novices in the car, \\n\\nZerchi was alone with his shame. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Twenty-nine  \\n\\n\"I believe you\\'ve been warned about that temper before?\"  \\n\\nFather Lehy demanded of the penitent.  \\n\\n\"Yes, Father.\"  \\n\\n\"You realize that the intent was relatively murderous?\"  \\n\\n\"There was no intent to kill.\"  \\n\\n\"Are you trying to excuse yourself?\" the confessor  \\n\\ndemanded.  \\n\\n\"No, Father. The intent was to hurt. I accuse myself of \\n\\nviolating the spirit of the Fifth Commandment in thought \\n\\nand deed, and of sinning against charity and justice. And \\n\\nbringing disgrace and scandal upon my office.\" \\n\\n\"You realize that you have broken a promise never to  \\n\\nresort to violence?\"  \\n\\n\"Yes, Father. I deeply regret it.\"  \\n\\n\"And the only mitigating circumstance is that you just saw  \\n\\nred and swung. Do you often let yourself abandon reason \\n\\nlike that?\" \\n\\nThe inquisition continued, with the ruler of the Abbey on \\n\\nhis knees, and the prior sitting in judgment over his \\n\\nmaster. \\n\\n\"All right,\" Father Lehy said at last, \"now for your penance, \\n\\npromise to say– \" \\n\\nZerchi was an hour and a half late getting to the chapel, \\n\\nbut Mrs. Grales was still waiting. She was kneeling in a \\n\\npew near the confessional, and she seemed half asleep. \\n\\nEmbarrassed within himself, the abbot had hoped that she \\n\\nwould not be there. He had his own penance to say before \\n\\nhe could hear her. He knelt near the altar and spent \\n\\ntwenty minutes finishing the prayers Father Lehy had \\n\\nassigned him as penance for that day, but when he moved \\n\\nback toward the confessional, Mrs. Grales was still there. \\n\\nHe spoke to her twice before she heard him, and when she \\n\\nrose, she stumbled a little. She paused to feel at the \\n\\nRachel face, exploring its eyelids and lips with withered \\n\\nfingers.\"Is something wrong, daughter?\" he asked. \\n\\nShe looked up at the high windows. Her eyes wandered  \\n\\nabout the vaulted ceiling. \"Ay, Father,\" she whispered. \"I \\n\\nfeel the Dread One about, I do. The Dread One\\'s close, \\n\\nvery close about us here. I feel need of shriv\\'ness, Father– \\n\\nand something else as well.\" \\n\\n\"Something else, Mrs. Grales?\" \\n\\nShe leaned close to whisper behind her hand. \"I need be \\n\\ngiving shriv\\'ness to Him, as well.\" \\n\\nThe priest recoiled slightly. \"To whom? I don\\'t \\n\\nunderstand.\" \\n\\n\"Shriv\\'ness– to Him who made me as I am,\" she \\n\\nwhimpered. But then a slow smile spread her mouth. \"I– I \\n\\nnever forgave Him for it.\" \\n\\n\"Forgive God? How can you– ? He is just. He is Justice, He \\n\\nis Love. How can you say– ?\" \\n\\nHer eyes pleaded with him. \"Mayn\\'t an old tumater woman \\n\\nforgive Him just a little for His Justice? Afor I be asking His \\n\\nshriv\\'ness on me?\" \\n\\nDom Zerchi swallowed a dry place. He glanced down at her \\n\\nbicephalous shadow on the floor. It hinted at a terrible \\n\\nreprove her for choosing the word forgive. In her simple \\n\\nworld, it was conceivable to forgive justice as well as to \\n\\nforgive injustice, for Man to pardon God as well as for God \\n\\nto pardon Man. So be it, then, and bear with her, Lord, he \\n\\nthought, adjusting his stole. \\n\\nconfessional, and the priest noticed that when she crossed \\n\\nherself, her hand touched Rachel\\'s forehead as well as her \\n\\nown. He brushed back the heavy curtain, slipped into his \\n\\nhalf of the booth, and whispered through the grille. \\n\\n\"What do you seek, daughter?\" \\n\\n\"Blessings, Father, for I have sinned– \" \\n\\nShe spoke haltingly. He could not see her through the \\n\\nmesh that covered the grille. There was only the low and \\n\\nrhythmic whimper of a voice of Eve. The same, the same, \\n\\neverlastingly the same, and even a woman with two heads \\n\\ncould not contrive new ways of courting evil, but could only \\n\\npursue a mindless mimicry of the Original. Still feeling the \\n\\nand Cors, he found it hard to concentrate. Still, his hands \\n\\nshook as he listened. The rhythm of the words came dull \\n\\nand muffled through the grille, like the rhythm of distant \\n\\nhammering. Spikes driven through palms, piercing timber. \\n\\nAs alter Christus he sensed the weight of each burden for a \\n\\nmoment before it passed on to the One who bore them all. \\n\\nThere was the business about her mate. There were the \\n\\nmurky and secret things, things to be wrapped in dirty \\n\\nnewspaper and buried by night. That he could only make \\n\\nsense of a little of it, seemed to make the horror worse. \\n\\n\"If you are trying to say that you are guilty of abortion,\" he \\n\\nwhispered, \"I must tell you that the absolution is reserved \\n\\nto the bishop and I can\\'t– \" \\n\\nHe paused. There was a distant roaring, and the faint \\n\\nsnortgrowl of missiles being fired from the range. \\n\\n\"The Dread One! The Dread One!\" whined the old woman. \\n\\nHis scalp prickled: a sudden chill of unreasonable alarm. \\n\\n\"Quickly! An act of contrition!\" he muttered. \"Ten Aves, ten \\n\\nPater Nosters for your penance. You\\'ll have to repeat the \\n\\nconfession again later, but now an Act of Contrition.\" \\n\\nJesus Christus; ego autem eius auctoritate te absolvo ab \\n\\nomni vinculo. . . Denique, si absolvi potes, ex peccatis tuis \\n\\nego te absolvo in Nomine Patris. . .\" \\n\\nBefore he had finished, a light was shining through the \\n\\nthick curtain of the confessional door. The light grew \\n\\nbrighter and brighter until the booth was full of bright \\n\\nnoon. The curtain began to smoke. \\n\\n\"Wait, what!\" he hissed. \"Wait till it dies.\" \\n\\n\"wait wait wait till it dies,\" echoed a strange soft voice \\n\\nfrom beyond the grille. It was not the voice of Mrs. Grales. \\n\\n\"Mrs. Grales? Mrs. Grales?\" \\n\\nShe answered him in a thick-tongued, sleepy murmur. \"I \\n\\nnever meant to. . . I never meant to. . . never love. . . \\n\\nLove. . .\" It trailed away. It was not the same voice that \\n\\nhad answered him a moment ago. \\n\\n\"Now, quickly, run!\" \\n\\nNot waiting to see that she heeded him, he bounded out of \\n\\nthe confessional and ran down the aisle toward the altar of \\n\\nreservation. The light had dimmed, but it still roasted the \\n\\nskin with noon sunglare. How many seconds remained? \\n\\nThe church was full of smoke. \\n\\nHe vaulted into the sanctuary, stumbled over the first step, \\n\\ncalled it a genuflection, and went to the altar. With frantic \\n\\nhands, he removed the Christ-filled ciborium from the \\n\\ntabernacle, genuflected again before the Presence, \\n\\ngrabbed up the Body of his God and ran for it. \\n\\nThe building fell in on him. \\n\\nWhen he awoke, there was nothing but dust. He was \\n\\npinned to the ground at the waist. He lay on his belly in \\n\\nthe dirt and tried to move. One arm was free, but the \\n\\nother was caught under the weight that held him down. His \\n\\nfree hand still clutched the ciborium, but he had tipped it in \\n\\nfalling, and the top had come off, spilling several of the \\n\\nsmall Hosts. \\n\\nThe blast had swept him clean out of the church, he \\n\\ndecided. He lay in sand, and saw the remains of a rose \\n\\nbush caught in a rockfall. A rose remained attached to a \\n\\nbranch of it– one of the Salmon Armenians, he noticed. \\n\\nThe petals were singed. \\n\\nThere was a great roaring of engines in the sky, and blue \\n\\nlights kept winking through the dust. He felt no pain at \\n\\nfirst. He tried to crane his neck so as to get a look at the \\n\\nbehemoth that sat on him, but then things started hurting. \\n\\nHis eyes filmed. He cried out softly. He would not look \\n\\nback again. Five tons of rock had tucked him in. It held \\n\\nwhatever remained of him below the waist. \\n\\narm gingerly. Cautiously he picked each of them out of the \\n\\nsand. The wind threatened to send the small flakes of \\n\\nChrist wandering. Anyway, Lord, I tried, he thought. \\n\\nAnyone needing the last rites? Viaticum? They\\'ll have to \\n\\ndrag themselves to me, if they do. Or is anybody left? \\n\\nHe could hear no voices above the terrible roaring. \\n\\nA trickle of blood kept seeping into his eyes. He wiped at it \\n\\nwith his forearm so as to avoid staining the wafers with \\n\\ngory fingers. Wrong blood, Lord, mine, not Yours. Dealba \\n\\nme. \\n\\nHe returned most of the scattered Victim to the vessel, but \\n\\na few fugitive flakes eluded his reach. He stretched for \\n\\nthem, but blacked out again. \\n\\n\"JesusMaryJoseph! Help!\" \\n\\nFaintly he heard an answer, distant and scarcely audible \\n\\nunder the howling sky. It was the soft strange voice he \\n\\nhad heard in the confessional, and again it echoed his \\n\\nwords: \\n\\n\"jesus mary joseph help\" \\n\\n\"What?\" he cried. \\n\\nThe dust had begun sprinkling down. He replaced the lid of \\n\\nthe ciborium to keep the dust from mingling with the \\n\\nwafers. He lay still for a time with his eyes closed. \\n\\nThe trouble with being a priest was that you eventually \\n\\nhad to take the advice you gave to others. Nature imposes \\n\\nnothing that Nature hasn\\'t prepared you to bear. That\\'s \\n\\nwhat I get for telling her what the Stoic said before I told \\n\\nher what God said, he thought. \\n\\nThere was little pain, but only a ferocious itching that came \\n\\nfrom the captive part of him. He tried to scratch; his \\n\\nfingers encountered only bare rock. He clawed at it for a \\n\\nmoment, shuddered, and took his hand away. The itch was \\n\\nmaddening. Bruised nerves flashed foolish demands for \\n\\nscratching. He felt very undignified. \\n\\nWell, Doctor Cors, how do you know that the itch is not the \\n\\nmore basic evil than the pain? \\n\\nHe laughed a little at that one. The laugh caused a sudden \\n\\nblackout. He clawed his way out of the blackness to the \\n\\naccompaniment of someone screaming. Suddenly the \\n\\npriest knew that the screaming was his own. Zerchi was \\n\\nsuddenly afraid. The itch had been transmuted into agony, \\n\\nbut the screams had been those of raw terror, not of pain. \\n\\nThere was agony now even in breathing. The agony \\n\\npersisted, but he could bear that. The dread had arisen \\n\\nfrom that last taste of inky blackness. The blackness \\n\\nseemed to brood over him, covet him, await him hungrily– \\n\\na big black appetite with a yen for souls. Pain he could \\n\\nbear, but not that Awful Dark. Either there was something \\n\\nin it that should not be there, or there was something here \\n\\nthat remained to be done. Once he surrendered to that \\n\\ndarkness, there would be nothing he could do or undo. \\n\\nAshamed of his fright, he tried to pray, but the prayers \\n\\nseemed somehow unprayerful– like apologies, but not \\n\\npetitions– as if the last prayer had already been said, the \\n\\nlast canticle already sung. The fear persisted. Why? He \\n\\ntried to reason with it. You\\'ve seen people die, Jeth. Seen \\n\\nmany people die. It looks easy. They taper off, and then \\n\\nthere\\'s a little spasm, and it\\'s over. That inky Dark– gulf \\n\\nbetween aham and Asti– blackest Styx, abyss between \\n\\nLord and Man. Listen, Jeth, you really believe there\\'s \\n\\nSomething on the other side of it, don\\'t you? Then why are \\n\\nyou shaking so? \\n\\nA verse from the Dies Irae drifted into mind, and it nagged \\n\\nat him: \\n\\nQuid sum miser tune dicturus? \\n\\nQuem patronum rogaturus, \\n\\nCum vix justus sit securus? \\n\\n\"What am I, who am wretched, then to say? Whom shall I \\n\\nask to be my protector, since even the just man is scarcely \\n\\nsafe?\" Vix securus? Why \"scarcely safe\"? Surely He would \\n\\nnot damn the just? Then why are you shaking so? \\n\\nReally, Doctor Cors, the evil to which even you should \\n\\nhave referred was not suffering, but the unreasoning fear \\n\\nof suffering. Metus doboris. Take it together with its \\n\\npositive equivalent, the craving for worldly security, for \\n\\nEden, and you might have your \"root of evil,\" Doctor Cors. \\n\\nTo minimize suffering and to maximize security were \\n\\nnatural and proper ends of society and Caesar. But then \\n\\nthey became the only ends, somehow, and the only basis \\n\\nof law– a perversion. Inevitably, then, in seeking only \\n\\nthem, we found only their opposites: maximum suffering \\n\\nand minimum security. \\n\\nThe trouble with the world is me. Try that on yourself, my \\n\\ndear Cors. Thee me Adam Man we. No \"worldly evil\" \\n\\nexcept that which is introduced into the world by Man– me \\n\\nthee Adam us– with a little help from the father of lies. \\n\\nBlame anything, blame God even, but oh don\\'t blame me. \\n\\nDoctor Cors? The only evil in the world now, Doctor, is the \\n\\nfact that the world no longer is. What pain hath wrought? \\n\\nHe laughed weakly again, and it brought the ink. \\n\\n\"Me us Adam, but Christ, Man me; Me us Adam, but Christ, \\n\\ntogether . . . rather get nailed on it, but not alone . . . \\n\\nwhen they bleed. . . want company. Because. . . Because \\n\\nfull of Hell. I mean the same as Satan wants Hell full of \\n\\nMan. Because Adam. . . And yet Christ. . . But still me. . . \\n\\nListen, Pat– \" \\n\\nThis time it took longer to drive the inky Dark away, but he \\n\\nhad to make it clear to Pat before he went into it all the \\n\\nway. \"Listen, Pat, because . . . why it is I told her the baby \\n\\nhad to is why I. I mean. I mean Jesus never asked a man \\n\\nto do a damn thing that Jesus didn\\'t do. Same as why I. \\n\\nWhy I can\\'t let go. Pat?\" \\n\\nHe blinked several times. Pat vanished. The world \\n\\ncongealed again and the blackness was gone. Somehow he \\n\\nhad discovered what he was afraid of. There was \\n\\nsomething he had yet to fulfill before that Dark closed over \\n\\nhim forever. Dear God, let me live long enough to fulfill it. \\n\\nHe was afraid to die before he had accepted as much \\n\\nsuffering as that which came to the child who could not \\n\\ncomprehend it, the child he had tried to save for further \\n\\nsuffering– no, not for it, but in spite of it. He had \\n\\ncommanded the mother in the name of Christ. He had not \\n\\nbeen wrong. But now he was afraid to slide away into that \\n\\nblackness before he had endured as much as God might \\n\\nhelp him endure. \\n\\nQuem patronum rogaturus, \\n\\nCum vix justus sit securus? \\n\\nLet it be for the child and her mother, then. What I \\n\\nimpose, I must accept. Fas est. \\n\\nThe decision seemed to diminish the pain. He lay quietly \\n\\nfor a time, then cautiously looked back at the rock heap \\n\\nback there. The blast had broken open the crypts, for he \\n\\nnoticed a few bones caught between the rocks. He groped \\n\\nwith his free hand, encountered something smooth, and \\n\\nfinally worked it free. He dropped it in the sand beside the \\n\\nciborium. The jawbone was missing, but the cranium was \\n\\nintact except for a hole in the forehead from which a sliver \\n\\nof dry and half-rotten wood protruded. It looked like the \\n\\nremains of an arrow. The skull seemed very old. \\n\\n\"Brother,\" he whispered, for none but a monk of the Order \\n\\nwould have been buried in those crypts. \\n\\nWhat did you do for them, Bone? Teach them to read and \\n\\nwrite? Help them rebuild, give them Christ, help restore a \\n\\nculture? Did you remember to warn them that it could \\n\\nnever be Eden? Of course you did. Bless you, Bone, he \\n\\nthought, and traced a cross on its forehead with his \\n\\nthumb. For all your pains, they paid you with an arrow \\n\\nbetween the eyes. Because there\\'s more than five tons and \\n\\neighteen centuries of rock back there. I suppose there\\'s \\n\\nabout two million years of it back there– since the first of \\n\\nHomo inspiratus. \\n\\nHe heard the voice again– the soft echo-voice that had \\n\\nanswered him a little while ago. This time it came in a kind \\n\\nof childish singsong \"la la la, la-la-la– \" \\n\\nAlthough it seemed to be the same voice he had heard in \\n\\nthe confessional, surely it could not be Mrs. Grales. Mrs. \\n\\nGrales would have forgiven God and run for home, if she \\n\\nhad got out of the chapel in time– and please forgive the \\n\\nreversal, Lord. But he was not even sure that it was a \\n\\nreversal. Listen, Old Bone, should I have told that to Cors? \\n\\nListen, my dear Cors, why don\\'t you forgive God for \\n\\nallowing pain? If He didn\\'t allow it, human courage, \\n\\nbravery, nobility, and self-sacrifice would all be \\n\\nmeaningless things. Besides, you\\'d be out of a job, Cors. \\n\\nMaybe that\\'s what we forgot to mention, Bone. Bombs and \\n\\ntantrums, when the world grew bitter because the world \\n\\nfell somehow short of half remembered Eden. The \\n\\nbitterness was essentially against God. Listen, Man, you \\n\\nGod,\" as she\\'d say– before anything; before love. \\n\\nBut bombs and tantrums. They didn\\'t forgive. \\n\\nHe slept awhile. It was natural sleep and not that ugly \\n\\nmindseizing nothingness of the Dark. A rain came, clearing \\n\\nthe dust. When he awoke, he was not alone. He lifted his \\n\\ncheek out of the mud and looked at them crossly. Three of \\n\\nthem sat on the rubble heap and eyed him with funereal \\n\\nsolemnity. He moved. They spread black wings and hissed \\n\\nnervously. He flipped a bit of stone at them. Two of them \\n\\ntook wing and climbed to circle, but the third sat there \\n\\ndoing a little shuffle-dance and peering at him gravely. A \\n\\ndark and ugly bird, but not like that Other Dark. This one \\n\\ncoveted only the body. \\n\\n\"Dinner\\'s not quite ready, brother bird,\" he told it irritably. \\n\\n\"You\\'ll have to wait.\" \\n\\nIt would not have many meals to look forward to, he \\n\\nnoticed, before the bird itself became a meal for another. \\n\\nIts feathers were singed from the flash, and it kept one \\n\\neye closed. The bird was soggy with rain, and the abbot \\n\\nguessed that the rain itself was full of death. \\n\\n\"la la la, la-la-la wait wait wait till it dies la. . .\" \\n\\nThe voice came again. Zerchi had feared that it might have \\n\\nbeen a hallucination. But the bird was hearing it too. It \\n\\nkept peering at something out of Zerchi\\'s range of vision. \\n\\nAt last it hissed raucously and took wing. \\n\\n\"Help!\" he shouted weakly. \\n\\n\"help,\" parroted the strange voice.  \\n\\nAnd the two-headed woman wandered into sight around a \\n\\nheap of rubble. She stopped and looked down at Zerchi. \\n\\n\"Thank God! Mrs. Grales! See if you can find Father Lehy– \\n\\n\" \\n\\n\"thank god mrs. grales see if you can. . .\" \\n\\nHe blinked away a film of blood and studied her closely. \\n\\n\"Rachel,\" he breathed. \\n\\n\"rachel,\" the creature answered. \\n\\nShe knelt there in front of him and settled back on her \\n\\nheels. She watched him with cool green eyes and smiled \\n\\ninnocently. The eyes were alert with wonder, curiosity, \\n\\nand– perhaps something else– but she could apparently \\n\\nnot see that he was in pain. There was something about \\n\\nher eyes that caused him to notice nothing else for several \\n\\nseconds. But then he noticed that the head of Mrs. Grales \\n\\nslept soundly on the other shoulder while Rachel smiled. It \\n\\nseemed a young shy smile that hoped for friendship. He \\n\\ntried again. \\n\\n\"Listen, is anyone else alive? Get– \" \\n\\nMelodious and solemn came her answer: \"listen is anyone \\n\\nelse alive– \" She savored the words. She enunciated them \\n\\ndistinctly. She smiled over them. Her lips reframed them \\n\\nwhen her voice was done with them. It was more than \\n\\nreflexive imitation, he decided. She was trying to \\n\\ncommunicate something. By the repetition, she was trying \\n\\nto convey the idea: I am somehow like you. \\n\\nBut she had only just now been born. \\n\\ntrace of awe. He remembered that Mrs. Grales had arthritis \\n\\nin both knees, but the body which had belonged to her was \\n\\nnow kneeling there and sitting back on its heels in that \\n\\nlimber posture of youth. Moreover, the old woman\\'s \\n\\nwrinkled skin seemed less wrinkled than before, and it \\n\\nseemed to glow a little, as if horny old tissue were being \\n\\nrevivified. Suddenly he noticed her arm. \\n\\n\"You\\'re hurt!\" \\n\\n\"you\\'re hurt.\" \\n\\nZerchi pointed at her arm. Instead of looking where he \\n\\npointed, she imitated his gesture, looking at his finger and \\n\\nextending her own to touch it– using the wounded arm. \\n\\nThere was very little blood, but there were at least a dozen \\n\\ncuts and one looked deep. He tugged at her finger to bring \\n\\nher arm closer. He plucked out five slivers of broken glass. \\n\\nEither she had thrust her arm through a window, or, more \\n\\nlikely, had been in the path of an exploding windowpane \\n\\nwhen the blast had come. Only once when he removed an \\n\\ninch-long lance of glass did a trace of blood appear. When \\n\\nhe pulled the others free, they left tiny blue marks, with no \\n\\nbleeding. The effect reminded him of a demonstration of \\n\\nhypnosis he had once witnessed, of something he had \\n\\ndismissed as a hoax. When he looked up at her face again, \\n\\nhis awe increased. She was still smiling at him, as if the \\n\\nremoval of the glass splinters had caused her no \\n\\ndiscomfort. \\n\\ngray with the impersonal mask of coma. The lips seemed \\n\\nbloodless. Somehow he felt certain it was dying. He could \\n\\nimagine it withering and eventually falling away like a scab \\n\\nor an umbilical cord. Who, then, was Rachel? And what? \\n\\nThere was still a little moisture on the rain-wet rocks. He \\n\\nmoistened one fingertip and beckoned for her to lean \\n\\ncloser. Whatever she was, she had probably received too \\n\\nmuch radiation to live very long. He began tracing a cross \\n\\non her forehead with the moist fingertip. \\n\\n\"Nisi baptizata es et nisi baptizari nonquis, te baptizo. . . .\" \\n\\nHe got no farther than that. She leaned quickly away from \\n\\nhim. Her smile froze and vanished. No! her whole \\n\\ncountenance seemed to shout. She turned away from him. \\n\\nShe wiped the trace of moistare from her forehead, closed \\n\\nher eyes, and let her hands lie limply in her lap. An \\n\\nexpression of complete passivity came over her face. With \\n\\nher head bowed that way, her whole attitude seemed \\n\\nsuggestive of prayer. Gradually, out of the passivity, a \\n\\nsmile was reborn. It grew. When she opened her eyes and \\n\\nlooked at him again, it was with the same open warmth as \\n\\nbefore. But she glanced around as if searching for \\n\\nsomething. \\n\\nHer eyes fell on the ciborium. Before he could stop her, \\n\\nshe picked it up. \"No!\" he coughed hoarsely, and made a \\n\\ngrab for it. She was too quick for him, and the effort cost \\n\\nhim a blackout. As he drifted back to consciousness and \\n\\nlifted his head again, he could see only through a blur. She \\n\\nwas still kneeling there facing him. Finally he could make \\n\\nout that she was holding the golden cup in her left hand, \\n\\nand in her right, delicately between thumb and forefinger, \\n\\na single Host. She was offering it to him, or was he only \\n\\ntalking to Brother Pat? \\n\\nHe waited for the blur to clear. This time it wasn\\'t going to \\n\\nwhispered, \"sed tantum dic verbo. . .\" \\n\\nHe received the wafer from her hand. She replaced the lid \\n\\nof the ciborium and set the vessel in a more protected spot \\n\\nbut the reverence with which she had handled it convinced \\n\\nhim of one thing: she sensed the Presence under the veils. \\n\\nShe who could not yet use words nor understand them, \\n\\nhad done what she had as if by direct instruction, in \\n\\nresponse to his attempt at conditional baptism. \\n\\nHe tried to refocus his eyes to get another look at the face \\n\\nof this being, who by gestures alone had said to him: I do \\n\\nnot need your first Sacrament, Man, but I am worthy to \\n\\nconvey to you this Sacrament of Life. Now he knew what \\n\\nshe was, and he sobbed faintly when he could not again \\n\\nforce his eyes to focus on those cool, green, and \\n\\nuntroubled eyes of one born free. \\n\\n\"Magnificat anima mea Dominum,\" he whispered. \"My soul \\n\\ndoth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God \\n\\nmy Saviour; for He hath regarded the lowliness of His \\n\\nlast act, for he was certain that she shared something with \\n\\nthe Maiden who first had spoken them. \\n\\n\"Magnificat anima mea Dominum et exultavit spiritus meus \\n\\nin Deo, salutari meo, quia respexit humilitatem. . .\" \\n\\nHe ran out of breath, before he had finished. His vision \\n\\nwent foggy; he could no longer see her form. But cool \\n\\nfingertips touched his forehead, and he heard her say one \\n\\nword: \\n\\n\"Live.\" \\n\\nThen she was gone. He could hear her voice trailing away \\n\\nin the new ruins. \"la la la, la-la-la. . .\" \\n\\nThe image of those cool green eyes lingered with him as \\n\\nlong as life. He did not ask why God would choose to raise \\n\\nup a creature of primal innocence from the shoulder of \\n\\nMrs. Grales, or why God gave to it the preternatural gifts \\n\\nof Eden– those gifts which Man had been trying to seize by \\n\\nbrute force again from Heaven since first he lost them. He \\n\\nhad seen primal innocence in those eyes, and a promise of \\n\\nresurrection. One glimpse had been a bounty, and he wept \\n\\nin gratitude. Afterwards he lay with his face in the wet dirt \\n\\nand waited. \\n\\nNothing else ever came– nothing that he saw, or felt, or \\n\\nheard. \\n\\nEnd of Chapter \\n\\nChapter Thirty  \\n\\nThey sang as they lifted the children into the ship. They \\n\\nsang old space chanteys and helped the children up the \\n\\nladder one at a time and into the hands of the sisters. \\n\\nThey sang heartily to dispel the fright of the little ones. \\n\\nWhen the horizon erupted, the singing stopped. They \\n\\npassed the last child into the ship. \\n\\nThe horizon came alive with flashes as the monks mounted \\n\\nthe ladder. The horizons became a red glow. A distant \\n\\ncloudbank was born where no cloud had been. The monks \\n\\non the ladder looked away from the flashes. When the \\n\\nflashes were gone, they looked back. \\n\\nThe visage of Lucifer mushroomed into hideousness above \\n\\nthe cloudbank, rising slowly like some titan climbing to its \\n\\nfeet after ages of imprisonment in the Earth. \\n\\nSomeone barked an order. The monks began climbing \\n\\nagain. Soon they were all inside the ship. \\n\\nThe last monk, upon entering, paused in the lock. He stood \\n\\nin the open hatchway and took off his sandals. \"Sic transit \\n\\nmundus,\" he murmured, looking back at the glow. He \\n\\nslapped the soles of his sandals together, beating the dirt \\n\\nout of them. The glow was engulfing a third of the \\n\\nheavens. He scratched his beard, took one last look at the \\n\\nocean, then stepped back and closed the hatch. \\n\\nThere came a blur, a glare of light, a high thin whining \\n\\nsound, and the starship thrust itself heavenward. \\n\\nThe breakers beat monotonously at the shores, casting up \\n\\ndriftwood. An abandoned seaplane floated beyond the \\n\\nbreakers. After a while the breakers caught the seaplane \\n\\nand threw it on the shore with the driftwood. It tilted and \\n\\nfractured a wing. There were shrimp carousing in the \\n\\nbreakers, and the whiting that fed on the shrimp, and the \\n\\nshark that munched the whiting and found them \\n\\nadmirable, in the sportive brutality of the sea. \\n\\nA wind came across the ocean, sweeping with it a pall of \\n\\nfine white ash. The ash fell into the sea and into the \\n\\nbreakers. The breakers washed dead shrimp ashore with \\n\\nthe driftwood. Then they washed up the whiting. The shark \\n\\nswam out to his deepest waters and brooded in the cold \\n\\nclean currents. He was very hungry that season. \\n\\nEnd of the Book  \\n\\nM. Woolf Foundation.
