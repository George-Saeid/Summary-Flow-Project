The increase in the number of older people has been well rehearsed and their health and social 
care needs are well documented. While most health and social care professionals come into 
contact with older people in a variety of settings, it is often in the acute situation, often out of 
hours or when traditional office hour services are not available, that the challenges are most 
pressing.  Older people seldom have one single condition and usually have multiple 
comorbidities across the physical and mental health spectrum, with the added challenge of 
adverse social circumstances as the norm.  
 
Following on the success of a handbook of standards for the emergency care of children, this 
‘Silver Book’ aims to present an overview of many of the most pressing and clinical and social 
problems met by older people when they present in an emergency. The authors have put 
together a truly comprehensive review of this incredibly and increasingly important, group of 
individuals. It spans issues primarily concerning single physical problems to those concerning 
mental health and, all importantly, a combination of the two. It provides practical and 
straightforward advice in a readily digestible, yet supremely authoritative way.  It establishes 
standards for safe and effective emergency care of older people. The Silver Book should be the 
ideal companion to everyone who may come into contact with an older person in the acute 
setting and for whom the best treatment and care of that older person, while preserving their 
independence and dignity are the highest priority. It will also provide an important reference 
for those commissioning such services or studying the quality of the care delivered.

Care  

Despite the majority of urgent care being delivered in the primary care setting, an increasing 
number of older people are attending emergency departments and accessing urgent health and 
social care services. This is partly related to the demographic shift that has resulted in a rapid 
increase in the number of older people, but may also be due to lower thresholds for accessing 
urgent care. Over the next 20 years, the number of people aged 85 and over is set to increase 
by two-thirds, compared with a 10 per cent growth in the overall population. Recent national 
reports including from Patient UK, Care Quality Commission, NCEPOD and the Health Service 
Ombudsman highlighted major deficiencies in the care of older people in acute hospitals 
ranging from issues around privacy and dignity to peri-operative care. Older people are 
admitted to hospital more frequently, have longer length of stay and occupy more bed days in 
acute hospitals compared to other patient groups. There is a pressing need to change how we 
care for older people with urgent care needs, to improve quality, outcomes and efficiency. 
Emergency departments need to be supported to deliver the right care for these patients, as 
no one component of the health and social care systems can  manage this challenge in 
isolation; implementation of improved care for older people requires a whole system approach. 

Important factors in primary care that impact on the use of urgent care services include a 
timely primary care response and ready access to general practitioners. More community 
based services with a rapid response time may reduce the need to access secondary care. 
There needs to be better communication between ‘in-hours’ and out of hours services. The 
ambulance service has a key role to play and can be an important contributor in doing things 
differently – for example, referring non-conveyed patients directly to urgent care, community 
and primary care services, including falls services. 

Attendance at the Emergency Department is associated with a high risk of admission for older 
people, so the nature of the service and the environment in which it is provided needs to 
change to reflect the changing nature of health care in the 21st century, the bulk of which 
relates to older people, and increasingly frail older people. Dedicated teams delivering 
comprehensive geriatric assessment can support this, but in themselves are not sufficient to 
realise whole system change. Services in all settings including health and social care need to 
improve their communication and handover, and greater use of the voluntary sector is to be 
encouraged. In acute medical units, greater use of geriatric liaison services should increase the 
proportion of older people able to be managed in the community setting. 

In all settings, staff need to develop their understanding and confidence in managing common 
frailty syndromes, such as confusion, falls and polypharmacy as well as issues such as 
safeguarding in older people. These syndromes are commonly overlooked, but attention to 
these has the potential to greatly improve outcomes. There needs to be greater working across 
disciplines, both between professions and within professions. 

Finally, commissioning evidence based integrated health and social care systems that address 
care across the continuum will help deliver safe, efficient, effective and a high quality holistic 
care for frail older people in the years to come.

Preamble 

Despite the majority of urgent care being delivered in the primary care setting, an increasing 
number of older people are attending emergency departments and accessing urgent care 
services. This is partly related to the demographic shift that has resulted in a rapid increase in 
the number of older people, but may also be due to lower thresholds for accessing urgent 
care1. Over the next 20 years, the number of people aged 85 and over is set to increase by 
two-thirds, compared with a 10 per cent growth in the overall population. Hospital Episode 
Statistics indicate that patients over 70 years of age account for more than 2 million 
attendances per annum (15% of attendances). There are growing concerns for the safety of 
older people who are admitted to acute hospitals. The recent NCEPOD report on the peri-
operative care of older people showed inadequate care for older people undergoing surgery, 
and the Health Service Ombudsman’s report highlighted major deficiencies in the care of older 
people in acute hospitals2. Older people are admitted to hospital more frequently, have longer 
length of stay and occupy more bed days in acute hospitals compared to other patient groups.  

Aims of the guide 

The focus of this guide is on care for older people over the first 24 hours of an urgent care 
episode, with the specific remit to: 

• 
help decrease variations in practice 

• 
influence the development of appropriate services across the urgent care system 

• 
identify and disseminate best practice 

• 
influence policy development 

Methodology 

• 
The Silver Book is an intercollegiate document, prepared by the contributors listed in 
Appendix 12. It is not owned by any one individual organisation. 

• 
The initial scope of the document was agreed with the National Clinical Directors for 
Urgent Care, Older People and Dementia. 

• 
The content and literature underpinning each chapter were authored by the 
intercollegiate group, with the author for each chapter reflecting the most relevant lead 
body. 

• 
The standards and recommendations were drafted and then voted upon using a 
modified nominal group technique. 

• 
The authors have not referred to the hierarchies of evidence with regards to the 
different recommendations to avoid differential implementation, as the final standards 
and recommendation are considered to be of equal importance.  

The scope of this document is to address the care for older people, specifically frail older 
people, during the first 24 hours of an urgent care episode. The document describes the urgent 
care needs of older people and the competencies required to meet these needs. It does not 
describe how these competencies should be commissioned and delivered as this will vary 
according to local needs, resources and policies. The older person’s care needs might be 
delivered in the emergency department, the acute medical unit or a community setting 
depending on local service configuration but they need to be delivered within the first 24 hours 
and as part of a whole systems strategy. 

This document is not a NICE guideline; it represents clinical guidance and suggested 
standards, written by clinicians for clinicians. This is the complete version of the Silver Book is 
to be considered in conjunction with the executive summary and the short version available at 
http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/cardiovascular-sciences/people/conroy/silver-book and on 
the website of all the contributing organisations. 

The purpose of this document is to: 

• Help understand the issues relating to older people accessing urgent care in the first 24 
hours irrespective of geographical setting and provider group  

• Contextualise health and social  care for older people at the interface between primary and 
secondary care and pre-hospital and hospital care 

• Recommend urgent care standards for older people  

• Improve satisfaction and outcomes for older people in urgent care 

• Improve satisfaction and delivery of care by staff

Underpinning principles 

Respect for the autonomy and dignity of the older person must underpin our approach and 
practice at all times. All older people have the right to a health and social care assessment and 
should have access to treatments and care based on need, without an age-defined restriction 
to services 

A whole systems approach with integrated health and social care services strategically aligned 
within a joint regulatory and governance framework, delivered by interdisciplinary working 
with a person centred approach provides the only means to achieve the best outcomes for frail 
older people with health and social crises 

Standards 

1. All older people accessing urgent care should be routinely assessed for: 

o Pain 
o Delirium and dementia 

o Depression 
o Nutrition and hydration 

o Skin integrity 
o Sensory loss 

o Falls and mobility 
o Activities of daily living 

o Continence 
o Vital signs 

o Safeguarding issues 
o End of life care issues 

These assessments will need to be undertaken by various teams and should be prioritised 
according to the needs of the patient. 

2. The presence of one or more frailty syndrome (see Box 1) should trigger a more detailed 
comprehensive geriatric assessment, to start within 2 hours (14 hours overnight) either in 
the community, person’s own home or as an in-patient, according to the person’s needs 

3. There must be an initial primary care response to an urgent request for help from an older 
person within 30 minutes 

4. Ambulatory emergency pathways with access to multidisciplinary teams should be available 
with a response time of less than four hours for older people who do not require admission 
but need on-going treatment (e.g. in a Clinical Decisions Unit)3-6 

5. Health and social services should be commissioned such that they can contribute to early 
assessment of older people, including mental health assessments. Mental health services 
should be commissioned such that they can contribute to specialist mental health 
assessments in older people within 30 minutes if appropriate7 

6. A 24/7 single point of access (SPA) including a multidisciplinary response within two hours 
(14 hours overnight) should be commissioned. This should be coupled to a live directory of 
services underpinned by consistent clinical content (NHS pathways). Discharge to an older 
person’s normal residence should be possible within 24 hours, seven days a week – unless 
continued hospital treatment is necessary 

7. Older people coming into contact with any healthcare provider or services following a fall 
with or without a fragility fracture should be assessed for immediately reversible causes and 
subsequently referred for a falls and bone health assessment using locally agreed pathways 

Older people tend to present to clinicians with non-specific presentations or frailty syndromes, 
in contrast to the classical presentation seen in younger people. The reasons behind the non-
specific presentations include the presence of multiple comorbidities, disability and 
communication barriers. The ability to recognise and interpret non-specific syndromes is key, 
as they are markers of poor outcomes. 

Falls 

Distinguish between syncopal (e.g. cardiac, polypharmacy), or non-syncopal (strength, 
balance, vision, proprioception, vestibular and environmental hazards all to be assessed).  

Immobility 

‘Off legs’ can hide many diagnoses ranging from cord compression to end-stage dementia. A 
comprehensive assessment is needed to focus on the urgent and important issues to be 
addressed. 

Delirium and dementia 

These are closely interrelated but each requires clinically distinct management – collateral 
history is key detect a recent change in cognition; it is common for delirium to be super-
imposed on pre-existing dementia. Delirium can be hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed. 

Polypharmacy 

Adverse drug events lead to increased hospital stay, morbidity and mortality8. Consider a 
medication review focussing on identifying inappropriate prescribing, as well as drug omissions 
(e.g. STOPP/START9). Consider also medicines reconciliation  

Incontinence 

An unusual acute presentation, but a marker of frailty and a risk factor for adverse outcomes. 
More common is abuse of urine dipstick testing leading to erroneous diagnosis of infection, 
inappropriate antibiotics and increased risk of complications such as clostridial diarrhoea. 

End of life care 

Mortality rates for frail older people in the year following discharge from hospital, which 
presents  an ideal opportunity to consider advance care planning10. 

1. An acute crisis in a frail older person should prompt a structured medication review; this 
may require the support of pharmacists in some settings. 

2. When suspecting lower urinary tract infections in people unable to express themselves, 
urine dipstick testing should only be considered in patients with unexplained systemic sepsis 
(which may manifest as delirium). A urine dip should not be used to diagnose a urinary tract 
infection in coherent patients without lower urinary tract symptoms, it can be misleading. 

3. Older people should not be routinely catheterised unless there is evidence of urinary 
retention 

4. End of life care at home should be encouraged and facilitated when appropriate and in 
keeping with the older person’s preferences 

Discharge planning 

5. Older people should only be discharged from hospital with adequate support and with 
respect for their preferences 

6. Adequate and timely information must be shared between services whenever there is a 
transfer of care between individuals or services 

7. Older people being admitted following an urgent care episode (to any bed based facility) 
should have an expected discharge date set within 2 hours (14 hours overnight) 

8. Older people, and where appropriate their carers and families, should be involved in the 
decision making process around assessment and management of on-going and future care, 
and self-care 

9. Care home providers should be treated as equal partners in the planning and commissioning 
of care both for individuals and for ensuring the correct processes and procedures are in 
place in care homes to support best practice 

10. 
When preparing for discharge, older people and carers should be offered details of local 
voluntary sector organisations, other sources of information, practical and emotional 
support including information on accessing financial support and reablement services 

Recommendations for Primary Care 

11. 
There should be primary care–led management of long term conditions which may 
reduce the number of unscheduled care episodes 

12. 
General practices should monitor hospitalisation and avoidable ED attendances11 and 
determine whether alternative care pathways might have been more appropriate 

13. 
Clinicians referring to urgent care should have access to a simple referral system with 
an agreed policy provided by local geriatric, emergency medicine, acute medicine and social 
services 

Recommendations for Community hospitals 

14. 
Older people being admitted to community hospitals, whether for ‘step-up’ or ‘step-
down’ care, should be assessed and managed in the same way as people accessing urgent 
care in any other part of the health system 

15. 
There should be a distinct area in Emergency Departments which is visually and audibly 
distinct that can facilitate multidisciplinary assessments 

16. 
All units should have ready access to time critical medication used commonly by older 
people, such as Levo-Dopa 

17. 
If a procedure is required for a person who is confused, two health care professionals 
should perform the procedure, one to monitor, comfort and distract, and the other to 
undertake the procedure; carers and/or family members should be involved if possible; 
cutaneous anaesthetic gel should be considered prior to cannulation, particularly if the 
person is confused. 

18. 
All urgent and emergency care units should have accessible sources of information 
about local social services, falls services, healthy eating, staying warm, benefits and for 
carers of frail older people 

Mental Health 

19. 
All older people who self-harm should be offered a psychosocial assessment to 
determine on-going risk of self-harm and to detect and initiate management for any mental 
health problem that may be present. 

20. 
There should be easier and greater access to mental health care summary records 

21. 
Intra and inter-hospital transfers of older people at night, should be minimised as it 
increases the risk of delirium 

Recommendations on safeguarding 

22. 
Local ‘No secrets’ multiagency policies and procedures for adult safeguarding should be 
easily accessible to assist teams to identify and respond to concerns 

23. 
All services should nominate a lead responsible for safeguarding older people within the 
service whilst accepting that it is everyone’s responsibility  

24. 
All health and social care facilities must have service specific guidelines for safeguarding 
older people, in addition to the multi-agency policies and procedures  

Recommendations for Major Incident Planning 

25. 
Major Incident Plans and Disaster Preparedness Plans need to include explicit 
contingencies for the management of multiple casualties of frail older people  

26. 
Public health agencies, emergency responders, services for older people and Non-
Governmental Organisations (e.g. charities) need to be aware of the local demographics and 
communicate each other’s provision and capability so that coordination and response are 
effective in the event of an incident 

27. 
Each area/region needs to have up to date lists of named key clinicians and social care 
personnel with contact numbers, who have specific responsibilities for older people in the 
event of a major incident 

29. 
Appropriate public information on emergency preparedness in appropriate formats for 
older adults and their carers and details of local voluntary sector organisations that can 
offer information and practical support should/must be provided 

30. 
Access to a telecare system in rural and remote areas that will permit professional 
health and social care workers to reach housebound older people in the event of a major 
incident should be provided 

Recommendations for Commissioners 

31. 
Health and social care commissioners and those responsible for commissioning support 
arrangements must always reflect a joint approach across all disciplines which takes 
account of the multi-disciplinary nature of care for and working with older people.   

32. 
Commissioners should ensure that all providers of acute or emergency care for older 
people conduct audit against the standards set out in the Silver Book as well as participating 
fully in all relevant national audits (e.g. stroke, hip fracture, dementia, fall and bone health, 
continence)

Context 

Approximately 95% of urgent care is delivered in primary care. According to estimates, 
approximately 300 million urgent care consultations are annually provided in primary care12 as 
opposed to 20 million encounters in emergency departments13. A timely primary care response 
can avert the need for a hospital attendance; for example, a 1% decrease in the primary care 
response to a crisis can lead to a 20% increase in demand in secondary care. This is a 
consequence of the gearing effect of the different urgent care delivery between primary and 
secondary care. Patient characteristics including increasing deprivation and age over 65 years 
are important predictors of hospital admission rates14. Larger practices and increasing distance 
from a hospital are associated with lower admission rates14. Being able to consult a particular 
GP, an aspect of continuity, is associated with lower emergency admission rates15. General 
practitioners and community teams are crucial to the success of any efforts to improve the 
quality of urgent care. Urgent care must meet the same standards wherever delivered – 
primary care, secondary care or intermediate care. 

The primary care role notwithstanding, a substantial proportion of hospital care concerns older 
people. The oldest old (aged 85+) accounted for 585,057 of the 12.2 million (4.8%) first 
attendances to English Emergency Departments (EDs) in 2008/9, and 62% were admitted to 
hospital. People aged 85+are nearly 10 times more likely to have an emergency admission 
than those aged 20-401. The oldest old are often physically, cognitively or socially frail (i.e. 
need help with basic activities of daily living or have a diagnosis of dementia, delirium or both 
or have poor social support networks). If admitted for inpatient hospital care, the oldest old 
have the highest readmission rates and highest rate of long term care use after discharge16 17. 
Managing demand with community based preventive interventions and providing urgent care 
in community settings18 provides some scope for reducing acute hospital admissions, but 
despite the increasing availability of such care models, they have had only modest impact19-23, 
and cost effectiveness has not yet been widely and robustly demonstrated. 

Most older people who are admitted to hospital come via the Emergency Department which is 
a key interface in the health and social care system where older people with crises can be 
assessed. It is important that Emergency Departments are appropriately supported in the 
management of older people. 

The clinical assessment of frail older people is challenging because they often present non-
specifically (for example with falls, immobility, delirium) which can make the immediate 
diagnosis obscure. History taking may be challenging because of sensory impairment, 
dementia or delirium. Often additional information and collateral history is needed which may 
not be readily accessible in the emergency setting; time pressures may prevent staff from 
focussing on anything other than immediate problem. 

A positive attitude to managing frail older people is essentials; health care professionals’ 
attitudes towards frail older people could be better and ageism remains a problem in the 
health system24-26. 

Key points 

• Frail older people must be able to access the same standard of urgent care irrespective of 
where that is delivered 

• Privacy and dignity must be respected in all urgent care settings 

Context 

General practitioners can provide early and appropriate response to urgent care needs in 
primary care as well as targeted early intervention for people with long term conditions and 
care home residents. Integrated working within secondary care involving emergency 
physicians, geriatricians, acute physicians, nurses and therapists working closely with  
community mental and physical health and social care teams may provide the best model for 
decreasing admission, readmission, and minimising length of stay, morbidity and mortality. 
There must be an emphasis on evidence-based early decision making and holistic 
management. In many instances, careful and early consideration of the actual and potential 
role being played by social care in preventing admission and/or facilitating early discharge will 
pay dividends – both in terms of benefit to the older person and in terms of smoother and 
quicker pathways and patient journey. For selected people other disciplines will need to be 
involved early (e.g. surgeons and anaesthetists). Ambulance services and their response to 
emergency calls need to be part of the community services’ response to optimise the balance 
between caring for people at home with early targeted community management when 
appropriate. 

Facts 

There are several key themes that emerge from the literature which describe the pre-
requisites for successful care of frail older people27. These include: 

• Integrated care schemes including case management, geriatric assessment, 
multidisciplinary working, a single entry point and financial levers28 

• Continuity of care29 30, which can be informational, managerial or relational. This is 
characterised by the extent to which discrete healthcare events are experienced as 
'coherent, connected and consistent'. 

• A positive attitude towards older people is associated with better quality care31 

• Person centred nursing care32, encapsulated by: 

o ‘being in relation’ (knowing the individual) 

o ‘being in a social world’ (the centrality of individuals’ values) 

o ‘being in a place’ (knowing individuals’ biography and relationships) and 

o ‘being with self’ (seeing beyond the immediate needs) 

o Personalisation is the way of delivering person centred social care which also can 
include people managing their own care and increasingly their own personal budget  

If the supporting environment described above can be implemented, then specific models of 
care may be effective in ensuring that frail older people receive the right care by the right 
team and at the right time. 

Multidisciplinary care & Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment 

There is robust evidence to support multidimensional assessment and multiagency 
management of older people leading to better outcomes, including reduced readmissions, 
reduced long term care, greater satisfaction and lower costs33-43. An evidence based form of 
multidisciplinary care is Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), which is defined as ‘a 
multidimensional, interdisciplinary diagnostic process to determine the medical, psychological, 
and functional capabilities of a frail older person in order to develop a coordinated and 
integrated plan for treatment and long-term follow-up’44. While integrating standard medical 
diagnostic evaluation, CGA emphasises quality of life and functional status, prognosis, and 
outcome that entails a workup of more depth and breadth. The hallmarks of CGA are the 

Discharge planning 

Although there is some uncertainty surrounding the evidence base for discharge planning45, it 
is logical that discharge should occur as soon as the individual’s problems have been 
addressed so they can return safely to their own home. Frail old people may require complex 
support networks, both formal and informal, to support them in their own homes. Early 
attention to comprehensive discharge planning is likely to be beneficial in improving patient 
care, reducing length of stay and reducing readmissions. Discharge planning should commence 
as early as possible once the decision to admit an older person to hospital has been taken45 46, 
but must not compromise adequate assessment. 

Case study 1 An example of joint discharge planning and outreach support 

Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy received a referral for a 92 year old lady, who had 
come to A&E following a fall. She had been seen in the majors area where bony injuries had 
been ruled out, and transferred to the Emergency Frailty Unit for Comprehensive Geriatric 
Assessment.  

The lady normally lived alone in a bungalow, receiving carers twice a day for personal care. 
She had good informal support from friends and family. She was adamant she wanted to go 
home and declined going for a period of rehabilitation before returning home. She was 
assessed by physiotherapy as independent mobilising with her mobilator around the ward, 
despite having limitations on her functional range of movement and strength due to arthritis. 
The occupational therapist (OT) found her to be independent on and off the bed, chair and 
toilet with her existing equipment and declined any extra help with meal preparation and 
domestic activities. The therapists referred her for an outreach visit. 

The patient returned home that night and the OT visited the patient the following morning to 
conduct an outreach follow-up. On arrival at her house the OT found an ambulance crew in 
attendance as the lady had fallen overnight. The ambulance crew carried out the relevant 
medical tests and the OT helped them mobilise her to the bathroom so she could be cleaned 
up. She was found to be independently mobile around her bungalow, and able to manage on 
and off all of her furniture with the existing equipment. The lady refused to go to hospital, and 
refused an intermediate care bed, but was persuaded to receive carers at mealtimes, which 
was arranged during the visit. A referral to intermediate care was also arranged to practice 
meal tasks as the patient wanted to remain independent with these in the long-term. 

‘This outreach visit was a great opportunity to work alongside our community colleagues to 
really make a difference for this patient. She got to return home but with increased services 
that she had initially thought she didn’t need. Our goal was to reduce the risk of her falling and 
of needing to come to hospital again. We arranged extra support to help get her back on her 
feet and return to her previous baseline, or better’. (Senior OT) 

Promoting wellbeing 

Alongside the medical reasons that bring older people in contact with urgent and emergency 
care services, problems affecting their general wellbeing may have been building up over time. 
These are often social problems, such as living alone or having heavy caring responsibilities, 
financial worries, difficulties maintaining and managing their home, loneliness and isolation. As 
well as addressing medical and social care needs it is important to aim to put older people 
back in a position to cope and help them live as fulfilling lives as possible. As well as statutory 
services, voluntary sector organisations can help older people who live alone or with a partner 
to maintain as much control as possible over their own lives, to resume or engage in social 
activities that are important to them and reduce isolation. Such support can improve general 
wellbeing and help reduce the likelihood of needing to call upon urgent or emergency services 
in the future. 

Whole systems approach 

Multidimensional assessment and multiagency management of older people leads to better 
outcomes47. For such services to be effective, they must be delivered in an integrated manner 
across the primary and secondary care, and health and social care interface (Appendix 9).   is

Urgent care at home 

Context and facts 

The current system of health and social care is not joined up and struggles to meet the urgent 
care needs of older people. All too often the default position is for frail older people is to be 
taken to the Emergency Department (ED), with a high probability of being admitted to 
hospital. Very rarely is the urgent care need in the first 24 hours entirely dependent on a 
response by health services in this group of people. There are often inadequate or poorly 
coordinated services to care for older people safely in the community if this is clinically 
appropriate; support for carers is also variable. A consistent 24/7 urgent care response is 
important. 

Despite some variation within defined parameters, response times for an urgent health need 
are measured in minutes for the ambulance service, but in hours for other health services, 
including GP services with often greater variability in the urgent care response by GP practices 
during office hours compared to out of hours.  

There is also a mismatch and variability with the extent, speed and integration of response of 
health and social care which is essential for caring for older people in the community with 
urgent healthcare needs. The number of service users 65 years and over receiving community 
based services provided by local authorities has reduced (Figure 2) and the speed of the social 
care response through assessment (Figure 3) has hardly changed in recent years. These 
minimum time frames for a social care response with an assessment are not always conducive 
to an urgent care response that will support older people being looked after in the community 
in their own homes with immediate care needs. All too often older people are referred to ED or 
admitted to hospital because of a lack of timely social care rather than there being a clinical 
indication for this level of care.

Despite the growing population of people aged 65+, especially those over 85 years, the 
number of residents supported in residential or nursing homes has been in decline. This means 
that even before the current austerity measures of reduced funding to local authorities, most 
vulnerable older people will be living independently. To effectively address the needs of older

Key points 

• Any urgent care service response to older people must be person focused and driven by 
individual needs. 

• People must be treated as individuals with dignity and respect; their wishes and those of 
their carers must be acknowledged, with shared decision making based on clinical 
considerations. 

• Advance care planning and patient held records can support appropriate decision making 
in the contact of long term conditions management and end of life care. 

• Disease prevalence alone cannot explain the rise in self-referrals and attendances1 at ED, 
with those aged 65+ more likely to be admitted. More consistent and timely urgent same 
day access to GPs during working hours is required. 

• GPs working jointly with pharmacists undertaking medicine reviews can lead to better 
outcomes including reduced falls and hospital admissions49.  

• When there is an urgent or emergency care need frail older people, their carers or 
professionals involved in their care should only need to make one phone call to a central 
telephone number to mobilise a ‘24/7 integrated health and social care response’ to 
address their needs, be they physical, psychological, social or to support carers 

• A 24/7 integrated health and social care response should include an initial contact by the 
integrated rapid response team on the telephone within 30 minutes and an appropriate 
rapid assessment within 2 hours (14 hours overnight) with the necessary arrangements 
instituted to address the older person’s acute health and social care needs and the support 
needs of their dependants or carers over the following 24 hours12. This should also act as a 
trigger for more detailed assessments e.g. falls and other care packages thereafter 

• There should be a ‘24/7 Integrated Rapid Response Team’ staffed by health and social 
care professionals. Key roles include prescribing, nursing, occupational therapy, 
physiotherapy and social care. An integrated rapid response team coordinating care in the 
first 24 hours could then put into motion other measures and assessments to support 
recovery and independence. 

• For more complex urgent health care needs the older person’s GP or out of hours service 
can be contacted to review as part of the integrated urgent care response. When specialist 
medical advice is required community geriatricians should be available to give advice on 
issues of medical management. 

• Reablement services are not only relevant after discharge from hospital but also as part of 
the integrated health and social care response in managing older people with acute 
medical needs in the community when clinically acceptable to do so. 

• The use of telehealth and telecare may help support older people in their own homes, 
especially to anticipate problems and to support treatment and monitoring. 

Context and facts 

GP out of hours services are charged with delivering general medical services in the out of 
hours period (18.30-08.00) every day. There is a legal requirement on commissioners of GP 
services to deliver this service to the population. While services can use any skill mix they 
deem appropriate, there is a requirement to deliver access to a GP if required. 

Caring for older people out of hours presents its own set of challenges. The clinician will not be 
familiar with the individual’s history or understand all the local services available. Clinicians, 
who only work occasional sessions face particular challenges in updating themselves on best 
practice and, in some cases, may feel under pressure to complete too many episodes per hour 
and potentially rush decision making. Special notes or care plans summarising care agreed 
with the doctor or nurse responsible for their care during the day have great potential for 
improving continuity of care. 

The main challenge for services is that acutely ill older people are very sensitive to delays in 
care. The longer they wait for a definitive consultation, opinion, investigation and treatment, 
the more likely they are to end up attending the hospital. Services do have national standards 
to adhere to, mainly in terms of response times. These are, however, dependent on a solid and 
high quality clinical prioritisation system which ensures that those at risk of admission do not 
wait hours before being seen. 

Out of hours services are particularly important for people nearing the end of their lives. In too 
many places older people are admitted only to die shortly after in hospital despite good care 
plans being in place. The plans fail either as a result of poor communication with the out of 
hours provider or poor use of the information by the out of hours provider or lack of other 
support services. 

Services everywhere are under significant pressure to avoid admissions and reduce costs. 
There tends to be an implicit assumption that this should be delivered alongside the highest 
possible quality of care. When admission avoidance is seen as the top priority, it may result in 
poorer quality care for some older people inappropriately denied hospital care. 

Aside from the role of assessing older people in the community, out of hours services can also 
help with expedited discharge from the acute setting. 

Case study 2 Out of hours services and urgent care 

‘If we all did the basics right, things would go a lot more smoothly. A recent typical incident 
concerned a 77 year man with sudden onset of leg oedema. He was seen at his home by his 
GP at 3.30pm on a Protected Learning afternoon. The GP phoned the Primary Care Assessment 
Unit (PCAU) to arrange an assessment. The GP booked a 1 hour ambulance and specifies PCAU 
and gets records faxed to PCAU (the GP did not go via the Single Point of Access (SPA), which 
would be normal process). The ambulance took 2.5 hours to arrive with no further 
communication, took the patient to local Acute Medical Unit, not PCAU. The AMU ad no record 
and patient got sent to the ED. At 8.30pm patient's wife phones to ask why he was in ED; 
however by then it was too late to access PCAU, where GP goes home at 10pm (bloods take 
two hours) so the patient was admitted unnecessarily. 

Key points 

• Commissioners should seek to ensure a consistent response around the clock 

• There is a responsibility on the older person’s host general practice to ensure the local out 
of hours service is aware of patients at risk, those with special needs and those with end 
of life care plans. 

• Timely access to relevant information is necessary for good clinical decision making; 
ensuring that there is good communication with other local services is central to a well-
functioning integrated urgent care response 

Context and facts 

Ambulance services cost around £1.9Bn or 2% of NHS spend each year but have an impact on 
over £20Bn or 20% of NHS spend (National Audit Office, 2011). The regional NHS ambulance 
services receive and respond to approximately 7.5 million emergency calls each year; in 
addition to providing a high quality emergency clinical response to patients they also have an 
essential role in the care of patients with urgent care needs to dial 999.  

Increasingly, ambulance services are being recognised as having a wider role, as being pivotal 
to the performance of the entire urgent and emergency care system. They have developed 
considerably from the days when their only response was to transport patients to hospitals. 
Ambulance services now manage between 30% and 50% of all 999 calls without taking a 
person to a hospital, by providing advice (hear & treat), referring to an appropriate alternative 
service (see & refer), or by treating the person on scene (see & treat).  As a result of the 
implementation of these local services, the role of NHS ambulance services, and the skills and 
competencies of their clinicians, has changed significantly. Responsive ambulance services that 
can initiate an effective emergency response, but that are well integrated with unscheduled but 
non-emergency care can therefore be critical to effective demand management, and the 
efficiency of wider local health systems. There is good evidence to support the role of the 
ambulance services in both providing high quality clinical care and signposting patients to the 
right care, either through telephone or face to face clinical assessment. This is supported by 
the development of intelligent telephone triage systems (such as NHS Pathways) that are 
linked via a capacity management system (CMS) to local directories of health and social care 
services (DoS) which Ambulance Trusts are implementing  to support system planning  and 
management. Ambulance services will continue to have an increasing role in the centre of 
urgent and emergency care systems providing emergency care for those who need it and to 
utilise alternative care pathways. 

Ambulance clinicians, predominantly paramedics, face a number of challenges when 
responding to older people, especially those who live alone or are cognitively impaired. This, 
compounded by polypharmacy, complex co-morbidities and a frequent lack of patient 
information, makes the assessment of urgent rather than emergency conditions more difficult 
and the decision to manage the individual safely at home more challenging. Lack of an 
integrated community-based approach in risk assessment and information sharing also adds to 
this risk.  

Responding to urgent care needs; including call handling, signposting and face to face clinical 
management would be safer if it was part of a commissioned, integrated, systematic, health 
and social care response to urgent and emergency care needs in older people. 

The new Ambulance Clinical Quality Indicators relate to all aspects of pre-hospital emergency 
and urgent care for older people, and influence outcomes (Table 1).

The Quality Innovation Prevention and Productivity (QIPP) urgent care work stream involves: 

• A Single Point of Access 

• Local Directory of Services 

• Commonality of offer 

• GP dashboard  

A 10 per cent reduction in the number of people attending Emergency Departments (EDs) will 
need to be achieved as part of the QIPP agenda for urgent care. This has implications for 
regional NHS Ambulance Trusts. It presents challenges when managing appropriate patients 
safely, without immediate conveyance to Emergency Departments. This should either be 
through conveyance to suitable alternative systems or preferably through management at 
home using alternative care pathways. In the absence of an integrated response available 
24/7, these outcomes will not be achievable. There are good examples of alternative pathways 
for older people with falls leading to improved outcomes e.g. through referral to community 
falls services which can reduce falls-related hospital attendances50. advanced paramedics who 
have completed a specific education programme51 can provide the initial management and 
stabilisation of a variety of conditions including hypoglycaemia, COPD, heart failure and other 
‘frequent fallers’.

Emergency Department 

Context and facts 

The delivery of such complex interventions, such as Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment 
(CGA) is challenging within a busy, time-constrained ED. Several studies have examined the 
role of a team identifying older people in the ED and delivering coordinated care in the 
community setting upon discharge52-56 and a meta-analysis of these studies provide some 
evidence of improved outcomes57. Hospital at home schemes that include multidisciplinary care 
and medical input can be effective18 35 36 45 and could support ED based teams such as those 
described above, as well as reducing the need to access EDs. 

Key points 

Environment 

• The assessment area for older people should be located in a quieter, preferably separate, 
area of the department where observation is possible but noise, interruptions, over 
stimulation and so on is minimised. However it should not be close to an exit. 

• EDs should be configured in such a way that they can screen for common frailty 
syndromes in all older people, and then initiate (but not necessarily deliver entirely) more 
detailed assessments in selected individuals, This will need to be commissioned and 
provided on a local basis according to locally agree pathways and service models. 

Food and drink should be readily available; helping with nutrition should be provided 
when necessary ( 

• Case study 3) 

Case study 3 

An 82 year old lady with cognitive impairment is found by her carer lying on the floor at 9am.  
She had fallen the previous evening sometime around 8pm and lain overnight. She is confused 
and sleepy. The GP is called who attends at 10 am. He calls an ambulance which arrives 
around 11am. The patient is first seen in the department around 12noon (it has been a busy 
day) and is eventually transferred to the receiving ward at about 3pm. She is written up for IV 
fluids which because of her advanced age the doctor has prescribed cautiously and is started 
around 3:30pm. Her hypoactive delirium has become more marked and so she is barely able 
to manage meals and cannot reach the oral fluids on her bedside table and is too sleepy to 
express thirst. Up to 21 hours could have passed since she last had a reasonable meal or drink 
and her delirium will have been exacerbated by inadequately managed dehydration.  

• The Emergency Department should be ‘age-friendly’, with signs in large font as added 
visual aid accompanied by pictures. Signs to toilets should be bold, visible and multicue 
i.e. a picture of a toilet beside a toilet sign. All signage should at eye level so the older 
person does not have to crane their neck to read it as this can cause them to lose their 
balance. Pictures in the cubicles should also be hung at eye level so the individual can 
gaze at them without discomfort58. 

• Bins should all have silent lids, those that snap down and make a loud bang cause 
unnecessary distress to those who are confused and visually impaired (Case study 4). 

Case study 4 

An older Iranian lady was brought to the ED by her daughter, who was her main carer. The 
lady was blind and had advanced dementia. She was quiet and lying on the trolley waiting to 
be assessed by the doctor. Suddenly she became very distressed, crying and trying 
desperately to climb off the trolley. Her daughter was exasperated and upset because what 
had disturbed her mother was the sudden banging noise of bin lids snapping shut, and the 
thoughtlessness of staff who did not anticipate that such sudden noises may cause undue 
distress to a blind patient who also had dementia. This lady had lived through the Iran /Iraq 
war and any sudden loud noises were a source of terror and anxiety to her. It took a long time 
to calm and settle the patient. 

• Clinical equipment should be kept to an absolute minimum and where possible create an 
ambience consistent with the age of the individual (examples that are proven to work are 
pastel shades, flowery curtains, pictures, a clock with large numbers, comfortable 
armchair). 

• If the department also had a clinical decisions unit (CDU) or short stay unit (SSU) it is 
helpful to replicate exactly the décor from the ED to one of the cubicles in CDU so transfer 
does not add to confusion59. 

Interventions 

• Certain conditions common in older people require rapid access to relevant medication, 
such as such as Leva-Dopa for Parkinson’s disease. 

• Older people with cognitive impairment or sensory deprivation may become distressed by 
interventions such as cannulation or urinary catheterisation 

• For selected older people, comprehensive geriatric assessment should commence within 
four hours (maximum 2 hours (14 hours overnight)) of point of access to a hospital 

Information 

• Older people attending the emergency department do so because of a crisis. This may be 
medical, psychological, social or and other form of crisis. This presents an ideal 
opportunity to offer information to older people at a time when it is most relevant to their 
needs. Information sharing, verbal or written should be tailored and presented in a format 
which is easy to understand. 

Context and facts 

In 2007 the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) urged Acute Medical Units (AMUs) to ‘tailor their 
operations to meet the needs and expectations of an ageing population with more complex 
illness’60. 

Key points 

There should be no discrimination on the basis of individuals’ age when decisions are made 
about access to acute medical services, and about the quality of service subsequently provided 
and received60. 

Models of care 

The RCP considered a variety of models of care for admitting older people to an AMU, but in 
order to limit discrimination, models based on age were rejected. However, they recognised 
that older people with complex needs would benefit from prompt review by specialist geriatric 
teams comprising geriatricians and a multidisciplinary team. The British Geriatrics Society 
recommends that there is a role for a dedicated geriatrician embedded within the AMU 
focussing on frail older people61, similarly physiotherapists and occupational therapists should 
be employed in Assessment units. The presence of a frailty syndrome, evidence based risk 
stratification tools, or locally acceptable policies62 may be used by to identify older people with 
complex needs. 

Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) can lead to improved function and quality of life, 
and reduce hospital stay, re-admission rates and institutionalisation. An AMU is a suitable 
environment to complete CGA and initiate appropriate interventions. Internationally, Acute 
Geriatric Units have been shown to reduce the risk of functional decline and increase the 
probability of returning home34, such units have not been compared directly to an AMU in the 
UK. 

A good example of a specialist team which has improved outcomes in this setting is the Older 
Persons’ Assessment and Liaison team (OPAL)63. 

Exact models of care will be dictated by the local population and services and resources 
available within, and outside the hospital. 

Community hospitals 

Context and facts 

Within the United Kingdom there are over 400 Community Hospitals. In the past such hospitals 
were reserved for rehabilitation of largely well people who had spent their acute illness phase 
in acute hospitals. This has altered significantly and in the past few years people being 
admitted to community hospitals admitted are typically frail older people, and increasingly are 
admitted directly from their homes, and may be more acutely unwell than in the past. This 
presents a challenge for staff to assure the environment, whilst maintaining a caring homely 
atmosphere can meet the needs of such older people. 

Medical models of care differ from hospital to hospital with some having local GP’s input each 
day, with out of hours cover in the evenings and weekends. Others have a named doctor 
responsible for the provision of care with a consultant providing a weekly input. In some areas 
nurse practitioners are increasingly becoming part of the provision of care in community 
hospital wards. 

Also community hospitals vary ‘greatly in their role and function with a very broad range of 
different services provided’64. In addition the clear policy direction of providing care in the 
community closer to home65 has been a key driver in care provision in community hospital 
settings. This has led to a need for staff skills and competency to encompass the care of older 

Community hospitals are part of the community and should have excellent links with 
community teams enabling communication to be swift and personal which should lead to a 
greater integration between hospital and home care.  

Key points 

• Older people’s assessments need to be comprehensive and provided by skilled medical and 
nursing clinicians in a timely manner, within 2 hours (14 hours overnight) of admission 

• Signs of deterioration maybe subtle in older people and as the community hospital may 
not have the full resources available to them it is essential that staff are vigilant in 
recognising and responding effectively, in order to prevent an emergency situation 

• Medicine reconciliation in community hospital settings should be as stringent as in acute 
care to assure older people are not exposed to unnecessary polypharmacy or missed 
medications 

• Investigations need to be conducted in a timely manner and not viewed as if the individual 
was in their own home 

• All staff involved in assessment and examination must have competence in older peoples 
care needs and have an in depth understanding of the long term condition management 

Context and facts 

Older people will benefit from the same level of assessment as people of any age, for example, 
early warning scores predict mortality in older people66-72. However, some frail older people 
may need additional assessments which are not currently mandatory. The delivery of a holistic 
assessment is challenging within urgent care, and careful thought needs to be given as to the 
best place where such assessment can be continued – this could be as an in-patient, or in the 
community setting. Some of the important assessments to be considered in the urgent care 
context are detailed below:

There are two common organic brain syndromes, dementia and delirium. 40% of people over 
age 70 admitted to medical wards have dementia, 20% of these from care homes, yet 40% 
have Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions that might be amenable to treatment without 
recourse to hospital admission73. 

Dementia and delirium are syndromes and not pathologies and so the diagnosis is entirely 
dependent on the skill of health professionals. Some features are common to both:  

• both age related (increasing with age, particularly after age 65) 

• both under/misdiagnosed (50% of dementia in the community and general hospital is 
undiagnosed, 50% of delirium in hospital is undiagnosed and they are often mistaken for 
each other or for other mental disorders) 

• both are common presentations in the emergency sector 

• both predict a poor outcome with increased mortality, length of hospital say and admission 
to institutional care73-76 

Routine assessment of cognition will identify moderate to severe cognitive impairment. The 4-
point Abbreviated Mental Test score (AMT-4)is quick to complete, and has good correlation 
with the 10 point scale but is easier to apply requiring only place, age, date of birth and year77. 
However the detection of cognitive impairment in the ED context should always be 
accompanied by an assessment for delirium (see below). 

Dementia is a chronic disorder, the course is slowly progressive, typically with a history of 
several months and more and usually caused by irreversible degenerative brain disease. 
People with dementia will come to the attention of emergency services for a number of 
reasons: 

• new medical problems that may be accompanied by delirium (most commonly, falls, 
infections, fractures, loss of consciousness) 

• decompensated long term conditions due to compliance problems 

• neglect 

• abuse 

• behavioural symptoms (if new these may represent delirium) 

• social breakdown 

For most people with dementia admitted to hospital there will be a primary medical diagnosis 
(or more often diagnoses) and the importance of dementia is overlooked. 

Episodes of disturbed behaviour, referred to as the Behavioural & Psychological Symptoms of 
Dementia (BPSD), will occur in over 90% of people with dementia at some point. Typically, 
these present in the moderate and severe stages of dementia. Managing BPSD can be difficult 
and requires a careful analysis of contributing factors that will include physical (e.g. pain), 
psychological (e.g. depression, hallucinations) and environmental (e.g. change). People with 
dementia are notoriously susceptible to change of environment or routine that can precipitate 
BPSD, for example, admission to hospital. New onset BPSD should prompt a suspicion of 
superimposed delirium, which can be precipitated with relatively minor physical illness in 
people with dementia. Concern over inappropriate prescribing of antipsychotic drugs for people 
with dementia has led to a new national agenda to reduce the use of these drugs and 
indications for appropriate prescribing are clear for people with dementia and delirium and 
management includes non-pharmacological as well as pharmacological interventions76 78.

found at:

http://www.bgs.org.uk/Publications/Publication%20Downloads/Delirious-about-dementia.pdf 

Delirium 

Delirium has acute onset, the course typically over days and weeks. The major risk factors for 
delirium are increasing age (three times more common over age 65) and dementia/cognitive 
impairment (6-11 times more common), severity of illness and hip fracture76. It is a common 
non-specific presentation of physical illness in older people and the most common complication 
of a hospital admission79. Despite this, it is poorly detected and recorded with 33-66% of cases 
undiagnosed or misdiagnosed79-81. Failed detection in emergency departments is associated 
with a seven-fold hazard for increased mortality79 82, and delirium in the ED is an independent 
predictor of hospital length of stay83. Symptoms may not only be cognitive. They may be 
behavioural, psychotic (hallucinations, delusions) or mood symptoms with little or absent signs 
of disorientation or cognitive impairment. For example, symptoms of depression in a delirious 
individual may be indistinguishable from people suffering from depressive disorder. The key is 
to suspect delirium with any sudden change of mental state or behaviour in older people. 
Characteristic signs of delirium, which also help distinguish this from dementia, are: 

• clouded consciousness 

• poor attention and concentration 

• a fluctuating pattern of symptoms 

The importance of distinguishing delirium from dementia is critical but not always 
straightforward. People with dementia are 6-11 times more likely to develop delirium, this co-
morbidity can be difficult to recognise. Recognition is essential as delirium is a common 
presentation of acute physical illness (with no localising signs) in people with dementia. The 
key is the history of acute onset and short duration of new symptoms. Information from carers 
or third parties is essential and will often hold the key. 

Both conditions will often pose questions about a person’s capacity to make health and welfare 
decisions; all emergency sector professionals need to have a good knowledge of capacity and 
mental health legislation to deal appropriately with the person who is incapable of consenting 
to treatment.

found at:

http://www.bgs.org.uk/Publications/Clinical%20Guidelines/clinical_1-2_delirium.htm 

There are few statistics on the frequency with which older people display aggression and overt 
violence in emergency care settings. The Healthcare Commission’s National Audit of Violence 
2006-07, (RCPsych 2007) looking at violent incidents on acute psychiatric in-patient units 
found the highest levels of physical assaults on staff by patients occurred on wards for older 
people with organic impairments. The frailty of the patients did not prevent serious injuries 
being inflicted. These incidents occurred despite the staff involved being skilled at using 
person-centred approaches to maximise dignity and good compliance with standards for 
privacy and choice. It is likely that issues will sometimes arise in emergency care settings 
where action will be needed to protect staff and other patients from acts of aggression and 
where tranquillisation will be needed to allow adequate assessments of individual’s physical 
health. 

Guidance on the short-term management of disturbed / violent by psychiatric patients in 
emergency departments has been issued by NICE (2005). This derives chiefly from 
recommendations on the management of physically fit people with functional illness in in-
patient psychiatric settings. 

Ill older people will not always be able to articulate the reasons for their distress and it is 
always important to establish whether pain, constipation, urinary retention or psychosis lie 
behind disturbed behaviour. The NICE guideline gives helpful advice on recognising situations 
which may progress to violence and how to avert this (de-escalation). Medication should only 
be used where it is the safest and least restrictive way of managing behaviour, which is a 
serious risk to other patients, the staff or other people in the emergency setting, or to patients 
themselves. (See appendix for an example of a policy.) 

http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10964/29715/29715.pdf 

Depression is the commonest mental health problem in old age, and aetiological factors such 
as social isolation and chronic physical illness mean that an ageing population will be a more 
depressed one too. The Geriatric Depression Score-584 is a quick useful tool to screen for 
depression, shorter versions are available that might be suitable for brief screening in the ED 
(e.g. GDS-1). 

Self-harm in older people is much less common than at a younger age; of 5038 consecutive 
self-harm attendances in one Emergency Department, 110 (2.2%) were of people aged 65 
years or over 85. However older people who self-harm have high levels of suicidal intent86 87 
and often have on-going suicidal ideation after presentation. Older people comprise about 25% 
of all UK suicides, and there is a much stronger association between self-harm or completed 
suicide and mental health problems in old age than in adults of working age. About 15% of 
older people with a first episode of self-harm go on to repeat the act, and there is a 49-fold 
increase in risk of suicide87. The adverse effects on cognitive function of common drugs used in 
self-harm, such as tricyclic antidepressants, may make detection of the act more difficult.  
Additionally, older people with delirium or dementia may present with unintentional self-harm 
which, if undetected, could have adverse consequences.   

Older people who present with self-harm are more likely to receive a psychosocial assessment 
and be admitted to the general hospital than adults of working age88. This may be because 
they are perceived as high risk, or because they more commonly use methods requiring 
physical treatment as an in-patient. Mental health services for older people are often 
configured differently to those for adults of working age, with less provision of specialist liaison 
input into general hospital settings including emergency departments89.  NICE states that 
mental health professionals must be experienced in assessing older adults who have self-
harmed to undertake assessment of this age group90.  This means that a rapid response for 
psychosocial assessment after self-harm may not be available from an adequately skilled 
clinician. Many parts of the UK lack the equivalent of crisis teams for older people, meaning 
that alternatives to mental health admission are not available for some older people, who may 
then spend more time in the emergency department and in general hospital wards. 

Alcohol and substance abuse 

Alcohol and substance is a problem in older people although less common than in younger age 
groups, in part related to survivor bias. Older people are more vulnerable to the adverse 
effects of alcohol and substance abuse, because of changes in physiology and drug handling, 
comorbidities and polypharmacy. Safe drinking levels are the same for older people as for 
younger people (14 units of alcohol a week for women, 21 units for men) although in practice 
safe drinking levels are probably less than this.

ople.aspx 

Falls 

Falls are also the commonest single reason for older people to present to urgent care. Falls are 
not an inevitable part of ageing but are often due to underlying disease or impairment that 
may be amendable to treatment or modification. 

Screening for falls risk 

Even if not presenting with a fall, all older people presenting to urgent care should be asked 
whether they have fallen in the past year. If a person reports a fall, a more detailed history of 
the frequency and circumstance(s) of falls should be taken. Further assessment depends on 
the level of future falls risk for that individual. The American Geriatrics Society/British 

• Have you had two or more falls in the last 12 months? 

• Have you presented acutely with a fall? 

• Do you have problems with walking or balance (not necessarily restricting activity)?  

If a person gives a positive answer to any of these questions, they should be considered at 
high-risk of further falls and assessed as such. Those who have had a single, non-injurious fall 
are categorised as low-risk. Due to high numbers, it may not be possible for all high-risk fallers 
to be seen in a falls service, in which case the second criteria should be modified to include 
only those presenting with an injury as the result of a fall. People with non-hip fractures are 
half as likely as people with hip fracture to be referred to falls service, despite being at high 
risk of future fracture and falls. 

Assessment of high-risk fallers 

Most older people with falls have more than one risk factor for falling. Consequently, high-risk 
fallers should receive a multi-factorial assessment for falls risk factors, with intervention 
tailored to modify the identified risks. In most cases, this will be performed in a falls clinic, or 
community-based falls service. Most fallers will not require admission, so urgent care services 
must have robust pathways for identification and referral of fallers. The further assessment 
and management of falls risk factors should be based on NICE Clinical Guideline 2192 or the 
AGS/BGS Guideline91. Falls are particularly common in people with dementia, so a collateral or 
witness history should be obtained wherever possible. Up to 20% of falls are thought to be due 
to transient loss of consciousness. This should be specifically considered and further 
management should follow NICE Clinical Guideline 109 (Transient loss of consciousness in 
adults and young people)93. There may be amnesia for syncope, so this should be suspected 
whenever a person cannot clearly recall the impact on the ground or floor. An ECG should be 
recorded and analysed on any faller where loss of consciousness cannot be excluded. In 
addition, a cardiac examination should specifically look for murmurs and there should be a 
record of the individual’s lying and standing blood pressure. These examinations can be 
performed by any appropriately-trained member of the multi-professional team. All high-risk 
fallers should receive a review of medication, with particular regard for sedative, psychotropic, 
hypotensive or anti-cholinergic medication. Withdrawal of psychotropic medication, in 
particular, can reduce falls risk94. All high-risk fallers should have an assessment of mobility, 
gait, balance and function, including activities of daily living, as well as any perceived 
impairment in relation to falls or the fear of falling. An assessment of the home environment 
will often be appropriate95. 

Assessment of low-risk fallers 

A single fall could be the first sign of difficulties with walking and/or balance and provides an 
opportunity for early intervention. Most older people who fall have an underlying 
musculoskeletal reason for falling. Therefore, all older people reporting a single fall should 
undergo a simple assessment of gait and balance in the acute setting. There are many tools 
for assessing gait and balance, none of which are sufficiently sensitive or specific to allow 
recommendation as the ‘best’ test for predicting falls risk. Simple tools include the Timed Up 
and Go Test96. An older person who has had a single non-injurious fall and who has normal 
gait and balance (normal Up and Go Test) does not require further assessment or intervention. 
Fallers with abnormal gait and balance should be treated as high-risk.

Fragility fractures are a common emergency presentation, the most devastating of which is hip 
fracture. Hip fracture usually requires an admission to hospital for on-going management, but 
other fractures present an opportunity to identify and manage osteoporosis at an early stage 
though the establishment of fracture liaison services. People presenting with a fragility fracture 
should be referred to local falls prevention services.

http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG124 

Polypharmacy is often one of the main causes of emergency admissions. Adverse Drug Events 
account for approximately 6.5% of all hospital admissions97, but more in older people, leading 
to increased hospital stay and significant morbidity and mortality8 98. 

Inappropriate prescribing is a common and serious problem in older people. Inappropriate 
prescribing includes prescribing drugs that are contra-indicated, over-prescribing a drug 
(inappropriate dose or duration), prescribing a drug which is likely to decrease the individual’s 
prognosis, or failure to use a drug  that may improve outcomes99. 

Inappropriate prescribing is more common in older, as compared to younger, older people100-

103. Potential reasons for inappropriate prescribing in older people are related to the higher 
prevalence of chronic diseases and polypharmacy, which render prescribing more complex104 

105. Older people are more susceptible to Adverse Drug Events (ADEs), due to age-related 
physiological changes, such as reduced hepatic and renal function and lower Body Mass Index 
(BMI), which result in altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics106. In addition, the 
relative under-representation of older people in drug trials means that many potential ADEs 
are only detected during post-marketing surveillance of a drug107, and recognition of ADEs in 
older people is complicated by non-specific clinical presentations108.  

Various guidelines have been developed to help reduce potentially inappropriate prescriptions 
amongst older people104 109, although there is no internationally agreed standard110. The 
STOPP/START criteria (Screening Tool of Older Persons potentially inappropriate 
Prescriptions/Screening Tool to Alert doctors to the Right Treatment) have been developed and 
validated9 110, and early results from a small RCT suggest these criteria may be beneficial111. 

Key points 

• Community pharmacists should be empowered to deliver more comprehensive Medicines 
Use Reviews/ Clinical Medication Reviews that are considered and actioned by GPs and 
other prescribers. To encourage the development of more pharmacists as independent 
prescribers would help with this goal 

• Secondary and primary care organisations should offer a structured compliance 
assessment and medicines support service to those older people that have been identified 
as needing increased support with their medication (e.g. compliance devices, follow-up 
medication reviews in community) 

The NCEPOD report into the care of older people undergoing surgery112 found that: 

• 38% received good care 

• 44% had room for improvement in either clinical or organisational care; 13% in both 

• 6% received care that was less than satisfactory 

The National Falls & Bone Health Audit (2010) revealed that: 

• Only 30% of people with hip fracture received good basic urgent care (adequate pain relief 
in the first hour, pressure area care in the first four hours, and intravenous fluids in the 
first twelve hours) 

• Only 22% met the core best practice tariff (BPT) standards (surgery within 36 hours, 
specialist geriatric assessment within 72 hours, and use of an agreed care pathway) 

• 26% received all components of a basic pre-operative medical assessment. 

The report from the NCEPOD includes the following recommendations: 

• Routine input from geriatricians should be available to older people undergoing surgery  

• Delays in surgery for older people are associated with poor outcome 

• Pain is the 5th vital sign, and requires the same status as heart rate and blood pressure in 
assessment and management  

Given the frequent presence of complex co-morbidities in these individuals and their degree of 
need, early assessment and resuscitation should commence and continue in the ambulance 
and emergency departments. Rapid access to geriatricians, anaesthetists, intensivists and 
surgeons is essential to develop early plan of intervention and provide targeted management 
of existing co-morbidities to decrease intra-operative and post-operative complications. Early 
senior decision making is also essential to provide the appropriate palliative care for people 
who are dying who would not benefit from invasive management. The Royal College of 
Anaesthetists has set up a multi-disciplinary Short-Life Working Party to draft a response to 
the NCEPOD Report which will be available in 2012. 

Pain 

The use of traditional pain scales can be difficult because of communication barriers, such as 
cognitive impairment, alternative assessment processes that rely on non-verbal cues may be 
more useful in some older people. Pain management in people with dementia may be 
challenging because of comorbidities but also because of polypharmacy. One of the main 
reasons for such poor levels of analgesia is lack of recognition particularly in the non-verbal 
individual. To address this, consideration should be given to the use of alternative Pain 
Assessment tools such as the Abbey Pain Tool which is particularly suitable for use in the 
urgent care setting. The importance of assessing changes in the individual’s normal behaviour 
patterns as an indicator of increasing stress levels or potential pain cannot be underestimated. 
This can be difficult to do in emergency settings as nurses are often unfamiliar with the person 
and their normal behaviour. The modified Abbey pain scale has a strong emphasis on involving 
the person’s carers/family and includes a section on their perception of pain in their loved one 
as well as highlighting ‘triggers’ to aid staff recognition.

Possible urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common presenting problems or initial diagnosis in 
the ED, however, the diagnosis of UTI is frequently overestimated, especially in care home 
residents114, and frail older people more generally.  

Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated and symptomatic enquiry should therefore 
guide diagnosis. In people with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS), the absence of 
leucocytes and nitrites on the urine dip has the highest negative likelihood ratio to rule out 
UTI. 

Bedside tests are useful only as an adjunct to clinical diagnosis. Visual inspection of urine has a 
90.4% sensitivity but only a 66.4% specificity for bacteriuria, is dependent upon the 
experience of the observer and is not, therefore, a useful test115. Dipstick tests, meanwhile, 
are frequently positive for leucocytes due to the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria 
in frail older people. A dipstick positive for leucocytes and nitrites has a disappointingly low 
positive predictive value of 44%116, and should only be considered in individuals with 
unexplained systemic sepsis117.  Dipstick tests can also miss UTI as a consequence of the fact 
that  some organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus or Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, do not express bacterial nitrate reductase118 and are therefore of limited value. 
Men have a high incidence of UTI secondary to organisms which may not form nitrites and 
should have urine sent for culture if they have symptoms of UTI, regardless of dipstick 
result115.  Dipstick tests should not be performed in older people with long-term catheters as 
constant bacteriuria and pyuria means that the test is not useful.A suggested approach to the 
diagnosis of UTI in older people is shown in Table.

The incidence of under nutrition amongst people admitted to hospitals in UK is 23% on those 
aged less than 65 years but 32% for those aged 65+119. Under nutrition is poorly detected by 
nursing and medical staff. The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) developed by the 
Malnutrition Advisory Group of BAPEN is commonly used in UK although locally devised tools 
are in use in many hospitals. 

The importance of creating the right environment to support eating and drinking has been 
highlighted through key policy initiatives. The Essence of Care Benchmark on nutrition is a 
patient-focused approach and can provide organisations with an auditable standard upon which 
to base practice. Every hospital should implement the seven steps to end malnutrition in 
hospital as recommended by the Age Concern Hungry to be Heard report: 

• Hospital staff must listen to older people, their relatives and carers and act on what they 
say 

• Staff must become ‘food aware’ 

• Hospital staff must follow their own professional codes and guidance from other bodies  

• Older people must be assessed for signs or danger of malnutrition on admission and at 
regular intervals during their stay 

• Hospital should introduce a ‘red tray’ system to help those who need assistance in feeding 
and ensure it works in practice

It is estimated that just under half a million people in the UK will develop at least one pressure 
ulcer in any given year. This is usually people with an underlying health condition. For 
example, around 1 in 20 people who are admitted to hospital with an acute illness will develop 
a pressure ulcer. 

• ageing of the skin  

• older people having a higher rate of mobility problems 

(taken from http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pressure-ulcers/Pages/Introduction.aspx) 

Prevention is key and older people accessing urgent care should be routinely screened for their 
risk of developing pressure sores, for example using the Waterlow score. Important measures 
that can prevent the development of pressure sores include: 

• Mobilisation 

• Good nutrition 

• Appropriate mattresses and cushions 

• Appropriate skin care 

For further information see: 

RCN Pressure Ulcer Risk Assessment and Prevention. Royal College of Nursing:

A patient safety focused approach is an essential underlying principle for the safe assessment 
of any person accessing urgent care; part of this approach is to identify any injuries that need 
attention. 

Older people presenting with poly-trauma need to be managed according to Advanced Trauma 
and Life Support (ATLS) principles with special consideration of the fact they do not respond 
well to prolonged immobilisation and balanced resuscitation. Advanced imaging including early 
CT scanning is important for quicker and definitive diagnosis, and as an adjunct to clinical 
assessment in prompt decision making, adequate management and efficient disposal. However 
use of contrast enhanced scans requires careful deliberation to strike the right balance of risk 
between identifying life threatening injuries and precipitating renal failure. 

There is an association between increasing age and poor outcome following trauma, although 
any individual factor or combinations fail to predict an unacceptable outcome. Hence it is 
usually advisable to embark on aggressive therapy irrespective of age or injury, except in the 
initially moribund individual. Older people who do not respond to this initial resuscitation have 
adverse outcomes. The responders have a good prognosis including a complete return to their 
pre-morbid state120. 

End of life care 

In the United Kingdom, there has been a concerted policy drive to try and reduce deaths in 
hospital, underpinned by the belief that many deaths can be anticipated, and that dignity and 
quality of life is best served by a death at home – a concept supported by the public121 122. But 
in frail older people, especially those with dementia, end of life care needs remain somewhat 
neglected, and over-investigation and inappropriate interventions remain a costly exercise for 
both patients and the health and social care economy123. Advance Care Planning (ACP) is one 
proposed mechanism by which individuals’ wishes and preferences may be better respected, 
especially in end of life care where the loss of decision making ability is common. Policy and 
guidelines promote the use of ACP with varying levels of caution124 125.

Early in the context of a crisis, a senior clinician should be in a position to have a discussion 
with the individual, and any other concerned parties such as next of kin or carers, about 
resuscitation – if appropriate to do so. This may avoid inappropriate escalation of care for 
some older people. It may also prompt the involvement of palliative care in certain situations. 
Such a discussion may need to take place much earlier within the resuscitation setting of an 
emergency department to avoid unnecessary life-prolonging interventions where the outcome 
may not useful or desirable. It is good practice to enquire about advance care plans, or more 
informal expressions of preferences early on in the individual’s stay126.

Frail older people may be especially vulnerable and will often require a holistic assessment of 
their home circumstances before discharge. Taking a broad perspective on the safety of a 
discharge home, or to any other stetting will enhance person satisfaction and reduce the risk 
of readmissions, and ultimately the need for long term care. To facilitate more detailed 
assessment in selected older people, the emergency department will need to have timely 
access to therapy staff and social services support. Many older people will have on-going 
health issues that need to be addressed, although not necessarily requiring a hospital 
admission. For such people, timely access to ambulatory care services, such as a rapid access 
falls clinic, can facilitate early discharge from the ED. The person’s GP will be key to support in 
the community, so accurate communication to the GP is important. As the emergency 
department is part of a wider community serving older people, it will need to know about 
relevant services, and will need to be able to contact them in a timely manner to coordinate 
discharge planning. 

The use of validated ED assessment tools such as Identification of Seniors At Risk (ISAR) tool 
should be considered to identify older persons at risk for mortality, functional decline, 
readmission and institutionalisation on discharge (Appendix 3). 

Living with one of more long term conditions can be stressful for older people and their 
informal carers, who may also have multiple health conditions and require support in their 
caring role. Carers should be informed of their entitlement to a carers assessment to identify 
how they may be supported in their caring role. Condition-specific national support 
organisations can provide information and advice for people living with a particular condition 
and the chance to share problems and ideas in a web-based discussion forum. Many also have 
local groups that offer the chance for individuals and their carers to meet, share experiences 
and support each other in a relaxed and social environment 

• Older people presenting to emergency services should be assessed and managed promptly 
with special consideration of their physical, emotional and cognitive states and with 
reference to privacy, dignity, socio-cultural and religious issues. 

• The extent of this holistic assessment within a bio-psychosocial model will depend on the 
acuity of the presentation and some of it may not be possible based on timely individual 
needs 

• The ED and AMU are well placed for opportunistic case finding as by virtue of their 
interface position; many people with falls52 127 and cognitive impairment may present for 
the first time to the ED/AMU 

• It may be difficult to deliver comprehensive geriatric assessment outside inpatient wards 
or outpatients, but the process could be contributed to, and indeed, triggered from an 
urgent care episode attendance 

• Frail older people often present with complex medical problems and early engagement and 
‘in-reach’ from geriatric and psychogeriatric teams is essential 

• Effective teams often work in an interdisciplinary way improving communication and 
relationship 

• If a person requires an acute admission to hospital, planning for discharge or transfer of 
care should begin as soon as possible60, operationalised as the setting of an Estimated 
Date of Discharge (EDD)46 128. 

The Environment 

Older people need to be cared for in environments that have a positive impact on physical and 
mental well-being including being nursed for in single-sex accommodation with adequate 
natural lighting and respect for privacy and dignity.

The impact of global climate change with more resultant storms, floods and heatwaves in 
England in future, could have serious effects on the services, buildings, and communication 
routes that support the delivery of health and social care for older people. This is the subject of 
a current research project: 

http://www.dur.ac.uk/geography/research/researchprojects/biopiccc/background/ 

Context 

Abuse of older people is common129 130. It may occur in many settings: private homes, care 
homes and hospitals (including Emergency Departments). Safeguarding is a range of activity 
aimed at upholding an adult’s fundamental right to be safe. It is of particular importance for 
people who, because of their situation or circumstances, are unable to keep themselves safe. 
The Mental Capacity Act 131 132introduced a new criminal offence of or wilfully neglecting a 
person without capacity. The nature of abuse and the fact that it is commonplace makes it 
critical that it is clearly understood that recognising and tackling abuse is everyone’s 
responsibility. Studies from around the world suggest that one in four vulnerable older people 
are at risk of abuse, however only a small proportion of this is currently detected. In the UK of 
a sample of people aged 66 or over living in private households between 2.6% and 4% of 
respondents reported that they had experienced “mistreatment” by a family member, close 
friend or care worker during the previous year130. This equates to a figure of between 227,000 
and 342,000 people aged 66 or across the UK. 

Nature of abuse 

Five types of abuse are recognised: 

1. Physical abuse, including hitting, slapping, pushing, kicking, misuse of medication, restraint, 
or inappropriate sanctions  

2. Psychological abuse, including emotional abuse, threats of harm or abandonment, 
deprivation of contact, humiliation, blaming, controlling, intimidation, coercion, harassment, 
verbal abuse, isolation or withdrawal from services or supportive networks 

3. Financial or material abuse, including theft, fraud, exploitation, pressure in connection with 
wills, property or inheritance or financial transactions, or the misuse or misappropriation of 
property, possessions or benefits  

4. Sexual abuse, including rape and sexual assault or sexual acts to which the vulnerable adult 
has not consented, or could not consent or was pressured into consenting  

5. Neglect and acts of omission, including ignoring medical or physical care needs, failure to 
provide access to appropriate health, social care or educational services, the withholding of 
the necessities of life, such as medication, adequate nutrition and heating  

Assessment and assessment tools 

Action on Elder Abuse has produced the guidance on recognising abuse:

See Appendix 7 for more information. 

Key points 

• All EDs have arrangements with local social services, police and other agencies about how 
to notify concerns about the abuse of vulnerable people. 

• All EDs understand the role of Safeguarding of Adults Boards and have training to ensure 
all clinicians and others working with older people, not only know what safeguarding is and 
what abuse looks like, but are clear what to do about it and who is responsible for what 

Context 

High quality management of frail older people is challenging because they often present non-
specifically (for example with falls, immobility, delirium) which can make the immediate 
diagnosis obscure. 

Training of all health care professional and providers has not traditionally focused on the needs 
of older people, thus there is a lack of confidence and expertise in managing older people and 
conditions associated with ageing. Junior doctors are usually the ‘first receivers’ at the front 
door (emergency department or acute medical unit), and few will have any substantial training 
in geriatric medicine and the formulation of the non-specific presentation. This may be in part 
due to the possible decline in the teaching of geriatric medicine in UK medical schools23 133.  

Aside from the knowledge of frailty syndromes, there is a skill involved in geriatric medicine – 
history taking is challenging, for example because of sensory impairment, dementia or 
delirium. Often a collateral history is needed which may not be readily accessible in the 
emergency setting and time pressures, not least the four hour emergency care standard, may 
place pressure on staff not to focus on anything other than immediate triage – thereby 
undermining the EDs ability to undertaken immediate clinical evaluation and management t 
address the individual’s needs. 

A positive attitude to managing frail older people is a pre-requisite for implementing the 
appropriate knowledge and skills; health care professionals’ attitudes towards frail older people 
could be better, and ageism remains a problem in the health system24-26. 

It follows that because the nature of the assessment and care for older people is multi- 
disciplinary, the principles of joint training for all professionals should be considered where 
appropriate. 

Skills and competencies 

Generic 

• Communication skills, often under challenging conditions e.g. to take a detailed history 
from the person, ability to explain things in more than one way, give encouragement 

• Listening skills 

• Compassion, empathy and respect  

• Clinical reasoning and assessment skills 

• Time/patience and the ability to build a rapport/relationship quickly 

• Awareness of community services 

• Risk assessment/management skills surrounding discharge planning 

• Multidisciplinary team working skills 

• Personal care training skills 

• Moving and handling skills 

• Basic life support skills 

• Ability to balance contrasting needs of a complex individual 

Additional training and development of staff in managing frail older people 

Comprehensive training of staff managing care of older people in the emergency settings is 
paramount to safe and effective delivery of care. This should not be restricted to medical staff, 
but all health care agencies, social services and community teams involved in older peoples’ 
care. Where ever possible and appropriate, this training should be undertaken jointly. 

Medical staff 

Doctors in training follow a defined curriculum dependent on their grade and specialism, with 
defined learning objectives as outlined in their learning portfolio, knowledge skills and work 
based assessments through a competency based curriculum approved by the General Medical 
Council and the guidance provided in the Gold Guide. Senior staff should regularly update their 
skills in aspects of care of older people134. Training of nurses, doctors and allied health 
professionalsshould include skills, knowledge and attitudes in relation to: 

• Assessments, particularly mental state, cognitive assessments and functional ability 

• Updated clinical practice guidelines 

• Local operational policies on assessment and management of the older person 

Background in Emergency Medicine 

• Post-registration modules for emergency care doctors, nurses and allied health 
professionals should include sessions on the needs of the older person accessing 
emergency care which includes the aging process, dementia, delirium, falls and frailty  

• Emergency Nurse Practitioner/Advanced Nurse Practitioner/Advanced Clinical 
Practitioner/Physician Assistant/Consultant Allied Health Professional awards should also 
include the content outlined above; this is especially important as they may be the only 
clinician to assess, plan and implement care for the older person 

• Clinical advocates for the older person in emergency care should provide clinical updates 
to ED staff as and when necessary, e.g. following the publication of relevant guidelines. 

• There should be an emergency care network of such clinical advocates in order to share 
information and develop new initiatives 

• Universities and Emergency Departments should consider asking older service users to 
provide input to any education and training provided 

Background in geriatric medicine 

Geriatricians should be well trained in the clinical assessment and management of frail older 
people, but may be unfamiliar with the specific challenges of working within an emergency 
department. 

Areas that may need additional training include: 

• System based risk assessment 

• Handover and communication in a full-shift system 

• Structured assessment of older people with trauma including hip fractures, head injury and 
poly trauma 

For trainees in Acute Medicine the curriculum recommends that in the ST4 or ST5 year there 
should be at least four months experience of acute geriatric care. Within the specialist skill 
section of the acute internal medicine curriculum is the opportunity for acute medicine trainees 
to gain extra competencies in more specialised areas. Trainees have to achieve competences 
that are prescribed by the relevant supervising authorities and among these specialties, and 
directly relevant to care of frail older people, are stroke medicine and palliative care.

The recent Health Service Ombudsman’s2 report tells the stories of  ten people over the age of 
65, from all walks of life and from across England. Friends and families described them 
variously as loving partners, parents and grandparents. Many of them were people with energy 
and vitality, active in their retirement and well known and liked within their communities. They 
had in common experiences of suffering unnecessary pain, indignity and distress while in the 
care of the NHS. Poor care or badly managed medication contributed to their deteriorating 
health, as they were transformed from alert and able individuals to people who were 
dehydrated, malnourished or unable to communicate. As one relative reported: ‘Our dad was 
not treated as a capable man in ill-health, but as someone whom staff could not have cared 
less whether he lived or died’. 

People attending the emergency department come with a multitude of nursing care needs 
ranging from minor injuries and illness through to life threatening conditions. In addition to 
physical needs, the person has psychological, social and emotional needs that can often 
require highly skilled nursing interventions. Often, relatives and friends of older people may 
also have needs whilst attending Urgent Care Services. Nurses provide continuity to all aspects 
of care; it is essential that the quality of nursing care should be of the highest standards. 

The Essence of Care136 benchmarks launched by the Department of Health in 2010 include 
bladder, bowel & continence care, nutrition, prevention and management of pain, personal 
hygiene, pressure ulcer prevention and care, respect and dignity, safety and communication. 
The Royal College of Nursing recently launched the Principles of Nursing Practice (2010). 
Developed in partnership with patient and user organisations; the Department of Health (DH) 
and The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), they describe what people and service users 
can expect from nursing services (in any setting) and from those providing their nursing care - 
be it from a Registrant, Health Care Assistant, or a Nursing Student.  

The Principles underpin practice with peoples’ expectations and rights to be autonomous, 
treated equally and fairly and treated with dignity and respect. To put it simply, the Principles 
of Nursing Practice describe what everyone can expect from nursing.

Within the acute geriatric setting, physiotherapists should have all the general skills expected 
in terms of communication and clinical reasoning together with an understanding of the 
hospital organisation and community services available. Therapists would be expected to have 
advanced skills in risk assessment and assessment of mental capacity and common 
presentations in older people such as falls, delirium, dementia, malnutrition, fragility fractures 
etc. Due to the nature of the acute assessment, including home visits, physiotherapists will 
often be working alone and as such they will need to be competent and confident in making 
safe and effective decisions with the individual. Knowledge of the complexity of health and 
social needs and an ability to constructively liaise with other professions and agencies to meet 
the needs of the individual is essential. Physiotherapists often work alongside occupational 
therapists, and other health care professionals, triaging older people in an urgent care 
situation or at the emergency department.   

Therapists need to demonstrate their own professional development and may be asked to 
present this to the Health Professions Council if requested. Advanced courses are available to 
physiotherapists choosing to specialise in geriatrics and acute healthcare.

Occupational therapy 

Undergraduate occupational therapy training gives a sound basis for working with frail older 
people. Many older people attend emergency departments with medical problems which affect 
their ability to carry out their usual activities of daily living, such as using the toilet or getting 
in and out of bed137-139. In some cases this results in older people staying in hospital for longer 
than their medical condition alone would require. This can be detrimental to older peoples’ 
recovery by increasing their dependence and delaying their transfer back to the community but 
also results in additional health care costs whilst they receive rehabilitation or arrangements 
for support at home. 

Recognising the complex needs of older adults attending ED many hospitals now employ 
occupational therapists to work in the ED. Occupational therapists are able to provide 
assessment for functional and social needs and provide the equipment and support 
required, thus preventing unnecessary admissions for older people. 

The added expertise and involvement of occupational therapists in reablement teams 
contribute to successful reablement services as they have extensive knowledge and 
understanding of the equipment and adaptations that are a major part of reablement

Pre-Hospital Care 

Historically Ambulance Services have used the Institute of Healthcare Development’s (IHCD) 
vocational educational programme to develop and educate their staff using a skills escalator 
approach142. Recently ambulance services have moved to the Higher Education (HE) route 
following the publication of programme and curriculum recommendations by the Joint Royal 
Colleges Service Liaison Committee (JRCALC)143, the requirements of the Health Professions 
Council UK144 and the involvement of the College of Paramedics145.  

The curriculum for the paramedic education programme does not have a specific module on 
geriatric medicine. However, the competencies needed for assessing and managing frail older 
people, which covers the psychosocial context and working within a wider healthcare team, are 
addressed in different modules. There is also a focus on the attitudinal aspects of care, 
communication barriers and techniques, assessment of capacity, as well as training in ethics 
and law, with reference to advance decisions and advance care planning. 

There is scope for delivering a more specialist programme in geriatric medicine for ambulance 
clinicians, which would both consolidate the knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to deliver 
best practice in this population group, as well as highlight the importance of this specialty in an 
ageing population, where frail older people represent a large proportion of acute admissions to 
hospital. 

Numerous factors need to be considered when planning major incident and disaster 
preparedness. Frail older people, those with serious physical, cognitive, economic, and psycho-
social problems, are at especially high risk146. 

The vulnerability of older people to disasters and in any major incident situation in whatever 
setting is related to their impaired physical mobility, diminished sensory awareness, chronic 
health conditions, and social and economic limitations that hinder their alacrity and 
adaptability in a major incident or emergency situation. In the UK whilst the number of older 
people who have been immediate casualties in a major incident is low there is a significant 
challenge in evacuating emergency departments in order to receive new casualties, particularly 
when the older people to be evacuated have impaired cognitive function and mobility 
problems. In recent years extremes of weather have caused a number of natural disasters 
such as flooding and heat waves which have resulted in significant rises in ED attendances and 
in many cases deaths147 148. Natural disasters may be relatively rare but the impact can be 
devastating and far reaching. It is notable that of the 1,330 people known to have perished in 
Hurricane Katrina in America in 2005, 71% were over the age of 60 and 47% were older than 
75 years and at least 68 people died in nursing homes. Whilst such extreme natural disasters 
are unlikely in the UK, a fire in a residential home would pose significant challenges for the 
emergency services in the community as well as in the hospital setting. Making specific 
provision for the vulnerable in Major Incident plans is not only prudent but essential to 
preserve life. 

The importance of data in the care of older people 

The emergency care workload has increased over the years and the percentage of older people 
presenting has increased, but this increase in complexity has been poorly documented in the 
UK. Unfortunately, without data to demonstrate good quality and/or gaps in service provision, 
it is impossible to plan or run medical services effectively: UK Emergency Care has been highly 
deficient in this regard. Good quality diagnostic data about older people presentation, 
diagnosis and treatment is vital to inform service provision, audit and research.  

Diagnostic data should be collected in a standardised format e.g. the CEM Unified Diagnostic 
DAtaset (UDDA) (http://secure.collemergencymed.ac.uk/Shop-
Floor/Informatics/CEM%20Unified%20Diagnostic%20Dataset%20(UDDA)/). 

Older people attending for urgent care may not be able to communicate details about their 
health, social care and wishes for treatment which may be recorded in mental health trust and 
social services records. 

Emergency Department Information Systems should have the ability to exchange data about 
older people with other systems, especially primary care as this reduces the risk of prescribing 
errors. 

It is essential to share adequate and appropriate information between services to facilitate 
health and social care management and address safeguarding issues.  

A minimum dataset, such as a Summary Care Record, will facilitate such information gathering 
and sharing. 

This needs to include certain essentials: 

• Demographic details including next of kin 

• Special needs requirements – medical and social 

• Communication of medical and social situation including treatment history and results of 
recent salient investigations 

• Results of recent diagnostic tests including copies of ECGs 

• Advance decisions to refuse treatment 

• Proxy decision makers – attorneys, deputies, guardians etc. This information can be 
obtained from the Offices of the Public Guardians   

Such information may be made available as ‘Patient held record’ as in hand-held files in care 
home residents that include copies of MARR sheets and are updated after important 
interventions. 

Data integration is also significant for analysis and commissioning at an aggregated level. 

Information sharing and making best use of shared intelligence across the whole health and 
social care system available from multiple sources will enhance and support good decision 
making. Developments such as datasets may help define activity and casemix more specifically 
although the critical challenge of coding frailty remains to be solved.

Clinical governance 

Guidelines are important for quality improvement, but will be ineffective unless supported by 
change management techniques and clinical champions. 

Clinical audit is another key component of quality improvement. It provides a review of 
existing practice or performance against standards, ideally from evidence-based or expert-
derived guidelines. Areas for improvement are then identified before changes are 
recommended and, hopefully, implemented. Further audit cycles can demonstrate both where 
improvements have been made and where work is still needed. There is good evidence that 
repeated audit, local or national, can lead to progressive and sustained improvements in 
clinical care and older people outcome. 

Audit may be periodic or continuous, depending on the nature of the condition or process being 
measured, and the level of detail required. Periodic audit, i.e. audits where each cycle is 
separated in time from the next, are the most common type. For example, the National 
Sentinel Stroke Audit has competed 7 detailed cycles of audit over more than a decade and 
has seen the universal introduction of stroke units, amongst many improvements. Continuous 
audits, such as the National Hip Fracture Database, collect relatively small amounts of 
information on all older people, providing near-real time data, benchmarked against other 
hospitals. This has proved a powerful lever for change for better hip fracture services in many 
hospitals. Locally, a continuous audit could collect daily data on time to first analgesia, 
reported back to the clinical team on a weekly basis. This would rapidly lead to reductions in 
delays in older people receiving pain relief.  

The National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme is funded centrally by the 
Department of Health and administered by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership 
(HQIP). It currently includes the following national audits relevant to the urgent care of older 
people: 

• Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) 

• National Audit of Falls and Bone Health in Older People (NAFBH) 

• National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) 

• National Audit of Continence Care 

• Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) 

In addition, there is the Stroke Improvement National Audit Programme (SINAP), which is a 
continuous audit of acute stroke treatment, including thrombolysis, and outcome. From 2012, 
the NHFD and NAFBH will be combined in a new falls and fragility fracture audit programme. It 
is hoped that one or more new national audits, relevant to other aspects of emergency care of 
older people, will be commissioned following the publication of this report. 

It is recommended that providers of urgent care introduce regular local audit of the emergency 
care and outcomes of older people. The key audit standards, as recommended in this report, 
are detailed below.

Whole system metrics 

Health and social care systems may wish to analyse the following metrics, which should 
describe the system’s performance about older peoples’ care: 

• Proportion of urgent care encounters in primary care leading to a hospital attendance and 
separately hospital admission in people aged 65+/75+/85+ 

• ED attendance and re-attendance rate per 1000 population of 65+/75+/85+ 

• Emergency department conversion rate for people aged 65+/75+/85+ per 1000  

• Hospital readmission rates for people aged 65+/75+/85+ and ED re-attendance rate for 
same group 

• Rates of long term care use at 90 days post-discharge following ED attendance and 
discharge from hospital for people aged 65+/75+/85+ 

• Mortality rate per 1000 in the 65+/75+ and 85+ 

• Patient and/or carer satisfaction survey 

Research in geriatric emergency care 

There is an embarrassing paucity of research into the needs of frail older people in general, 
and hardly any directly relevant research addressing urgent care. The reasons for this 
mismatch in research versus population needs are partly historical, but also related to some of 
the difficulties in recruiting frail older people into research studies. Possible barriers include 
individual reluctance, and fears of being a ‘guinea pig’, difficulties recruiting people without 
capacity and the challenges of loss to follow up in a population with inherently high rates of 
mortality. There is the additional complexity and challenge of conducting service related 
research (e.g. testing a new unit or multidisciplinary team) in contrast to condition specific 
research (e.g. aspirin in stroke) where human factors may be multiple and funding bodies are 
generally more cautious. None of these barriers are insurmountable – for example, greater 
public awareness about research can change perceptions, recent developments in ethical 
regulations and the Mental Capacity Act have clarified the procedures to recruit people without 
capacity131, and newer outcome measures are being developed that address the issues of loss 
to follow up149. 

Changes in national research funding mechanism, specifically the introduction of research 
funding streams such as the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) ‘Research for Patient 
Benefit’ and ‘Programme Grants for Applied Research’ have increased the amount of funding 
available to deliver high quality research that has direct relevance to the needs of the NHS. 
Notably, recent NIHR calls have focussed on dementia, a hitherto much neglected are of 
research. The challenge for the research community interested in frail older people is to 
develop sufficient expertise, quality and critical mass to take advantage of the research 
infrastructure now in place. Given the dearth of research on the urgent care needs of frail older 
people, there is considerable scope to develop a substantial body of work addressing this 
issue. This is likely to need to start with developing an in-depth understanding of the issues, 
from the person, carer, professional and system perspective. Once this is achieved, then there 
is a need for high quality randomised studies that test different models and systems of care, 
which must also include measures of cost-effectiveness.  

Chapter 10 Commissioning urgent and emergency care for older people 

Commissioning urgent and emergency care services for older people merits a strategic 
approach which is: 

• needs led based on local prevalence of health and social care related issues 

• commissioner led   

• developed in conjunction with providers based on locally available resources 

• supporting innovation while delivering evidence based intervention 

• focus on improving clinical outcomes through “service integration” between primary and 
secondary care and health and social care 

Service planning and delivery needs to strategically align Emergency Physicians, Geriatricians, 
General Practitioners and social care with multidisciplinary teams in hospital and in the 
community together with timely information to deliver these outcomes from the moment that 
an older person presents to the Emergency Department. The combination not only provides 
the optimal blend of expertise to provide the right clinical risk assessment and management 
for the older person who attends the Emergency Department but also to develop systems to 
reduce the need for these and other older people attending in the future. 

Commissioning evidence based integrated health and social care systems that address care 
across the continuum will help deliver safe, efficient, effective and a high quality care for frail 
older people in the years to come.

Appendix 1 Sample business case for an emergency frailty unit – Leicester 
Leicestershire & Rutland 

Aims and Objectives 

The aim of this project is to improve care for frail older people throughout Leicester, 
Leicestershire and Rutland (LLR), by delivering Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment for frail 
older people at the time of a medical crisis. The objectives are: 

• 
To establish a team of ‘interface geriatricians’ who will actively manage frail older 
people at the ‘front door’ and in the community around the time of a medical crisis 

• 
Improved seamless, efficient, and effective care for frail older people, measured by 
death rates, hospital admission and re-admissions rates, and person satisfaction 

Proposal – the intervention 

To establish a team of interface geriatricians, whose role will be to assess and manage frail 
older people attending the Emergency department (ED) or the Acute Medical Unit (AMU) at the 
Leicester Royal Infirmary. The role of the interface geriatricians will to deliver specialist 
geriatric assessment at the key interfaces between acute and community care, namely the 
emergency department (including the emergency decisions unit), and the acute medical unit. 
The posts could be extended to cover community hospitals and intermediate care services, 
with the initial contact in the urgent care setting being followed up if necessary in the 
community setting, either by means of a clinic appointment of home visit. The geriatric 
assessment will be in addition to current services, which include a multidisciplinary assessment 
and access to community matrons. 

Ultimately the new ‘interface geriatrician’ will have acute and community responsibilities and 
will be locality based, ensuring that they get to know and be known by already established 
teams. There will be a greater reliance on personal communication between practitioners 
rather than policies and protocols. The vision is that it will be easy and natural for a primary 
care professional to pick up the phone and discuss a person rather than arrange an emergency 
admission. Urgent referrals can be seen on the same day in the emergency frailty unit, but 
those that are more stable can be seen on the next day in the community sessions. 

The impact of the interface geriatrician will be on both UHL and PCTs – by reducing 
inappropriate admissions to hospital through front door assessments and community 
assessments (cost saving for PCT) and also by providing efficiency savings within UHL (earlier, 
rapid coordinated discharges from acute settings). Pilot data suggest that up to 25% of frail 
older people could be safely and appropriately turned around within the Emergency 
Department or the acute medical unit – so avoiding hospital admissions for some and reducing 
the length of stay for others. The impact of specialist geriatric care on the AMU has been a 
doubling of discharge rates without any increase in 30 or 90 day readmission rates for complex 
older people. 

To achieve this we will need to ensure the existing geriatric team can support the service 
initially in ED whilst reviewing other medical appointments in order to prioritise the use of 
existing funding.  The longer term plan to ensure roll out into the community would be to work 
to provide a team of: 

• 
4 WTE consultant geriatricians dedicated to support the AFU and ED, with a reciprocal 
role in one community based locality. 

• 
1 WTE secretary to act as a central point of contact and provide administrative support 

In the first instance we are seeking to provide one interface geriatrician to pilot the scheme. 
This is in the context of a pilot utilising existing resource and budgets whilst acknowledging the 
current financial climate. 

There is robust evidence supporting Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) as an 
effective intervention to improve the quality of care for frail older people settings. Benefits 
have been shown in both hospital and community settings, including care homes, in a variety 
of countries. CGA involves a multidisciplinary team, including a specialist geriatric medical 
component, assessing and arranging interventions for patients. When applied successfully, this 
can improve survival and functional ability, and reduce institutionalisation - and we thereby 
infer, improve quality of life. 

CGA reduces hospital admissions and readmissions when applied effectively; local data has 
shown a doubling of appropriate discharges from the AMU. The consequences of unnecessary 
(and often unwanted) hospital admissions for frail older people are significant, and include 
functional decline, increased risk of falls, delirium and other iatrogenic complications, as well 
as an increased risk of institutionalisation. Often, community services (community hospitals or 
intermediate care schemes) providing an appropriate service focusing on rehabilitation have 
better outcomes, increasing the proportion of people retaining their independence, without any 
adverse impact upon satisfaction or carer burden. 

Strategic relevance 

The care of frail older people has changed dramatically over the last 10-15 years. Previously, 
much acute care and the ongoing rehabilitation of older people were delivered in acute hospital 
settings. Now, acute hospital care is over very short time periods, with on-going care and 
rehabilitation being provided in a variety of community settings. These settings include 
intermediate care schemes (home based or residential) and community hospitals.  

Some older patients with complex needs who would previously been managed in hospitals by 
geriatricians, may not receive a specialist geriatric assessment even though they may still 
access other aspects of comprehensive geriatric care (physiotherapy, occupational therapy 
etc).  

The optimal model of care which brings together acute and community geriatric care is not well 
established, but better liaison between acute and community services is one key aspect which 
we are seeking to address in this project. 

The importance of getting care for frail older people right cannot be underestimated; they are 
major users of hospital services and the most rapidly growing proportion of society. Excellence 
in the care of older people is not an option – it is the core business of the NHS. 

Funding 

These estimates are based on UHL data for patients aged 70+ with an HRG code including 99 – 
complex. The estimates are conservative, not least because the service as described would not 
be 24/7, but in mitigation, it is likely that the interface geriatricians would have an impact on a 
wider range of patients than just those coded as HRG 99. For example, 17% of the 150,000 
(25,500) ED attendees each year are aged 65+, and there are 6000 fallers who attend each 
year, many of whom might benefit from geriatric input. 

Supporting evidence for this intervention comes from pilot work already undertaken in the 
Acute Frailty Unit at the LRI. Approximately 1800 frail older people are admitted to the AMU at 
the LRI annually. We anticipate preventing about half of the 20% of unnecessary AMU 
admissions within the emergency department (20% of all complex older patients are 
discharged within 24 hours). 

Only 8% of frail older people were discharged direct from AMU in 2009. 30 day readmission 
rates were 24%, and 90 day readmission rates were 35%. Pilot work on the acute frailty unit 
with limited geriatric input has shown a reduction in 30 day readmission rates from 24% to 
18% (25% relative risk reduction). Additional savings can be anticipated by increasing the 
discharge rate from AMU; this is currently 8%, having increased in 2009 from a historical 5% 
baseline for all complex older patients in AMU. For patients in the AFU, with geriatric input 3 
mornings per week, the discharge rate is 9%; with a more robust team in place, we estimate 
an increase in the discharge rate from all complex older patients across the AMU from 8% to at 

The actual projected savings from this project are based on proposed activity. A geriatrician 
working in the ED should be able to see at least eight frail older patients in a four hour shift - 
two geriatricians would see sixteen over eight hours. Based on the pilot data outlined above, 
approximately 25% should be discharged home who would otherwise have been admitted.

Figure 4 highlights some of the activities in primary care that can promote health and 
potentially reduce crises. This may include for example, Advance Care Planning10 and 
appropriate prescribing (for example using the STOPP/START tool9 99 110 150 151), amongst other 
interventions. However, it acknowledges that crises will occur and that frail older people will 
still need to access urgent care. The ISAR tool152 can be used to identify people at risk of 
adverse outcome being sent home from the Emergency Department, so that they can access 
long term conditions services, such as case managers152-155.

ISAR – Identification of Seniors At Risk tool 

CGA – Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment 

A key component of the model is the presence of geriatricians and MDT in the Emergency 
Department. Whilst a full assessment may not be possible, early appropriate decision making 
may identify more older people who could be managed in the community setting. In order for 
discharge from ED to be safe, there needs to be provision in the community for on-going 
management – hence the locality teams. 

One of the challenges is delivering CGA in acute medical units, with rapid turnover of older 
people and staff. Whilst the evidence base does not generally support liaison services43 156, it 
maybe that in the AMU, such a service is necessary63.

These guidelines are for use when a patient is acutely, and severely, ‘disturbed’, that is, 
physically aggressive, or threatening to become so, a danger to him or herself, staff, visitors or 
other patients, or exhibiting behaviour disruptive to the functioning of the ward, and with a 
presumed medical or psychiatric cause. Consent is generally required for treatment. If the 
patient is not competent to give or refuse consent (see notes 1 and 2), act on your judgement 
of what is in the patient’s best interest.  

Think of the possibility of a treatable medical cause for the disturbance (e.g. hypoglycaemia, 
pain, hypoxia, urinary retention). 

For guidance only – rigid adherence may not be appropriate. Seek more senior advice, at any 
stage, if in doubt. 

ACTION 

1. Use non-drug measures first. Remain calm and do not get angry (it never helps). Avoid 
direct confrontation and provocation. Find out what is worrying the patient and what they want 
done about it. Offer to help. Reassure patient that he or she is not going to be harmed. 
Negotiate a return to room/chair/bed or try distraction (watch TV, have a drink). If necessary, 
use physical restraint - the minimum practicable for the minimum length of time. Call Security 
to assist with restraint if required. 

2. Offer oral medication, preferably in liquid form, HALOPERIDOL 5 mg, or LORAZEPAM 2 mg 
(crush tablets and dissolve in a small volume of water). Halve doses if elderly and frail. 

3. If rapid, parenteral, sedation with drugs is required look at the table. Use your clinical 
judgement to decide what category of patient you are dealing with.  

Get the patient safely restrained. Give first suggested drug intramuscularly. Wait 20-30 
minutes. If no, or inadequate, response give second suggested drug. Repeat these at intervals 
of 20-30 minutes until control is achieved or maximum dose is reached. 

Haloperidol 18mg 

Severe respiratory 
disease 

Haloperidol 10mg 

Haloperidol 18mg 

Nurse in a light, quiet room. Separate from other patients. Nursing observation should be 
appropriate to the level of sedation. Nurse in the recovery position, and continue to observe 
respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. Once awake, offer glasses and hearing aid, if worn. 

A diagnosis for the behavioural disturbance must be made, and the underlying cause treated. 
Consider drugs (including illicit), alcohol, hypoglycaemia, infection, metabolic disturbance, 
acute neurological disease (including trauma, infections, vascular and space-occupying 
lesions), pain, urinary retention, constipation. Urgently get a third party history of previous 
psychiatric problems and previous cognitive function (use the phone; relatives, GP).  

Record the treatment given, and the basis of the decisions taken, in the medical notes. 
Consider the need for starting or increasing regular oral medication before emergency sedation 
wears off. Be wary, however, of regular sedation without a good explanation of what is going 
on medically. Review all sedative drugs daily. 

BE CAREFUL.  READ THE NOTES OVER THE PAGE.  YOU MAY BE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE 
DRUGS USED. 

NOTES 

1. Capacity for consent requires that an adult (18 years of age or over) can understand the 
purpose, nature and effects of the proposed treatment, including adverse effects and the 
consequences of refusal; retain the information; weigh up and make a judgement about it; and 
communicate a decision. Capacity can be lost temporarily for psychological reasons, including 
severe anxiety. An adult who does not have capacity to consent can be given medical 
treatment in an emergency, in their best interests. A parent may consent for a young person 
under 18. If unavailable, in an emergency proceed in the patient’s best interest as for an adult. 

2. Sedation must have therapeutic intent, e.g. to prevent harm to the patient, other patients, 
staff or visitors; to permit the administration of other definitive treatment in the patient’s best 
interest; or to relieve distressing symptoms like psychosis, fear or severe anxiety. If there is 
doubt, consult a senior colleague or a psychiatrist. A section of the Mental Health Act (1983) 
may need to be applied, but do not allow this to delay treatment which is immediately 
necessary. Some conflict situations may be managed best by acceding to the patients 
demands (e.g. to be allowed to leave hospital). 

3. Benzodiazepines depress respiration. FLUMAZENIL should be available. Give if respiratory 
rate is < 10 breaths/minute (200micrograms IV, then 100microg at 60 second intervals, if 
required, maximum dose 1mg). It is short-acting and may need repeating or infusing (100-
400microg/hour). 

4. For IM use, LORAZEPAM should be diluted with an equal volume of water for injection or 
0.9% NaCl, immediately before injection.  

5. Combinations of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics have an additive effect allowing smaller 
doses of each to be used. 

6. Never mix LORAZEPAM (or DIAZEPAM) with any other drugs in the same syringe. Give 
separate injections. 

7. PROCYCLIDINE (5mg IM) injection must be available for acute dystonias. Repeat, if 
necessary, after 20 minutes. Maximum dose 20mg in 24 hours. 

8. Avoid phenothiazines or other antipsychotics in acute alcohol withdrawal. There are separate 
guidelines for non-emergency alcohol withdrawal and detoxification. Oral CHLORDIAZEPOXIDE 
is the drug of first choice. 

9. Use small doses for small people. Required dose of neuroleptic depends on age, body build, 
physical frailty, co-morbid diagnoses, severity of management problem, previous 
exposure/response to neuroleptics, and skill of nurses. 

10. Patients with dementia, especially Lewy body dementia, are particularly prone to side-
effects. If antipsychotics are given at all, very low doses should be used. 

Physical abuse 

The signs of physical abuse are often evident but can also be hidden by the abuser or the 
victim.  Any unexplained injuries should always be fully investigated.  Evidence to look out for 
includes: 

• Cuts, lacerations, puncture wounds, open wounds, bruises, welts, discoloration, black 
eyes, burns, bone fractures, broken bones, and skull fractures 

• Untreated injuries in various stages of healing or not properly treated 

• Poor skin condition or poor skin hygiene 

• Dehydration and/or malnourished without illness-related cause 

• Loss of weight 

• Soiled clothing or bed 

• Broken eyeglasses/frames, physical signs of being subjected to punishment, or signs of 
being restrained 

• Inappropriate use of medication, overdosing or under-dosing 

• An older person telling you they have been hit, slapped, kicked, or mistreated  

Psychological abuse 

Psychological abuse is the most common type of abuse.  It invariably involves identifying 
something - a person or an object - that matters to an older person and then threatening to 
endanger it unless the older person complies with demands.  The most common examples are 
threatening access to grandchildren (if someone lives at home) or denying access to family 
visits (if someone lives in a residential home). 

It is rare for psychological abuse to happen in isolation and often it is linked to financial abuse.  
Other terms for psychological abuse would be coercion or intimidation, and these are usually 
crimes. 

Psychological abuse can have a profound impact on someone's mental health; they can feel 
trapped, threatened, humiliated, used or a combination of all these.  Most signs therefore 
relate to someone's mental state, and changes in behaviour. 

• Helplessness 

• Hesitation to talk openly 

• Implausible stories 

• Confusion or disorientation 

• Anger without apparent cause 

• Sudden change in behaviour 

• Emotionally upset or agitated 

• Unusual behaviour (sucking, biting, or rocking) 

• Unexplained fear 

• Denial of a situation 

• Extremely withdrawn and non-communicative or non-responsive 

• An older person telling you they are being verbally or emotionally abused 

• Signatures on cheques etc., that do not resemble the older person's signature, or signed 
when the older person cannot write; 

• Sudden changes in bank accounts, including unexplained withdrawals of large sums of 
money by a person accompanying the older person 

• The inclusion of additional names on an older person's bank account 

• Abrupt changes to, or the sudden establishment of, wills 

• The sudden appearance of previously uninvolved relatives claiming their rights to an older 
person's affairs or possessions 

• The unexplained sudden transfer of assets to a family member or someone outside the 
family 

• Numerous unpaid bills, or overdue rent, when someone else is supposed to be paying the 
bills 

• Unusual concern by someone that an excessive amount of money is being expended on 
the care of the older person 

• Lack of amenities, such as TV, personal grooming items, appropriate clothing, that the 
older person should be able to afford 

• The unexplained disappearance of funds or valuable possessions such as art, silverware, or 
jewellery 

• Deliberate isolation of an older person from friends and family, resulting in the caregiver 
alone having total control 

On occasions banks and solicitors are found to have assisted in the misuse of Enduring Powers 
of Attorney. Only the new Lasting Power of Attorney needs to be registered with the Court of 
Protection before it is used and even then there is little to prevent a determined attorney from 
financially abusing an incapacitated donor. A useful first step if abuse is suspected is to contact 
by letter the bank of the donor and any estate agent involved – they will be able to let the 
solicitor know that someone is keeping a watching brief. 

Sexual abuse 

Very often the behaviour of an older person, even if they have confusion, will tell you that 
something is wrong.  Even with dementia people can often make their feelings known to you if 
you take the time to listen, observe and take notice.  It is the capacity to believe that elder 
sexual abuse is possible, without seeing it everywhere that will increase the potential to detect 
and respond to it when it happens. 

Just 2% of calls to the AEA helpline relate to sexual abuse. This is certainly an under-
representation, taking all that we know about elder abuse in general and about sexual abuse in 
its widest sense. 

• Some of the physical signs to watch for are:  

• Bruises around the breasts or genital area;  

• Unexplained venereal disease or genital infections; 

• Unexplained vaginal or anal bleeding;  

• Difficulty in walking or standing; 

• Marked changes in behaviour 

• Torn, stained, or bloody underclothing; 

• An older person telling you they have been sexually assaulted or raped.  

Neglect 

Neglect will often manifest in the physical, social or health circumstances of the older person. 

• Dirt, faecal or urine smell, or other health and safety hazards in older person's living 
environment 

• Rashes, sores, or lice on him/her 

• The older person is inadequately clothed 

• The older person is malnourished or dehydrated 

• The older person has an untreated medical condition 

• The older person has poor personal hygiene 

• There is evidence of the withholding of medication or over-medication of the older person;  

• There is evidence of a lack of assistance with eating and drinking 

• There are unsanitary and unclean conditions 

In considering neglect it is also important to recognise that there are occasions when someone 
will choose a particular lifestyle that is considered by others to be poor. There is a difference 
between a chosen pattern of behaviour and neglect by others that causes a deterioration in an 
older person’s circumstances and condition. If there is doubt the tests from the Mental 
Capacity Act 2005 can be applied, particularly as it recognises the right if all of us to at times 
make unwise decisions. 

In addition, it is important in taking responsibility for tackling potentially abusive situations 
that everyone accepts their own responsibility and understands the role of the Safe Guarding 
Board. This section outlines the primary responsibility of those working in ED and the hospital 
setting but also needs to recognise and deal with attendance or admissions where there is 
suspected abuse or safe discharge practice where abuse is a risk when the person returns 
home.

The development of acute geriatrics in St George’s 

Background 

St Georges Healthcare covers a population of approximately 300,000 people. All acute medical 
admissions are dealt with by the on call team based in the Acute Medical Unit (AMU). This has 
72 beds with an average length of stay of 0.9 days and readmission rate of 7% (March 2011). 

Challenges 

• There was no geriatric input in the emergency department which meant that older people 
did not receive a comprehensive geriatric assessment which meant critical decisions on 
safe admissions avoidance, early discharge and follow up with other services such as the 
day hospital could not be made.  

• Combined with this there were insufficient therapists with expertise in older people’s 
complex conditions to allow safe and early mobilisation and multi-disciplinary care 
assessments to allow discharge to rehabilitation services in the community.  

• Services at St Georges were also not adjusted to the change in local demographics which 
has seen the increase proportion of older people.  

This all led to inappropriate admissions, especially for some care home residents at the end of 
their life. An audit done in A&E found that the majority of older patients were over 86 years old 
and 60% did not need an acute medical admission and could be managed as outpatients or in 
other ways. 

Developing a new model 

• Appointment of an acute geriatrician and physician based in AMU. This raised the number 
of geriatricians to two but turned out to be a partial solution as demand increased. A third 
senior acute geriatrician was appointed based at the front door to allow flexibility and 
capacity to develop an outreach role into the community. 

• Development of the first Rapid Access Clinic for Elderly and Acute Medicine. This service 
had the use of a virtual clinic to facilitate follow up without the need for unnecessary 
outpatient appointments.  

• Review of local social services and integration of community services with the trust. 

• Increase the number and hours covered by the Social and Therapists Assessment and 
Rehabilitation team (STAR) to enable better discharge to intermediate care facilities.  

Initial results 

Since the placing a geriatrician in AMU and the increased resources of the STAR team the 
number of patients discharged and not admitted to hospital has increased from a mean of 47 
per month (July to September 2010) to 117 per month (October 2010 to February 2011). 

Next steps – completing the model 

• Clinical governance structure: audit cycles with implementation of results. 

• Education and training: be part of the geriatric medicine teaching programme.  

• Champions for range of areas including dementia and falls and bone heath. 

• Establish links with specialties for in-reach including cardiology and palliative care. 

• Provide geriatric expertise to develop pathways to medicine and surgery. 

• Establish an acute geriatrics unit (AGU). This will be crated after the model is developed. 
Patients admitted to the AGU would be expected to have a maximum length of stay of 5 
days. Patients suitable for this service would have one or more of the following two or 
more co-morbidities, history of falls, social issues, recurrent attendances/admission to 
hospital and cognitive problems. 

• Improve links with community services, local care homes and GPs. 

• Outreach Geriatric service. The model would seek to develop a proactive service to GPs to 
help manage patients with complex conditions in their own homes or care homes.

The development of acute geriatrics in Lanarkshire 

NHS Lanarkshire has been developing a more proactive role in the front door of their acute 
hospitals. Geriatricians take part in parallel receiving in the Medical Admissions Units alongside 
General physicians. Case finding is achieved by advanced nurse practitioners (Urgent care for 
the Elderly or ACE Nurses) who are responsible for identifying patients who would benefit from 
CGA review according to need. They are involved in multidimensional assessment ensuring 
their cognition, mobility, falls risks, nutrition and social and family circumstances are correctly 
identified in time for discussion at a multidisciplinary ward round. They are also involved in 
onward referrals and feedback to families and carers. Access to CGA beds for appropriate 
patients is seen as a local standard and prospectively audited. 

Access to a specialty bed for all frail older patients was an agreed aim of the specialty and the 
goal of achieving ‘the right patient to the right place right away’ was felt to add quality, 
efficiency and capacity management potential. In one hospital, resourced with Consultant 
sessions and an additional ACE Nurse, a quiet, well lit four bedded acute assessment room 
(ACE Unit) was opened next to A&E and the admissions ward. Patients were identified as 
appropriate for specialty as early after arrival in A&E as possible, discussed with relevant 
clinicians and ‘pulled through’ to the assessment area. Patients were restricted as little as 
possible, medications were rationalised, cannulae and catheters were avoided where possible 
and immediate or early mobilisation was the routine. Families were involved early in the 
patients care and proactive, multidimensional assessment, rapid diagnostics and senior review 
were standard. Patients who could safely be managed at home were actively discharged and 
other patients appropriate for specialty were transferred where possible direct to acute 
geriatric beds on the day of admission. Where appropriate, discussions with patients and 
families might include anticipatory care plans, discussions of CPR and occasionally the 
Liverpool Care Pathway. All discharges were communicated in writing to the GP within 48 
hours. Onward referrals to Social services, Early Supported Discharge schemes and district 
nurses were coordinated from the unit.   

The unit resulted in 25%  same day discharges, a reduced overall mean and median length of 
stay for admissions by one day, improved patient and carer satisfaction and reduced 
complaints. Staff satisfaction in A&E was high. The unit was able to reduce demand on 
downstream CGA beds as well as manage the demand on senior clinicians’ workloads. In part 
as a consequence of reduced downstream bed requirements a ward of 20 beds was closed.  
The ACE Nurses have also been in receipt of a Scottish Health Care Award.  The challenge in 
maintaining the units effectiveness are bed capacity downstream leading to reduced discharge 
or direct specialty admission capacity. 

Background 

Urgent care in older people generate a significant demand in the NHS in Wales - at the hospital 
front door, the acute in-patient wards, community hospitals and services, intermediate care 
facilities and in primary care. In 2007, 17% of people in Wales above 70 years of age had been 
a hospital in-patient in the previous 12 months.1   Wales has the highest proportion of people 
of State Pensionable Age (SPA) in the whole of the UK, with a higher proportion of older people 
residing in rural than the urban areas. Between 2007 and 2031, the number of people resident 
in Wales above 85 years of age is projected to increase by more than two-fold to 156,400.1  

The NHS in Wales has a model that promotes service planning across Local Authority (LA) 
areas rather than competitive commissioning. It is delivered through 7 Local Health Boards 
(LHBs) which are coterminous with the Welsh LA boundaries and 3 NHS Trusts including the 
Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust. The Welsh Government’s Minister for Health and Social 
Services is responsible for all aspects of the Welsh NHS. In 2008, Wales became the first 
country in the UK to appoint a Commissioner for Older People whose remit is to safeguard and 
champion the interests of people over 60 years of age living in Wales.   

Since devolution, the Welsh Government has produced multiple reviews and documents in 
relation to health and well-being in older people in Wales. These include Fundamentals of Care 
(2003) for health and social services, the National Service Framework for Older People in 
Wales (2006), Strategy for Older People in Wales (2008-2013) and Growing Old My Way 
(2012). Many of these also lay out standards of urgent care of older people in acute and 
community settings, emphasising themes like dignity and respect, nutrition, medicines 
management, pain control, falls and immobility and prevention of pressure sores. Since 2008, 
the 1000 Lives campaign, and the on-going 1000 Lives Plus National Programme have been 
successful in implementing various interventions and safeguards to improve, amongst other 
aspects, components of urgent care, though plans for specific campaign initiatives in relation 
to assessments and interventions in older people with complex care needs is on-going.2  

Examples of urgent geriatric care in Wales 

Given the wide variation in geography, demography, clinical needs of patients and access to 
specialist services, acute geriatric care is delivered through a variety of tailored models across 
the hospitals (acute and community), primary care, intermediate care and in other community 
services in Wales. In the community, some of these step-up urgent care services are led by 
either consultant geriatricians (Cardiff & Vale model; Torfaen model) or GPs with special 
interests or by locality GPs in ‘enhanced care’ models with regular formal input from consultant 
geriatrician (North Denbighshire), supported by teams of Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANP) 
and other multi-disciplinary professionals.  

In Cardiff and Vale, the consultant-led Emergency Care Assessment Service (ECAS), based at 
Rookwood Hospital in Llandaff, provides urgent Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) 
and multidisciplinary review of frail older people who are at risk of, or who are deteriorating in 
the community, taking referrals from the GPs and other hospital based services in Cardiff. The 
ECAS model also links with the evolving Community Resource Teams (CRTs) in Cardiff and 
Vale that provide urgent admission prevention step-up care whilst also pulling out step-down 
patients from the acute sector. 

A Frail Older Persons Assessment and Liaison (FOPAL) Service is undergoing stepwise 
development at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, targeting emergency management of 
frail older people within the Medical Admissions Unit (MAU) offering CGA and multidisciplinary 
assessments whilst linking with the CRTs and the mental health teams. The FOPAL team 
consists of consultant geriatricians, senior geriatric assessment liaison nurses and other 
members of the multi-disciplinary teams. Further phases of developments include provision of 
dedicated 8-10 ‘Frailty beds’ within the Clinical Decision Unit that will be supported by the 
FOPAL team. 

The Swansea Community Resource Team (CRT) employs around 50 WTE professionals. The 
‘front end’ hospital avoidance services include emergency therapy, emergency domiciliary care, 
rapid access to a consultant-led CGA, Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST) pathways 
including older patients with falls and subsequent referral to the CRT, CRT joint emergency 
placement rota with the LA, CRT support to MAU, District Nurse and GP out-of-hours services. 
Recently 5 ‘GP Champions’ from each locality in Swansea have been contracted 1 session/week 
as a pilot to assist the geriatrician for more pro-active management of acutely ill frailer older 
people in the community. The team has a patient load of approximately 300 at a given time. 
400 patients (282 new) were seen in the geriatrician-led CRT rapid access clinic in the last 
year and over 40 patients had urgent domiciliary visits from the geriatrician linked to the CRT. 

One of the aspects of urgent geriatric care delivered by the Community Intermediate 
Integrated Service (CIIS) team in Neath Port Talbot locality include administration of 
intravenous (IV) antibiotics in the community to appropriate patients in liaison with GPs, 
consultants and microbiologists. The patients remain either under the care of the GP or an 
intermediate care consultant geriatrician. This service has enabled early discharge of patients 
from the hospital front door and avoidance of an acute admission. Between January to 
December 2011, the antibiotic service had received 57 referrals (35% from primary care) 
resulting in a cost saving of approximately £57,000. The CIIS have also been providing urgent 
geriatric care and prompt access to CGA and investigations through Rapid Access Clinics based 
at the Elderly Day Unit in Neath Port Talbot hospital.  

Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend is piloting involvement of a team comprising of a 
consultant geriatrician, two ANPs, a junior nurse practitioner and a junior doctor to undertake 
prompt assessments and care of frail older patients (≥ 75 years of age) at the hospital front 
door (ED and CDU), identified through a case finding tool based on frailty markers, on a daily 
basis. Appropriate cases requiring admission are fast-tracked directly to a Care of the Elderly 
ward, whilst other patients are discharged with follow-up clinic assessments if needed.  

Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, (catchment population of approximately 220,000) 
has average yearly attendance at the Emergency Department of 56,000 of which 15.8% have 
been patients 75 years of age and above. The 30-bedded Acute Medial Unit (AMU) has 4 
consultant physicians with an average annual turnover of over 16,000 patients. The AMU 
consultants also engage in acute assessments at the Emergency Department. Five Care of the 
Elderly (COTE) consultants participate in a parallel morning post-take ward rounds at the AMU 
frontline 7-days a week to review newly admitted patients ≥ 75 years of age. This review is 
followed by a multi-disciplinary assessment by the Assessment Discharge & Transfer (ADT) 
team, where appropriate. This arrangement also allows assessments for suitability of older 
patients to step-down to an appropriate community hospital bed or an intermediate care 
facility that are subsequently processed via the Single Point of Access. Patients are also 
identified for rapid access falls and geriatric clinics. Introduction of this parallel COTE 
consultant-led post-take AMU rounds has resulted in a reduced length of stay of older people, 
controlled re-admission rates and a safer and seamless step-down of suitable patients to 
community hospitals.  

These examples notwithstanding, further changes in the way urgent geriatric care is delivered 
across the different service models and LAs in Wales are likely to occur in the future in view of 
service reviews and reconfiguration agendas across some of the LHBs, dynamic evolution and 
modernisation of the existing models and the Welsh Government’s long-term vision of 
providing more care closer to patient’s home with primary and community services being at 
the centre of care delivery and better integration across primary, community, acute care and 
social care.3

The development of the Emergency Frailty Unit and the Frail Older Peoples’ Advice and Liaison 
Service at Leicester Royal Infirmary make up the strategy at University Hospitals of Leicester 
(UHL) for creating a ‘frail friendly front door’. The aim of these services is to try to improve the 
care received by frail older people in hospital and reduce unnecessary hospital admissions, 
lengths of stay and readmissions. Each of the services works to deliver comprehensive geriatric 
assessment for each identified frail older person, joining together doctors, nurses, 
physiotherapists, occupational therapists, primary care co-ordinators, physician assistants and 
discharge specialists to provide an integrated response. 

Emergency Frailty Unit (EFU) 

The EFU is a central area within the Emergency Decisions Unit designed to improve the quality 
of care and decision making for frail older people in the Emergency department. It delivers 
multidisciplinary assessment from nurses, primary care coordinators, therapists and 
geriatricians at the front door enabling patients to have comprehensive geriatric assessment at 
presentation to facilitate an appropriate patient pathway. Appropriate patients are identified by 
the ED staff, assisted by using the Identification of seniors at risk tool which is a 6 item 
questionnaire used to identify older people at risk of functional decline, institutionalisation and 
death following discharge from ED. These patients are transferred to EFU rather than admitted 
to AMU for assessment. 

There is a multidisciplinary ward round of these patients every morning focussed on 
determining a frail older person’s medical, psychological and functional capability in order to 
develop a coordinated and integrated plan for treatment and follow-up. The length of stay for 
patients 85+ on EFU is 0.4 days, and the overall discharge rate for 85+ has increased by 20% 
compared to last year. The Geriatricians work closely with ED and provide in reach into ED 
throughout the day – supporting the ED staff with the assessment of older people.  

We are currently developing an EFU outreach service. This would see a primary care 
coordinator from the EFU work in a joint fashion with community teams to case manage 
selected high risk frail older people who have recently been discharged from EFU to ensure 
they receive the right care, at the right time, in the right place. 

Frail Older Persons’ Advice and Liaison (FOPAL) 

Frail older patients are identified daily on AMU by the Urgent care Admissions Specialist Nurses 
for FOPAL intervention. The nurses are employed by the Trust to help facilitate timely 
discharge for patients with complex medical and social needs. The majority of their work is 
with frail older adults and their carers and relatives, as well as social services, nursing and 
residential home staff. Once a patient has been identified and they have been seen by the 
Acute Medical team, a comprehensive assessment by the FOPAL team begins. At present the 
FOPAL team is made up of a Consultant Geriatrician, physician assistant, physiotherapy and 
occupational therapy colleagues. In the future it is hoped to expand the team to include mental 
health colleagues specialising in older adults. A FOPAL review is not intended to repeat the 
work done in the Emergency Department or by the AMU team but provides a comprehensive 
geriatric assessment for the patient. We have the time to look through past admissions, look 
for themes, talk to patients, their relatives and carers, General Practitioners, social workers 
and do the investigative work that is so often missed, not always due to lack of wanting but 
often lack of time. Once a FOPAL plan has been agreed for the patient a discussion with AMU 
team leads to an agreed final management plan which can be implemented. This could be for 
the patient to be discharged home, with or without community interventions, or to go to a 
community hospital or a ward.  Patients can be referred as necessary to falls prevention 
programmes, geriatrician clinic follow ups, district nurses, Intermediate Care teams and the 
myriad of community services available. Also issues such as advanced care planning can be 
instigated with patients, families and GPs to give patients a better quality of life out of hospital.  

The FOPAL service discharges six times as many frail older people as the AMU, with low 
readmission rates and to date no inappropriate deaths following discharge. 

An example of joint working in Essex 

As reported recently in the Guardian, 6.12.11, South-east Essex, comprising Southend, Castle 
Point and Rochford, used to have a high rate of hospital admissions. In 2008-09, there were 
9,624 admissions into acute care of people aged 65 or over at a cost of £22.8m. Forecast 
spending for this year is £21.5m and admissions are 20% down on 2010. 

Emergency care practitioners (ECP) are first on the scene and are able to make initial 
diagnoses, call upon therapy and recovery teams which together can formulate an action plan. 

Falls are the chief reason for hospital admission of older people. Since last September, a 
"community falls car" driven by an ECP has been responding to selected emergency calls on 
behalf of older people across south-east Essex. By the end of March this year, it had attended 
966 calls, of which 756 resulted in treatment on the spot and only 210 led to a hospital 
admission. 

Other innovations include: a community geriatrician scheme, offering the kind of multi-
disciplinary care and support of people in their own homes that they would get in hospital; a 
"filter" team, including GPs, nurses and social workers, at Southend hospital's A&E 
department, to help prevent unnecessary admissions; and a day assessment unit at the 
hospital, a specialist falls team and a 25-bed intermediate care ward to help people prepare to 
return home after an admission and to help prevent their readmission. 

The major innovation is the SPOR – a single point of referral, operating 24/7,  by which GPs 
and others can engage the focus of all health and social care agencies on the needs of an 
individual older person who can be assured of action within two hours in urgent cases. 

Taking account of all strands of the programme, including fewer admissions to residential care, 
a total saving of £7.3m was initially forecast for 2011-12 across south-east Essex. That has 
been revised down to £3.8m, partly because the hospital admissions that have been avoided 
so far have typically been relatively low-cost. Fewer admissions of more complex cases, such 
as stroke, have been avoided than had been anticipated. Understanding the Risk Stratification 
helped with this as did a positive history of joint working across health and social care. Essex. 
Another factor is relatively sophisticated information technology: the Care Trak system enables 
identification of the precise costs of one individual's care package, and care history, relative to 
others.

Activities of daily living 
• Basic activities of daily living include: 

o Washing and dressing 

o Eating and drinking 

o Using the toilet (bowels and 
bladder) 

o Transfers (e.g. on and off a chair, 
bed or toilet) 

• Extended activities of daily living include: 

o Preparing meals and shopping 

o Housework and laundry 

o Outdoor mobility, including using 
public transport 

Assessment vs. screening 
• Assessment tools are used to assess 
individuals presenting with a specific 
problem (e.g. falls) and determine which 
factors are present which can be 
managed in order to improve outcomes 
(e.g. visual assessment leading to 
referral for cataract surgery). 

• Screening is a public health service in 
which members of a defined population, 
who do not necessarily perceive they are 
at risk of, or are already affected by, a 
disease or its complications, are asked a 
question or offered a test to identify 
those individuals who are more likely to 
be helped than harmed by further tests 
or treatment to reduce the risk of disease 
or its complications157. 

Frail older people 
Older people are defined as those aged 65 
years or more, and frail older people are 
defined as older people with complex needs, 
typically with multiple co-morbidities, and 
often a combination of physical disability and 
cognitive impairment. A widely used definition 
of frailty includes those people who are 
‘dependent on others for the activities of daily 
living, or terminally ill or help is needed with 
both instrumental and non-instrumental 
activities of daily living’158. 

Geriatric giants, also referred to as frailty 
syndromes 

These syndromes are common presentations 
of acute illness in older people, and include: 

• 
Falls, collapse and syncope 

• 
Sudden onset of reduced mobility 

• 
Confusion 

• 
Polypharmacy (>3 prescribed drugs) 

• 
Continence issues (bladder or bowels) 

• 
Social issues, including isolation 

• 
Suspected older abuse 

Interdisciplinary vs. multidisciplinary 
Practitioners from different disciplines 
working collaboratively with shared 
responsibility towards a common patient goal. 
Interdisciplinary teams have greater 
interdependencies with some shared 
interdependent roles vs. multi-disciplinary 
teams of practitioners working in parallel to 
address various patient care needs. 

Self-efficacy 
People’s belief in their capabilities to achieve 
a goal or outcome, as such, self-efficacy plays 
a key role in motivation and how people 
engage e.g. with health care professionals 

Senior decision maker 
A senior decision maker is a consultant 
(doctor, nurse or therapist), ST4+ trainee or 
equivalent non-training grade doctor, or a 
specialist nurse or therapist. 

Clinician 
Throughout this document we have used the 
term clinician to imply a health professional 
from any background, which will vary 
according the context. Where appropriate, 
specific disciplines are highlighted 
individually.
