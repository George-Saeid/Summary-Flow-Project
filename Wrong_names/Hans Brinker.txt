PREFACE

THE
story of Hans Brin

‘ker, or of any boy born and

bred in Holland ,
canri

°
ot be ﬁtly told without including

something of the story of Holland itself,

-of its history,

its oddities , and the leading characteristics of its heroic
and thrifty people .
All these must be borne in mind ,

for some of the traits peculiar to his race are ingrained
in every Hollander, young or old , and Holland is as dif

fer ent from Elsewhere as
can be imagined .

Therefore, necessary and careful descriptions of Dutch

life and customs have been given in the narrative, and
many of the incidents are drawn directly from life .
Even

the wonderful experiences
of Raff Brinker are founded

strictly upon fact .

While acknowledging my obligations to many well

known writers on Dutch history, literature and art, I
turn with especial gratitude to two kind friends , natives
of Holland , who, after their marriage, had taken up their
abode in this country .
With generous zeal, they patiently

answered questions , and took many a backward glance
at their country for my sake, seeing it as it looked , years
ago , when the humble home of the B rinker s crouched by
the sheltering dike in sunlight and shadow .

It w a s my tardy good fortune to visit Holland not long

after this book was written , and see with my own eyes
the land I had tried to picture for my readers .
The

PREFACE

Brinker cottage w as empty, and many things in Holland
had changed since the days when Hans and his little
sister skated on the frozen

“ Y .

”
But , to my joy, every

detail of the earlier picture of the country was veriﬁed .
Holland w as still wonderful,

—in fact , more wonderful ;

for time only increased the marvel of its not being washed
away by the sea .

Its cities have grown , and , in some of them , national

costumes have given place to the conventional European
dress of the day .
A few of its peculiarities have been

brushed away by contact with other nations ; but it is
Holland still, and always will be ; full of oddity, courage
and industry,

— the pluckiest little country on earth .

HANS
AND GRETEL

ON a bright December morning long ago, two poorly

clad children were kneeling upon the bank of a frozen
canal in Holland .

The sun had not yet appeared ; but the gray sky w a s

parted near the horizon, and its edges shone crimson
with the coming day .
Most of the good Hollanders

were enjoying a placid morning nap :
even Mynheer

von Stopp elnoz e, that worthy old Dutchman, was still
slumbering

“ in beautiful repose .

”

NOW and then some peasant-woman, poising a well

fi lled basket upon her head , came skimming over the
glassy surface of the canal ;
or a lusty boy skating to

his day

’s work in the town, cast a good-natured grimace

toward the shivering pair as he ﬂew along .

Meanwhile, with many a vigorous puff and pull, the

brother and sister, for such they were, seemed to be fast

ening something upon their feet,

— not skates, certainly,

but clumsy pieces of wood narrowed and smoothed at

4
i s
!
HANS! BRINKER

their lower edge, and pierced with holes, through which
were threaded strings of raw-hide .

These queer-looking
aﬁ

’
air s had been made by the boy

Hans .
His mother was a poor peasant-woman, too poor

to even think of such a thing as buying skates for her
little ones .
Rough as these were, they had
aﬁ

’
o rd ed the

children many a happy hour upon the ice ; and now, as
with cold , red ﬁngers , our young Hollanders tugged at
the
Strings , their solemn faces bending closely over their

knees, no vision of impossible iron runners came to dull
the satisfaction glowing within .

In a moment the boy arose, and with a pompous

swing of the arms, and a careless

“ Come on , Gretel !

”

glided easily across the canal .

Ah , Hans !

” called his sister, plaintively,
this foot

is not well yet .
The strings hurt me on last market-day ;

and now I cannot h ear them tied in the same place .

Tie them higher up , then ,
answered Hans , as , with

out looking at her, he performed a wonderful cat

’s-cradle

step on the ice .

“ How can I ?
The string is too short .

Giving vent to a good-natured Dutch whistle, the

English of which was , that girls were troublesome crea
tures , he steered toward her .

“ You are foolish to wear such shoes , Gretel, when you

have a stout leather pair .
Your klompen‘ would be bet

ter than these .

”

1 Wooden shoes.

HANS
AN D GRETEL
5

Why, Hans !
Do you forget ?
The father threw my

beautiful new shoes in the ﬁre .
Before I knew what he

had done, they were all curled up in the midst of the
burning

‘ peat :
I
c an skate with these, but not with my

qvood en ones .
Be careful now

Hans had taken a
string from his pocket .
Humming

a tune as he knelt beside her, he proceeded to fasten
Gretel

’s skate with all the force of his strong young arm .

“ Oh , oh
Sh e cried in real pain .

With an impatient jerk, Hans unwound the string .

He would have cast it upon the ground in true big
brother style, had he not just then spied a tear trickling
down his
Sister

’s cheek .

“ I

’ll ﬁx it , never fear,
he said with sudden tender

ness ;
but w e must be quick .
The mother will need us

soon .

Then he glanced inquiringly about him , ﬁrst at the

ground , next at some bare willow-branches above his
head , and ﬁnally at the sky, now gorgeous with
Streaks

of blue, crimson and gold .

Finding nothing in any of these localities to meet his

need , his eye suddenly brightened , as , with the air of a
fellow who knew what he was about , he took
Off his

c ap , and , removing the tattered lining, adjusted it in a
smooth pad over the top of Gretel

’s aching foot .

“Now,

” he cried triumphantly, at the same time
ar

ranging the strings as briskly as his benumbed ﬁngers
would allow,

“

c an you h ea r some pulling ?

”

HANS
BRINKER

Gretel drew up her lips as if to say,
Hurt away,

but made no further response .

In another moment they were laughing together, as ,

hand in hand , they ﬂew along the canal, never thinking
whether the ice would bear or not ;
for in Holland ice

is generally an all-winter
aﬁ air .
It settles itself upon

the water in a determined kind of way ; and , so far from
growing thin and uncertain every time the sun is a little
severe upon it, it gathers its forces day by day, and
ﬂashes deﬁance to every beam .

Presently squeak, squeak ! sounded

, something beneath

Hans

’ feet .
Next his strokes grew shorter, ending oft

times with a jerk, and , ﬁnally, he lay sprawling upon
the ice, kicking against the air with many a fantastic
ﬂourish .

“ Ha, ha !

” laughed Gretel,
that was a ﬁne tumble .

But a tender heart was beating under her coarse blue
jacket ;
and , even as she laughed ,
She came, with a

graceful sweep , close to her prostrate brother .

“Are you hurt, Hans ?
Oh , you are laughing !
Catch

me now !

”
And she darted away, shivering no longer,

but with cheeks all aglow and eyes sparkling with fun .

Hans sprang to his feet and started in brisk pursuit ;

but i t w as no easy thing to catch Gretel .
Before she

had travelled very far, her skates, too, began to squeak .

Believing that discretion was the better part of valor,

she turned suddenly and skated into her pursuer

’s arms .

“ Ha , ha !
I

’

v e caught ypu
cried Hans .

HANS
AND

” GRETEL
7

Ha, ha !
I caught you ,
she retorted ,
Str uggling

' to

free herself.

A boy and a girl whom they knew came skating toward

Just then a voice was heard calling,
Hans
Gretel !

“ It

’s the mother,

” said Hans , looking solemn in an

instant .

By this time the canal was gilded with sunlight .
The

pure morning air was very delightful, and
Skaters were

gradually increasing in numbers .
It was hard to obey

the summons .
But Gretel and Hans were good children .

Without a thought of yielding to the temptation to
linger, they pulled
off their ska tes , leaving half the knots

still tied .
Hans , with his great square shoulders, and

bushy yellow hair, towered high above his blue-eyed
little sister, as they trudged homeward .
He was ﬁfteen

years old , and Gretel was only twelve .
He was a solid ,

hearty-looking boy, with honest eyes, and a brow that
seemed to bear a sign,
goodness within,

” just as the

little Dutch
z omerhuiﬂ wears a motto over its portal .

Gretel was lithe and quick .
Her eyes had a dancing

light in them ;
and , while you looked at her cheek, the

color paled and deepened just as it does upon a bed of
pink-and-white blossoms when the wind is blowing .

AS soon as the Children turned from the canal, they

were near their parents

’ cottage .
Their mother

’s tall

form , arrayed in jacket and petticoat and close-ﬁtting

1 Summer-house .

HANS BRINKER

c ap , stood , like a picture, in the crooked frame of the
doorway .
Had the cottage been a mile away, it would

still have seemed near .
In that ﬂat country, every
Oh

j ect stands out plainly in the distance :
the chickens

show as distinctly as the windmills .
Indeed , were it

not for the dikes, and the high banks of the canals, one
could stand almost anywhere in Middle Holland with
out seeing a mound or a ridge between the eye and the

“jumping-off place .

”

None had better cause to know the nature of these

same dikes than Dame Brinker and the panting young

ster s now running at her call .
But, before stating why,

let me ask you to take a rocking-chair trip with me to
that far country, where you may see, perhaps for the
ﬁrst time, some curious things that Hans and Gretel saw
every day .

I o
HANS BRINKER

danger; but the croaking frog in neighboring bulrushes
is nearer the stars than she .
Water-bugs dart backward

and forward above the heads of the chimney-swallows ;
and willow-trees seem drooping with shame, because they
cannot reach as high as the reeds near by .

Ditches, canals, ponds, rivers and lakes are everywhere

to be seen .
High , but not dry, they shine in the sun

light , catching nearly all the h ustle and the business,
quite scorning the tame ﬁelds stretching damply

‘beside

them .
One is tempted to ask,

“ Which is Holland ,

— the

shores, or the water ?

”
The very verdure that should

be conﬁned to the land has made a mistake, and settled
upon the ﬁsh-ponds .
In fact, the entire country is a

kind of saturated sponge, or, as the English poet Butler
called it,

A land that
rides at anchor , and is moored ,

In which they do not live , but go aboa rd .

Persons are born, live, and die, and even have their

gardens, on canal-boats .
Farmhouses, with roofs like

great slouched hats pulled over their eyes, stand on
wooden legs with a tucked-up sort of air, as if to say,

“ We intend to keep dry if we can .

”
Even the horses

wear a wide stool on each hoof to lift them out of the
mire .
In short, the landscape everywhere suggests a

paradise for ducks .
It is a glorious country in summer

for barefooted
girls
and
boys .
Such wadings !
such

mimic
ship-sailing !
such
rowing,
ﬁshing
and
swim

HOLLAND
I I

mIng !
Only think of a chain of puddles, where one

c an launch chip boats
all day long, and never make

a return trip !
But enough .
A full recital would set

all young America rushing in a body toward the Zuyd er

Dutch cities seem at ﬁrst sight to be a bewildering

jungle of houses , bridges, churches and ships, sprouting
into masts , steeples and trees .
In some cities, vessels

are hitched , like horses, to their owners

’ door-posts, and

receive their freight from the upper windows .
Mothers

scream to
Lod ewyk and Kassy not to swing on
th e

garden-gate, for fear they may be drowned .
Water—roads

are more frequent there than common roads and rail
ways .
Water-fences , in the form of lazy green ditches ,

enclose pleasure-ground , polder and garden .

Sometimes ﬁne green hedges are seen ;
but wooden

fences, such as we have in America , are rarely met with
in Holland .
As for stone fences, a Dutchman would lift

his hands with astonishment at the very idea .
There is

no
Stone there, excepting those great masses of rock that

have been brought from other lands to strengthen and
protect the coast .
All the small stones or pebbles, if

there ever were any, seem to be imprisoned in pave
ments, or quite melted away .
Boys with strong, quick

arms may grow from pinafores to full beards, without
ever ﬁnding one to start the water-rings, or set the rab
bits ﬂying .
The water-roads are nothing less than canals

intersecting the country in every direction .
These are

1 2
HANS
BRINKER

of all sizes, from the great North Holland Ship Canal ,
which is the wonder of the world , to those which a boy

c an
leap .
Water-omnibuses,
called
tr ekn huiten,

‘ con

st antly ply up and down these roads for the conveyance
of passengers ;
and water-drays, called p akschuyten} are

used
for carrying fuel
and
merchandise .
Instead
of

green country lanes, green canals stretch from ﬁeld to
barn, and from barn to garden ;
and the farms, or pol

ders, as they are termed , are merely great lakes pumped
dry .
Some of the busiest streets are water ; while many

of the country roads are paved with brick .
The city

boats, with their rounded stem s, gilded prows and gayly
painted sides, are unlike any others under the sun ; and
a Dutch wagon, with its funny little crooked pole, is a
perfect mystery of mysteries .

“ One thing is Clear,

” cries Master Brightside,
the in

habitants need never be thirsty .

”
But, no, Odd-land is

true to itself still .
Notwithstanding the sea pushing to

get in, and the lakes struggling to get out, and the over
ﬂowing canals, rivers and ditches, in many districts there
is no water ﬁt to swallow : our poor Hollanders must go
dry, or drink wine and beer, or send far into the inland ,

1 Canal-boats.
Some
of the ﬁ rst-named
are
over thirty feet long .
They

look like greenhouses lodged on ba rges, and ar e d rawn by hor ses walking along
the bank of the canal .
The tr ekf chuiten
a re divided into two compa rtments,

ﬁ rst and second class; and , when not too crowded , the passenge rs make them

selves quite at home in them : the men
smoke, the women knit or
sew, while

child ren play upon the small outer deck .
Many of the canal-boats have white,

yellow or chocolate-colored
sails .
This last color is caused by a p reparation

of tan, which is put on to preserve them .

HOLLAND

to Utrecht and other favored localities, for that precious
ﬂuid older than Adam, yet young as the morning dew .
Sometimes, indeed , the inhabitants can swallow a shower,
when they are provided with any means of catching it ;
but generally they are like the albatross-haunted sailors
in Coleridge

’s famous p oem of

“The Ancient Mariner

”

:

they see

Wate r , wate r , eve rywhere,
Nor any d rop to d rink !

”

Great ﬂapping windmills all over the country make it
look as if ﬂocks of huge sea-birds were just settling upon
it .
Everywhere one sees the funniest trees, bobbed into

fantastical shapes, with their trunks painted a dazzling
white, yellow or red .
Horses
are often yoked three

abreast .
Men, women and children go clattering about

in wooden shoes with loose heels ; peasant-girls wh o
c an

not get beaux for love, hire them for money, to escort
them to the kar mi c;

1 and husbands and wives lovingly

ha rm s: themselves side by side on the bank of the canal,
and drag their p akr ckuytr to market .

Another peculiar feature of Holland is the
-dune,
or

sand-hill .
These are numerous along certain portions of

the coast .
Before they were sown with coarse reed

grass and other plants, to hold them down, they used to
send great
Storms of sand over the inland .
SO, to add

to the oddities, farmers sometimes dig down under the
surface to ﬁnd their soil ; and on windy days dry showers

(of sand) often fall upon ﬁelds that have grown wet under
a week of sunshine !

In short, almost the only familiar thing we Yankees

c an meet With in Holland is a harvest-song, which is
quite popular there, though no linguist could translate
it .
Even then, we must shut our eyes, and listen only

to the tune, which I leave you to guess .

”

On the other hand , many of the oddities of Holland

serve only to prove the thrift and perseverance of the
people .
There is not a richer or more carefully tilled

garden-spot in the whole world than this leaky, springy,
little country .
There is not a braver, more heroic race

than its quiet, passive-looking inhabitants .
Few nations

have equalled it in important discoveries and inventions ;
none has excelled it in commerce, navigation, learning
and science, or set as noble examples in the promotion
of education and public Charities ;
and none, in propor

tion to its extent, has expended more money and labor
upon public Works .

Holland has its shining annals of noble and illustrious

men and women, its grand historic records of patience,
resistance and victory, its religious freedom , its enlight
ened enterprise, its art , its music and its literature
It

has truly been called

“ the battle-ﬁeld of Europe :
as

HOLLAND
1 5

truly may w e consider it the asylum of the world ;
for

th e oppressed of every nation have there found shelter
and
encouragement .
If
w e
Americans

—
many
of us

surely of Holland stock

— can laugh at the Dutch , and

call them human beavers, and hint that their country
may ﬂoat
off any day
at high tide, w e
c an also know

that they have proved themselves heroes, and that their
country will
not ﬂoat
Off while there is a Dutchman left

to grapple it .

There are said to be at least ninety-nine hundred large

windmills in Holland , with sails ranging from eighty to
one hundred and twenty feet long .
They are employed

in sawing timber, beating hemp , grinding, and many
other kinds of work ; but their principal use is for pump
ing water from the lowlands into the canals, and for
guarding against the inland freshets that so often deluge
the country .
Their yearly cost is said to be nearly ten

millions of dollars .
The large ones are of great power .

Their huge, Circular tower, rising sometimes from the
midst
Of factory buildings, is surmounted with a smaller

one, tapering into a
caplike roof.
This upper tower is

encircled at its base with a balcony, high above which
juts the axis, turned by its four prodigious ladder-backed
sails .

Many of the Windmills are primitive affairs, seeming

sadly in need of Yankee
improvements ;
but some of

the new ones are admirable .
They are so constructed

that, by some ingenious contrivance, they present their

16
HANS BRINKER

fans, or wings, to the wind in precisely the right direction
to work with the requisite power .
In other words, the

miller may take a nap, and feel quite sure that his mill
will study the wind , and make the most of it, until he
wakens .
Should there be but a slight current of air,

every sail will spread itself to catch the faintest breath ;
but, if a heavy
blow

” should come, they will shrink at

its touch , like great mimosa-leaves, and only give it half
a Chance to move them .

One of the old prisons of Amsterdam , called the
Rasp

house,

” because thethieves and vagrants who were con

ﬁned there were employed in rasping logwood , had a cell
for the punishment of lazy prisoners .
In one corner of

this cell was a pump, and in another an opening, through
which a steady stream of water was admitted .
The pris

oner could take his choice,

-either to
Stand still and be

drowned ; or to work for dear life at the pump , and keep
the rising ﬂood down until relieved .
Now, it seems to

me that, throughout Holland , Nature has introduced
this little diversion on a grand scale .
The Dutch always

have been forced to pump for their very existence, and
probably must continue to do so to the end of time .

Every year millions of dollars are spent in repairing

dikes and regulating water-levels .
If these important

duties were neglected , the country would be
uninh abita

ble .
Already dreadful consequences, as I have said , have

followed the bursting of these dikes .
Hundreds of vil

lages and towns have, from time to time, been buried

18
HANS
BRINKER

even the graveyards gave up their dead .
The living in

fant in his cradle and the long-buried corpse in his cofﬁn
ﬂoated side by side .
The ancient ﬂood seemed about to

be renewed .
Everywhere

— upon the tops of trees, upon

the steeples of churches

— human beings were clustered ,

praying to God for mercy, and to their fellow-men for
assistance .
As the storm at last was subsiding, boats

began to ply in every direction, saving those wh o were
struggling in the water, picking fugitives from roofs and
tree-tops ,
and collecting the bodies of those already

drowned .
No less than
. one hundred
thousand human

beings had perished in a few hours .
Thousands upon

thousands of dumb creatures lay dead upon the waters ;
and the damage to property was beyond calculation .

Robles, the Spanish governor, was foremost in noble

eﬂ

'
ort s to save life, and lessen the horrors of th e catas

t r oph e .
He had formerly been hated by the Dutch , b e

cause
Of his Spanish or Portuguese blood ;
but, by his

goodness and activity in their hour of disaster, he won
all hearts to gratitude .
He soon introduced an improved

method of constructing the dikes, and passed a law that
they should in future be kept up by the owners of the soil .
There were fewer heavy ﬂoods from this time ; though ,
within less than three hundred years , six fearful inunda
tions swept over the land .

In the spring there is always great danger of inland

freshets , especially in times of thaw, because the rivers,
choked with blocks of ice, overﬂow before they can dis

HOLLAND
19

charge their rapidly rising waters into the ocean .
Add

to this the sea chaﬁng and pressing against the dikes and
it is no wonder that Holland is often in a state of alarm .
The greatest care is taken to prevent accidents .
Engi

neer s and workmen are stationed all along in threatened
places ;
and a close watch is kept up night and day .

When a general signal of danger is given, the inhabitants
all rush to the rescue, eager to combine against their
common foe .
As, everywhere else, straw is supposed to

be of all things the most helpless in the water, of course
in Holland it must be rendered the mainstay against a
rushing tide .
Huge straw mats are pressed against the

embankments, fortiﬁed with clay and heavy stone ; and ,
once adjusted , the ocean dashes against them in vain .

Raff Brinker,
th e father of Gretel and Hans, had for

years been employed upon the dikes .
It w as at the time

of a threatened inundation, when in the midst of a ter
rible storm, in darkness and sleet, the men were laboring
at a weak spot near the Veermyk sluice, that he fell
from the scaffolding, and was taken home insensible .
From that hour he never worked again .
Though he

lived on, mind and memory were gone .

Gretel could not remember him otherwise than as the

strange, silent man whose eyes followed her vacantly
whichever w ay she turned ; but Hans had recollections
of a hearty, cheerful-voiced father, wh o w as never tired
of he aring him upon his shoulder, and whose careless
song still seemed echoing near when he lay awake at
night and listened .

III

THE SILVER SKATES

DAME BRINKER earned a scanty support for her family

by raising vegetables, spinning and knitting .
Once she

h ad worked on board the barges plying up and down the
canal, and had occasionally been harnessed with other
women to the towing-rope of a p akr chuyt plying between
Broek
and Amsterdam .
But when Hans had grown

strong and large, he had insisted upon doing all such
drudgery in her place .
Besides, her husband had
b e

come so very helpless of late that he required her con
stant care .
Although he h ad not as much intelligence as

a little child , he w as yet strong of arm and very hearty ;
and
Dame
Brinker had
sometimes
great
trouble
in

controlling him .
When Hans
w as in the cottage, or

some kind-hearted passer-by came to her assistance on
hearing a noise within, the poor
wouw could get on

very well ; but, when she w as alone, it
w as a
diﬂ

’
er ent

matter .

“ Ah , children ! he was so good and steady,
she would

sometimes say,

“ and as wise as a lawyer .
Even the

THE SILVER S KATES
2 1

i
b u rgom aster would stop to ask him a question ;
and

now, alack ! he doesn

’t know his wife and little ones .

You remember the father, Hans, when he was himself,
a great brave man,

— don

’t you ?

”

“ ‘Yes,
indeed ,
mother !
He
knew
everything,
and

could do anything under the sun ;
and how he would

sing !
Why, you used to laugh , and say it was enough

to set the windmills dancing .

“ So
I
did .
Bless
me !
how the
boy
remembers !

Gretel, Child , take that knitting-needle from your father,
quick,

— he

’ll get it in his eyes, maybe,

-and put the

shoe on him .
His poor feet are like ice half the time ;

but I can

’t keep

’em covered , all I
c an do .

”
And then,

half wailing, half humming, Dame Brinker would sit
down and ﬁll the low cottage with the whir of her spin
ning-wheel .

Nearly all the outdoor work, as well as the household

labor, was performed by Hans and Gretel .
At certain

seasons of the year, the children went out day after day
to gather peat, which they would stow away in square,
brick-like pieces, for fuel .
At other times, when home

work permitted , Hans rode the towing-horses on the
canals , earning a few
Jtioerﬂ a day ;
and Gretel tended

geese for the neighboring farmers .

Hans w as clever at carving in wood ; and both he and

Gretel were good gardeners .
Gretel could sing and sew

and run on great high , home-made stilts better than any

She could learn a ballad in ﬁve

“

minutes, and ﬁnd , in its season, any weed or ﬂower you
could name .
But Sh e dreaded books ; and often the very

sight of the ﬁgu ring

-board in the old schoolhouse would

set her eyes swimming .
Hans, on the contrary, was slow

and steady .
The harder the task, whether in study or

daily labor, the better he liked it .
Boys
wh o sneered

at him out of school, on account of his patched clothes
and scant leather breeches , were forced to yield him the
post of honor in nearly every class .
It was not long

before he was the only youngster in the school wh o had
not stood at least
once in the corner of horrors, where

hung a dreaded whip, and over it this motto

It w as only in winter that Gretel and Hans could be

spared to attend school ;
and for the past month they

had been kept at home because their mother needed their
services .
Raff Brinker required constant
attention ; and

there was black-bread to be made, and the house to be
kept clean , and stockings and other things to be knitted
and sold in the market-place .

While they were busily assisting their mother on this

cold December morning, a merry troop of girls and boys
came skimming down the canal .
There were ﬁne skaters

among them ;
and , as the bright medley of costumes

ﬂitted by, it looked from a distance as though the ice

1 “Learn, learn, you idler ! or this rope

’

s end shall teach you .

THE SILVER SKATES

had suddenly thawed , and some gay tulip-bed were ﬂoat
ing along on the current .

There was the rich burgomaster

’s daughter, Hilda van

Gleck, with her costly furs and loose-ﬁtting velvet sack ;
and near by
a

'
p r etty peasant-girl, Annie Bouman, j aunt

ily attired in a coarse scarlet j acket, and a blue skirt
just short enough to display the gray homespun hose to
advantage .
Then there was
the proud Rychie Korbes,

whose father, Mynheer van Korbes, was one of the lead
ing men of Amsterdam ;
and , ﬂocking closely around

her, Carl Schummel , Peter and Ludwig1 van Holp, Jacob
Poot , and a very sm all b oy, rejoicing in the tremendous
name of Voostenw alb er t Schimmelp enninck .
There were

nearly twenty other boys and girls in the party ; and one
and all seemed full of excitement and frolic .

Up and down the canal, within the space of a half

mile, they skated , exerted their racing powers to the
ut

most .
Often the swiftest among them was seen to dodge

from under the very nose of some pompous law-giver or
doctor, wh o, with folded arms, was skating leisurely to
ward the town ; or a chain of girls would suddenly break
at the approach of a fat old burgomaster,
wh o, with

gold-headed cane poised in air, was
p uﬂi ng his way to

Amsterdam .
Equipped in skates wonderful to behold ,

— from their superb strappings,
and dazzling runners

curving toward the instep and topped with gilt balls;

1 Ludwig, Gretel and Carl were named after German friends.
Th e Dutch

he would open his fat eyes a little if one of the maidens
chanced to drop him a courtesy, but would not dare to
bow
In return, for fear of losing his balance .

Not only pleasure-seekers and stately men of note

were upon the canal .
There were work-people, with

weary eyes, hastening to their
Shops and factories ; mar

ket-women with loads upon their heads ; peddlers bend
ing with their packs ;
bargemen , with shaggy

. hair and

bleared faces, jostling roughly on their way ;
kind-eyed

clergymen speeding perhaps to the bedsides of the dying ;
and , after a while, groups of Children, with satchels slung
over their shoulders, whizzing past toward the distant
school .
One and all wore skates, excepting, indeed , a

mufﬂed-up farmer, whose queer cart bumped along on
the margin of the canal .

Before long our merry boys and girls were almost lost

in the confusion of bright colors , the ceaseless motion
and the gleaming of skates ﬂashing back the sunlight .
We might have known no more of them , had not the
whole party suddenly come to a standstill, and , group
ing themselves out of the way of the passers-by, all
talked at once to a pretty little maiden, whom they
had drawn from the tide of people ﬂowing toward the
town .

“ 0 Katrinka !

” they cried in a breath ,
have you

heard
of it ?
The race—
w e want you to join !

“What race ?

” asked Katrinka , laughing .

“ Don

’t all

talk at once, please : I can

’t understand .

THE SILVER SKATES

Every one panted and looked at Rychie Korbes, wh o

w as their acknowledged spokeswoman .

“Why,

” said

' Rychie,

“ we are to have a grand skat

ing-match on the
20th, on M ev r ouw1 van Gleck

It

’s all Hilda

They are going to give a

splendid prize to the best skater .

”

“ Yes,

” chimed in a half a dozen voices,
a beautiful

pair of sil ver skates

— perfectly magniﬁcent ! with oh ,

such straps and silver bells and buckles !

”

“ Who said they had bells

the boy with the big name .

“ I say so, Master Voo st,

“ No, I

“ Oh ! how can you say so ?

but Mynheer

matter with a decisive

and the chorus of conﬂicting Opinion broke

forth again .

“The girls

quietly ;

“ but there is to be another pair for the boys,

with an arrow engraved upon the sides .

”

Katrinka looked at them with bewildered eyes .

“ Who is to try ?

” she asked .

All of us,

” answered Rychie .
It will be such fun !

And you must, too, Katrinka .
But it

’s school-time now

we will talk it all over at noon .
Oh , you will join, of

course .

Katrinka, without replying, made a graceful pirouette,

and

— laughing out a coquettish ,

“ Don

’t you hear the

last bell ?
Catch me !

”

— darted
off toward the school

house, standing half a mile away on the canal .

All started pell-mell at this challenge ; but they tried

:

in vain to catch the bright-eyed , laughing creature, wh o,
with golden hair streaming in the sunlight , cast back
many a sparkling glance of triumph as she ﬂoated onward .

Beautiful Katrinka !
Flushed with youth and health ,

all life and mirth and emotion, what wonder thine image,
ever ﬂoating in advance, sped through one boy

’s dreams

that night !
What wonder that it seemed his darkest

hour, when, years afterward , thy presence ﬂoated away
from him forever !

HANS AND GRETEL FIND A FRIEND

AT noon our young friends poured forth from the

schoolhouse, intent upon having an hour

’s practising

upon the canal .

They had skated but a few moments when Carl Schum

mel said mockingly to Hilda,

“ There

’s a pretty pair just coming upon the ice !
The

little rag-pickers !
Their skates must have been a pres

ent from the king direct .

”

“ They are patient creatures,
said Hilda, gently .
It

must have been hard to learn to skate upon such queer
affairs .
They are very poor peasants, you see .
The boy

has probably made the skates himself.

Carl was somewhat abashed

Patient they may be ; but, as for skating, they start

off pretty well, only to ﬁnish with a jerk .
They could

move well to your new
sta ccato piece, I think .

”

Hilda laughed pleasantly, and left him .
After join

ing a small detachment of the racers, and sailing past

28
HANS
BRINKER

every one of them, she halted beside Gretel, who, with
eager eyes, had been watching the sport .

“What is your name, little girl ?

”

Gretel, my lady,

”
answered the child , somewhat

awed by Hilda

’s rank, though they were nearly of the

same age ;

“ and my brother is called Hans .

”

“ Hans is a stout fellow,

” said Hilda, cheerily,
and

seems to have a warm stove somewhere within him ; but

you look cold . You should wear more clothing, little one .

”

Gretel, wh o had nothing else to wear, tried to laugh ,

as
Sh e answered ,

“ I am not so very little .
I am past twelve years old .

Oh , I beg your pardon !
You see, I am nearly four

teen, and so large of my age that other girls seem small
to me ; but that is nothing .
Perhaps you will shoot up

far above me yet ; not unless you dress more warmly,
though : shivering girls never grow .

”

Hans ﬂushed as he saw tears rising in Gretel

’s eyes .

“ My sister has not complained of the cold ; but this

is bitter weather, they say ;

” and he looked sadly upon

Gretel .

“ It is nothing,
said Gretel .
I am often warm, too

,

warm, when I am skating .
You are good , j ufor ouw,

1 to

think of it .

”

“ No,
no !
answered Hilda, quite angry at herself.

I am careless, cruel ; but I meant no harm .
I wanted

In

or polite add ress, it

to ask you—
I mean

—
if
And here Hilda, coming to

the point of her errand , faltered before the poorly clad
but noble-looking children she wished to serve .

“ What is . it, young lady ?

” exclaimed Hans, eagerly .

If there is any service I can do ; any

Oh , no, no !

” laughed Hilda, shaking
off her embar

r assment .

“ I only wished to speak to you about the

grand race .
Why do you not join it ?
You both can

skate well ; and the ranks are free .
Any one may enter

for the prize .

”

Gretel looked wistfully at Hans, who, tugging at his

c ap , answered respectfully,

Ah , j ufor ouw, even if we could enter, we could skate

only a few strokes with the rest .
Our skates are hard

wood , you see

” (holding up the sole of his foot) ;
but

they soon become damp , and then they stick, and trip us .

”

Gretel

’s eyes twinkled with fun as she thought of Hans

’

mishap in the morning ; but she blushed as she faltered
out timidly,

“Oh , no ! w e can

’t join ;
but may we be there, my

lady, on the great day, to look on ?

”

“ Certainly,

” answered Hilda, looking kindly into the

two earnest faces, and wishing from her heart that she
had not spent so much of her monthly allowance for lace
and ﬁnery .
She had but eight lewa r tj er 1 left ;
and they

would buy but one pair of skates, at the furthest .

1 A lewa rtj e is a small silver coin worth one-quarter of a guilder , or ten cents

in American cur rency .

3o
HANS BRINKER

Looking down with a sigh at the two pairs of feet
so

very different in size, she asked,

“Which of you is the better skater ?

Gretel,

” replied Hans, promptly .

Hans,

” answered Gretel, in the same breath .

Hilda smiled .

“ I cannot buy you each a pair of skates, or even one

good pair ; but here are eight hwar tj er .
Decide between

you which stands the best chance of winning the race
and buy the skates accordingly .
I wish I had enough

to buy better ones .
Good-by l

”
And , with a nod and

a smile, Hilda, after handing the money to the elec

t riﬁed Hans, glided swiftly away to rejoin her
com

panions .

“Jufv rouw, j ufv r ouw van Gleck !

” called Hans, in a

loud tone, stumbling after her as well as he could ;
for

one of his skate-Strings w as untied .

Hilda turned , and , with one hand raised to shield her

eyes from the sun, seemed to him to be ﬂoating through
the air, nearer and nearer .

“We cannot take this money,
panted Hans,
though

we know your goodness in giving it .

”

“ Why not, indeed ?

” asked Hilda, ﬂushing .

Because,

” replied Hans , bowing like a clown, but

looking with the eye of a prince at the queenly girl,

“ we

have not earned it .

”

Hilda
w as quick-witted .
She had noticed a pretty

wooden chain upon Gretel

’s neck .

32
HANS
BRINKER

Oh !

” cried Gretel , in real dismay .
Not buy the

skates .
Why, I am not often cold .
Mother says the

blood runs up and down in poor children

’s veins, hum

ming,

‘ I must keep

’em warm ; I must keep

’em warm

“O Hans !

” she continued , with something like a sob ,

don

’t say you won

’t buy the skates : it makes me feel

just like crying .
Besides , I want to be cold

— I mean

I

’m real, awful warm

—
so, now !

”

Hans looked up hurriedly .
He had a true Dutch hor

ror of tears, or emotion of any kind ;
and , most of all ,

he dreaded to see his sister

’s blue eyes overﬂowing .

“ Now mind ,

”
cried
Gretel,
seeing her
advantage,

“ I

’ll feel awful if you give up the skates .
I don

’t want

them : I

’m not such a stingy as that .
But I want you

to h ave them ;
and then, when I get bigger, they

’ll do

for me .
Oh-h ! count the pieces, Hans .
Did ever you

see so many ?

”

Hans turned the money thoughtfully in his palm .

Never in all his life had he longed so intensely for a
pair of skates ;
for he had known of the race, and had ,

boylike, fairly ached for a chance to test his powers with
the other children .
He felt conﬁdent that, with a good

pair of steel runners, he could readily distance most of
the boys on the canal .
Then, too, Gretel

’s argument

w as so plausible .
On the other hand , he knew that she,

with her strong but lithe little frame, needed but a
week

’s practice on good runners to make her a better

skater than Rychie Korbes , or even Katrinka Flack .

33

As soon as this last thought ﬂashed upon him, his
t e

solve was made .
If Gretel would not have the jacket,

she should have the skates .

“No, Gretel,

” he answered at last,
I can wait .
Some

day I may have money enough saved to buy a ﬁne pair .
You shall have these .

”

Gretel

’s eyes sparkled ;
but, in another instant, she

insisted rather faintly,

“The young lady gave the money to you, Hans .
I

’d

be real bad to take it .

”

Hans shook his head resolutely as he trudged on, caus

ing his sister to half skip and half walk in her effort to
keep beside him .
By this time they had taken
off their

wooden

“ rockers,
and were hastening home to tell their

mother the good news .

“ Oh ,
I know !

”
cried Gretel, in a sprightly tone .

You can do this .
You
c an get a pair a little too small

for you , and too big for me ; and w e can take turns, and
use them .
Won

’t that be ﬁne ?

” and Gretel clapped

her hands again .

Poor Hans !
This was a strong temptation ;
but he

pushed it away from him , brave-hearted fellow that he was .

“ Nonsense, Gretel !
You could never get on with a

big pair :
you stumbled about with these like a blind

chicken, before I curved
off the ends .
No :
you must

have a pair to ﬁt exactly ; and you must practise every
chance you
c an get until the
20th comes .
My little

Gretel shall win the silver skates .

”

34
HANS BRINKER

Gretel could not help laughing with delight at the

very idea .

“ Hans, Gretel !
called out a familiar voice .

Coming, mother .

” And they hastened toward the cot

tage, Hans still shaking the pieces of silver in his hand .

On the following day there w a s not a prouder nor a

happier boy in all Holland than Hans Brinker, as he
watched his
Sister, with many a dexterous sweep , ﬂying

in and out among the skaters wh o at sundown thronged
the canal .
A warm j acket had been given her by the

kind-hearted Hilda ;
and the burst-out shoes had been

cobbled into decency by Dame Brinker .
As the little

creature darted backward and forward , ﬂushed with
en

j oym ent, and quite unconscious of the many wondering
glances bent upon her, she felt that the shining runners
beneath her feet had suddenly turned eart

‘h into fairy

land , while

“ Hans, dear, good Hans !

” echoed itself over

and over again in her grateful heart .

By den donder !

” exclaimed Peter
v an Holp to Carl

Schummel,
but that little one in the red jacket and

patched petticoat skates well .
Gunst ! she has toes on

her heels , and eyes in the back of her head .
See her !

It will be a joke if she gets in the race, and beats K a
trinka Flack, after all .

”

“ Hush
not so loud
returned Carl, rather sneeringly .

That little lady in rags is the special pet of Hilda
v an

Gleck .
Those shining
sk ates

/ ar e her gift, if I make no

mistake .

SO , so !

” exclaimed Peter, with a radiant smile ; for

Hilda was his best friend .

“ She has been at her good

work there too
And Mynheer v an Holp , after cutting

a double 8 on the ice, to say nothing of a huge P, then a
jump, and an H, glided onward until he found himself
beside Hilda .

Hand in hand , they skated together, laughingly at

ﬁrst, then staidly talking in a low tone .

Strange to say, Peter
v an Holp soon arrived at a sud

den conviction that his little sister needed
a wooden

chain just like Hilda

’s .

Two days afterward , on St . Nicholas Ev e, Hans, hav

ing burned three candle-ends , and
cut his thumb into the

bargain, stood in the market-place at Amsterdam , buy
ing another pair of skates .

SHADOWS IN THE HOME

GOOD Dame Brinker !
As soon as the scanty dinner

had been cleared away that noon, she had arrayed her
self in her holiday attire in honor of St . Nicholas .

“ It

will brighten the children,

” she thought to herself; and

she was not mistaken .
This festival dress had been

worn very seldom during the past ten years : before that
time it had done good service, and had ﬂourished at
many a dance and her mis, when she was known , far and
wide, as the pretty M eitj e K lenck .
The children had

sometimes been granted rare glimpses of it as it lay in
state in the old oaken chest .
Faded and threadbare as

it w as, it w as gorgeous in their eyes, with its white linen
tucker, now gathered to her plump throat,
and vanishing

beneath the trim bodice of blue homespun, and its red
dish
brown
skirt
bordered with

. black .
The knitted

woollen mitts, and the dainty cap showing her hair,
which generally w as hidd eh , made her seem almost like

a princess to Gretel ; while Master Hans grew staid and
well-behaved as he gazed .

Soon the little maid , while braiding her own golden

tresses , fairly danced around her mother in an ecstasy
of admiration .

“ 0 mother, mother, mother ! how pretty you are !

Look, Hans ! isn

’t it just like a picture ? ”

“ Just like a picture,

”
assented Hans, cheerfully,

j ur t like a picture ;
Only I don

things on the hands .

“ Not like the mitts, Brother Hans ! why, they

See, they cover up all the red .
O mother !

“ This

much thicker about the waist than a churn-dasher,

said Dame Brinker, adding,

“ And how do you like the

c ap ?

” as she turned her head from side to side .

Oh , ever so much , mother !

” said Gretel .

“ It

’s beau

tiful !
See, the father is looking !

”

Was the father looking ?
Alas ! only with a dull stare .

His
ar ouse turned toward him with a start , a question

ing sparkle in her eye .
The bright look died away in

an instant

“No,

she
sighed :

Sees

Come,

“ don

“ Yes ;

laughed
Gretel

We

’ll race on the canal to-night, if the mother lets us .

At the very threshold he turned to say,

“ Your spin

ning-wheel wants a new treadle, mother .

”

“ You can make it , Hans .

”

So I can .
Th at will take no money .
But you need

feathers and wool and meal, and

“There, there ! that will do .

everything .
Ah , Hans ! if our stolen money would but

Only last night, I prayed to the good saint

“ Mother !

Why not, Hans ?
Shame on you to reproach me for

lady that walks into church ; but it

’s no wrong to turn

Hans knew his mother too well to oppose her when

her voice quickened and sharpened as it often did when
she spoke of the missing money ; so he said gently,

“ And what did you ask of good St . Nicholas, mother ?

from a potato .
When he came in that dreadful night

to supper, he handed the Watch to me, and told me to
take good care of it until he asked for it again .
Just

as he opened his lips to say more, Broom K latterb oost
came ﬂying in with word that the dike w as in danger .
Ah ! the waters were terrible that holy Pinxter—week .
My man, alack ! caught up his tools , and ran out .
That

wa s the last I ever saw of him in his right mind .
He

w as brought in again by midnight , nearly dead , with
his poor head all bruised and cut .
The fever passed

off in time, but never the dulness :
that grew worse every

day .
We shall never know .

”

Hans had heard all this before .
More than once he

had seen his mother, in hours of sore need , take the
watch from its hiding-place, half resolved to sell it : but
she had always conquered the temptation .

“ No, Hans !

” she would say,

“ w e must be nearer

starving than this before w e turn faithless to the father .

”

A memory of some such scene came to the boy

’s mind

now ; for, after giving a heavy
Sigh , and ﬁlliping a crumb

of w ax at Gretel across the table, he said ,

“ Ay, mother, you have done bravely to keep it : many

a one would have tossed it
off for gold long ago .

”

“ And more shame for them !

” exclaimed the dame,

indignantly .
I would not do it .
Besides , the gentry

thing in our hands , even if we told all, they might sus

Hans ﬂushed angrily .

“ They would not dar e to say such a thing, mother !

Of his sentence was too terrible to utter in her pres

ence .

Dame Brinker smiled proudly through her tears at

this interruption .

“ Ah , Hans ! thou

We will never

In his dying hour the

dear father might wake, and ask for it .

“ Might

” echoed Hans,

“ Ay, child ,
almost whispered his mother

”

By this time Hans had nearly forgotten his proposed

errand to Amsterdam .
His mother had seldom spoken

so familiarly with him .
He felt himself now to be not

only her son, but her friend , her adviser .

“ You are right, mother .
We must never give up the

watch .
For the father

’s sake, we will guard it always .

The money, though , may come to light when we least
expect it .

”

“Never !

from her needle with a jerk, and laying the unﬁnished
knitting heavily upon her lap .

“ There is no chance .

If they went in an evil way, the thief would have con

“ He may not be dead yet,

Every

Sometimes, at supper, the father and I

would talk about a new chimney, and a good winter
room for the cow ; but my man , forsooth , had ﬁner plans
even than that .

‘ A big sail,

’ says he,

‘ catches the wind

w e can do what we will soon,

’ and then we would sing

together as I washed my dishes .
Ah ,

‘ a smooth sea

makes an easy rudder .

’
Not a thing vexed me from

morning till night .
Every week the father would take

Out the stocking, and drop in the money, and laugh ,
and kiss me, as w e tied it up together .

—
Up with you,

Hans ! there you sit gaping, and the day
a-wasting !

”

added Dame Brinker, tartly, blushing to ﬁnd that she
had been speaking too freely to her boy .

“ It

’s high

time you were on your way .

”

Hans had seated himself, and was looking earnestly

into her face .
He arose, and , in almost a whisper,

asked ,

“ Have you ever tr ied, mother ?
She understood him .

Yes , child , often .
But the father only laughs ;
or

he stares at me so strange, I am glad to ask no more .
When you and Gretel had the fever last winter, and our
bread was nearly gone, and I could earn nothing, for
fear you would die while my face was turned , oh , I tried
then !
I smoothed his hair, and whispered to him soft

as a kitten, about the money,

— where it was, wh o had

44
HANS BRINKER

it ?
Alack ! he would pick at my sleeve, and whisper

gibberish till my blood ran cold .
At last, while Gretel

lay whiter than snow, and you were raving on the bed ,
I
scr eamed to him,

— it seemed as if he must hear me,

‘ Raff, where is our money ?
Do you know aught of the

money, Raff

—
the money in the pouch and the stock

ing, in the big chest ?

’
But I might as well have talked

to a stone : I might as

The mother

’s voice sounded so strangely, and her eye

was so bright , that Hans, with a new anxiety, laid his
hand upon her shoulder .

“ Come, mother,

” he said ,
let us try to forget this

money .
I am big and strong : Gretel, too, is very quick

and willing .
Soon all will be prosperous with us again .

Why, mother ! Gretel and I would rather see thee bright
and happy than to have all the silver in the world .
Wouldn

’t w e, Gretel ?

“ The mother knows it,
said Gretel, sobbing .

VI

SUNB EAM S

DAME BRINKER was startled at her children

’s emotion,

glad , too, for it proved how loving and true they

were .

Beautiful ladies in princely homes often smile sud

d enly and sweetly, gladdening the very air around them ;
but I doubt if their smile be more welcome in God

’s

sight than that which sprang forth to cheer the roughly
clad boy and girl in the humble cottage .
Dame Brinker

felt that she had been selﬁsh .
Blushing and brighten

ing, she hastily wiped h er eyes, and looked upon them
as only a mother can .

“ Hoity, toity !
Pretty talk we

’re having, and St .

Nicholas
Eve
almost
here !
What wonder
the
yarn

pricks my ﬁngers !
Come, Gretel, take this cent ;

1 and ,

while Hans is trading for the skates , you can buy a
wafﬂe in the market-place .

”

“ Let me stay home with you , mother,
said Gretel,

1 The Dutch cent is worth less than half of an American cent .

46
HANS
BRINKER

looking up with eyes that sparkled through their tears .

“ Hans will buy me the cake .

”

As you will, child .
And , Hans

— wait a moment .

Three turns of the needle will ﬁnish this toe ;
and then

you may have as good a pair of hose as ever was knitted

(owning the yarn is a grain too sharp) to sell to the h o
sier on the Heir een Gracht . 1
That will give us three

quarter-guilders , if you make good trade ;
and , as it

’s

right hungry weather, you may buy four w aﬂi es .
We

’ll

keep the Feast of St . Nicholas, after all .

”

Gretel clapped her hands .

“ That will be ﬁne !
Annie

Bouman told me wh at grand times they will have in
the big houses to-night .
But
we
Shall be merry too .

Hans will have beautiful new skates ,

—
and then there

’ll

be
the
wafﬂes !
Oh -h !
Don

’t
break
them ,
Brother

Hans .
Wrap them well, and button them under your

jacket very carefully .

”

“ Certainly,

” replied Hans,
quite gruff with pleasure

and importance .

O mother !

” cried Gretel, in high glee,
soon you will

be busied with the father, and now you are only knit
ting .
Do tell us all about St . Nicholas .

”

Dame Brinker laughed to see Hans hang up his hat,

and prepare to listen .
Nonsense, children !

” she said .

“ I have told it to you often .

”

“Tell us again ! oh , d o tell us

. again !

” cried Gretel,

throwing herself upon the wonderful wooden bench that

1 A street in Amsterdam .

HANS BRINKER

and all their beautiful clothes himself ?
So that night,

when all the world w as asleep , he got up and killed the
three young gentlemen .

Gretel clasped her hands and shuddered ;
but Hans

tried to look as if killing and murder were every-day
matters to him .

“That
w as not the worst
of it,
continued Dame

Brinker, knitting slowly, and trying to keep count of
her stitches as she talked :

“ that was not near the worst

of it .
The dreadful landlord went and cut up the young

gentlemen

’s bodies into little pieces, and threw them

into a great tub of brine, intending to sell them for
pickled pork .

”

“ Oh !

” cried Gretel, horror-stricken, though
Sh e had

often heard the story before .
Hans still continued
u n

moved , and seemed to think that pickling was the best
that could be done under the circumstances .

“ Yes, he pickled them ;
and one might think that

would have been the last of the young gentlemen .
But

no .
That night St . Nicholas had a wonderful vision ;

and in it he saw th e landlord cutting up the merchant

’s

children .
There w as no need of his hurrying, you know,

for he was a saint ;
but in the morning he went to the

inn, and charged the landlord with the murder .
Then

the wicked landlord confessed it from beginning to end ,
and fell down on his knees, begging forgiveness .
He felt

so sorry for what he h ad done, that he asked the saint
to bring the young masters to life .

”

SUNBEAMS
49

And did the saint do it ?

” asked Gretel, delighted ,

well knowing what the answer would be .

“ Of course he did .
The pickled pieces ﬂew together

in a ﬂash ,
and out jumped the young gentlemen from the

brine-tub .
They cast themselves
at the
feet of St .

Nicholas , and he gave them his blessing and— oh mercy
on us Hans ! it will bedark before you get back if you
don

’t start this minute .

By this time Dame Brinker was almost out of breath ,

and quite out of commas .
She
could

~ not remember

when she had seen the children idle away an hour of
daylight in this manner, and the thought of such luxury
quite appalled her .
By w ay of compensation, she now

ﬂew about the room in extreme haste .
Tossing a block

of peat upon the ﬁre, blowing invisible dust from the
table, and handing the ﬁnished hose to Hans, all in an
instant ,

“ Come, Hans,
she said , as her boy lingered by the

door,

“ what keeps thee ?

”

Hans kissed his mother

’s plump Cheek, rosy and fresh

yet , in spite of all her troubles .
My mother is the best

in the world , and I would be right glad to have a pair
of skates ;
but

”

—
and , as he buttoned his j acket, he

looked , in
a troubled way, toward
a
strange ﬁgure

crouching by the hearthstone—
“ if my money would

bring a meester 1 from Amsterdam to see the father, some
thing might yet be done .

”

1 Doctor (dokter in Dutch) called meester by the lower class.

50
HANS
BRINKER

A
meester would not come, Hans, for twice that

money ;
and it would do no good , if he did .
Ah , how

many guilders I once spent for that !
But the dear,

good father would not waken .
It is God

’s will .
Go,

Hans, and buy the skates .

”

Hans started with a heavy heart ; but since the heart

w as young, and in a boy

’s bosom , it set him whistling

in less than ﬁv e minutes .
His mother had said

“ thee

to him ; and that was quite enough to make even a dark
day sunny .
Hollanders do not address each other in

affectionate intercourse, as the French and Germans do .
But Dame Brinker had embroidered for a Heidelberg
family in her girlhood ;
and she had carried its
thee

”

and

“ thou

” into her rude home, to be used in moments

of extreme love and tenderness .

Therefore,

“ What keeps thee, Hans ?

” sang an echo

song beneath the boy

’s whistling, and made him feel

that his errand was blest .

VII

H

'
A S
HIS W AY

BROEK, with its quiet, spotless streets , its frozen riv

ulets, its
yellow brick pavements, and bright wooden

houses , w as near by .
It was a village where neatness

and show were in full blossom ;
but the inhabitants

seemed to be either asleep or dead .

Not a footprint marred the sanded paths , where p eh

bles and sea-shells lay in fanciful designs .
Every window

shutter was closed as tightly as though
air and sun

shine were poison ;
and the massive front doors were

never opened , except on the occasion of a wedding, a
christening or a funeral .

Serene clouds of tobacco-smoke were ﬂoating through

hidden apartments ;
and children , wh o otherwise might

have awakened the place, were studying in out-of-the

w ay corners , or skating upon the neighboring canal .
A

few peacocks and wolves stood in the gardens ; but they
had never enjoyed the luxury of ﬂesh and blood .
They

were
cut out in growing box, and seemed guarding the

5 1

52
HANS
BRINKER

grounds with a sort of green ferocity .
Certain lively

automata

—
ducks, women and sportsmen

— were stowed

away
in
summer-houses, waiting
for the
springtime,

when they could be wound up , and rival their owners in
animation ;
and the shining, tiled roofs, mosaic court

yards and polished house-trimmings, ﬂashed up a silent
homage to the sky, where never a speck of dust could
dwell .

Hans glanced toward the village, as he shook his silver

hwa r tj es, and wondered whether it were really true, as
he had often heard , that some of the people of Broek
were so rich that they used kitchen utensils of solid gold .

He had seen M ev r ouw van Stoop

’s sweet cheeses in

market, and he knew that the lofty dame earned many
a bright silver guilder in selling them .
But

“ did she

set the cream to rise in golden pans ?
Did she use a

golden skimmer ?
When her cows were in winter-quar

ters, were their tails really tied up with ribbons ?

”

These thoughts ran through his mind as he turned

his face toward Amsterdam , not ﬁve miles away, on the
other side of the frozen Y . 1
The ice upon the canal was

perfect ;
but his wooden runners , so soon to be cast

aside, squeaked a dismal farewell, as he scraped and
skimmed along .

When crossing the Y, whom should he see skating

toward him, but the great Dr . Bockman, the most fa
mous physician and surgeon in Holland
Hans had never

1 P ronounced eye, an arm of the Zuyder-Zee .

HANS
HAS HIS WAY
53

met him before ; but he had seen his engraved likeness
in many of the shop-windows of Amsterdam .
It w as a

face that one could never forget .
Thin and lank, though

a born Dutchman , with stem
blue eyes , and queer,

compressed lips, that seemed to say,

“ No smiling
al

lowed ,

” he certainly
w as not a very jolly or sociable

looking
personage,
not one
that
a
well-trained
boy

would care to accost unbidden .

But Hans was hidd en, and that, too, by a voice he

seldom disregarded ,

—his own conscience .

Here comes the greatest doctor in the world ,
whis

pered the voice .

“ God has sent him .
You have no

right to buy skates, when you might, with the same
money, purchase such aid for your father .

”

The wooden runners gave an exultant squeak .
Hun

dreds of beautiful skates were gleaming and vanishing
in the air above him .
He felt
the money tingle in his

ﬁngers .
The old doctor looked fearfully grim and for

bidding .
Hans

’ heart was in his throat ;
but he found

voice enough to
cry out, just as he was passing,

“ Mynheer Boekm an
The great man halted , and , sticking out his thin

under-lip , looked scowlingly about him .

Hans w as in for it now .

“ Mynheer,

” he panted , drawing close to the ﬁerce

looking doctor,

“ I knew you could be none other than

the famous Bockman .
I have to ask a great favor

“ Humph !

” muttered the doctor, preparing to skate

54
HANS
BRINKER

past the intruder .
Get out of the way

—
I

’

v e no money

never give to beggars .

“ I am no beggar, mynheer,
retorted Hans , proudly,

at the same time producing his mite of silver with a
grand
air .

“ I wish to consult with you
about my

father .
He is a living man, but sits like one dead .
He

cannot even think ;
and his words mean nothing .
But

he is not sick .
He fell on the dikes .

”

“ Hey ? what ?

” cried the doctor, beginning to listen .

Hans told the whole story in an incoherent w ay, dash

ing off a tear once or twice as he talked , and ﬁnally end
ing with an earnest,

Oh , do see him, mynheer !
His body is well :
it is

only his mind .
I know this money is not enough ; but

take it, mynheer .
I shall earn more, I know I shall .

Oh , I will toil for you all my life, if you will but cure
my father !

”

What w as the matter with the old doctor ?
A bright

ness like sunlight beamed from his face .
His eyes were

kind and moist .
The hand that had lately clutched his

cane, as if preparing to strike,
was laid gently upon

Hans

’ shoulder .

“ Put up your money, boy, I do not want it .
We

will see your father .
It is a hopeless case, I fear .
How

long did you say ?

”

“ Ten years, mynheer,
sobbed Hans , radiant with

sudden hope .

Ah ! a bad case .
But I shall see him .
Let me

VIII

INTRODUCING JACOB POOT AND HIS COUSIN

HANS and Gretel had a ﬁne frolic early on that St .

Nicholas Eve .
There w a s a bright moon ;
and their

mother, though she believed herself to be without any
hope of her husband

’s improvement, h ad been made so

happy at the prospect of the meester

’
s visit, that she had

yielded to the children

’s entreaties for an hour

’s skating

before bed-time .

Hans was delighted with his new
Skates ;
and , in his

eagerness to show Gretel how perfectly they

“ worked ,

”

did many things upon the ice that caused the little maid
to clasp her hands in solemn admiration .
They were

not alone, though they seemed quite unheeded by the
various groups assembled upon the canal .

The two Van Holp s and Carl Schummel were there,

testing their ﬂeetness to the utmost .
Out of four trials,

Peter
v an Holp had beaten three times .
Consequently,

Carl, never very amiable, w as in anything but a good

JACOB POOT
AND HIS COUSIN
57

humor .
He had
relieved himself by taunting young

Schimmelp ennick, wh o , being smaller than the others ,
kept meekly near them , without feeling exactly like one
of the party .
But now a new thought seized Carl ; or,

rather, he seized the new thought, and made an onset
upon his friends .

“ I say, boys , let

’s put a stop to those young rag

pickers from the idiot

’s cottage joining the race .
Hilda

must be crazy to think of it .
Katrinka Flack and

Rychie Korbes are furious at the very idea of racing with
the girl ;
and , for my part , I don

’t blame them .
As

for the boy, if we

’ve a spark of manhood in us , w e will

scorn the very idea
of

“ Certainly we will,
interposed Peter van Holp , pur

p osely mistaking
Carl

’s
meaning .

“ Who
doubts
it ?

No fellow with a spark of manhood in him would refuse
to let in two good skaters , just because they were poor .

”

Carl wheeled about savagely .

“ Not so fast , master !
And I

’d thank you not to put

words in other people

’s mouths .
You

’d best not try it

again .

”

“ Ha, ha !
laughed little Voostenw alb ert Schimmel

pennick, delighted at the prospect of a ﬁght, and sure
that , if it should come to blows , his favorite Peter could
beat a dozen excitable fellows like Carl .

Something in Peter

’s eye made Carl glad to turn to a

weaker offender .
He wheeled furiously upon Voost .

“What are you shrieking about , you little weasel ?

5s
HANS
BRINKER

You skinny herring, you !
you little monkey with a

long name for a tail !

Half a dozen bystanders and byskater s set up an
ap

plauding shout at this brave witticism ;
and Carl, feel

ing that he had fairly vanquished his foes, was restored
to
partial good humor .
He, however,
prudently
t e

solved to defer plotting against Hans and Gretel until
some time when Peter should not be present .

Just then his friend Jacob Poot was seen approach

ing .
They could not distinguish his features at ﬁrst ;

but , as he was the stoutest boy in the neighborhood ,
there could be no mistaking his form .

“ Halloo ! here comes Fatty !

” exclaimed Carl .
And

there

’s
some
one
with
him ,

- a
slender
fellow,
a

stranger .

”

“ Ha, ha ! that

’s like good bacon,
cried Ludwig,
a

streak of lean and a streak of fat

“ That

’s Jacob

’s English cousin,
put in Master Voost,

delighted at being able to give the information .

“ That

’s

his English cousin ; and , oh , he

’s got such a funny little

name

—
Ben Dobbs
He

’s going to stay with him until

after the grand race .

All this time the boys had been spinning, turning,
rolling,

” and doing other feats upon their skates in a

quiet
w ay, as they talked ;
but now they stood still,

bracing themselves against the frosty air, as Jacob Foot
and his friend drew near .

This is my cousin , boys ,
said Jacob , rather out of

JACOB POOT AND HIS COUSIN
59

breath ,
Benjamin Dobbs
He

’s a John
Bull ;
and

he

’s going to be in the race .
All
crowded ,
boy-fashion ,
about
the
new-comers .

Benjamin soon made up his mind that
th e Hollanders ,

notwithstanding their queer gibberish , were a ﬁne set
of fellows .

If the truth must be told , Jacob had announced his

cousin as

“ Pench amin Dopps ,

” and called him a

“ Shon

Pull ;

” but , as I translate every word of the conversa

tion of our young friends , it is no more than fair to mend
their little attempts at English .
Master Dobbs felt at

ﬁrst
decidedly
awkward
among
his
cousin

’s
friends .

Though most of them had studied English and French ,
they were shy about attempting to speak either ; and he
made very funny blunders when he tried to converse in
Dutch
He had learned that vr ouw means

“wife ;

” and j a ,

“ yes ;
and sp oor weg,

“ railway ;

” ka na als ,

“ canals ;
stoom

boot,

“ steamboat ;

”

opha albr uggeu ,

“ drawbridges ;
huiten

pla sters,

“ country-seats ;

”
mynheer ,
mister ;
tweegevegt,

duel,

” or

“ two-ﬁgh ts ;

” hop er ,

“ copper ;

”

z adel ,

“ saddle

but he could not make a sentence out of these, nor use
the long list of phrases he had learned in his

“ Dutch

Dialogues .

”
The topics of the latter were ﬁne, but were

never alluded to by the boys .
Like the poor fellow who

had learned in

“ Ollendo rﬂ

'
to ask in faultless German ,

Have you seen my grandmother

’s red cow
and , when

he reached Germany, discovered that he had no occasion
to

. inquire after that interesting animal, Ben found that

60
HANS
BRINKER

his book Dutch did not avail him as much as he had
hoped .
He acquired a hearty contempt for Jan van Gorp ,

a Hollander who wrote a book in Latin to prove that
Adam and Eve spoke Dutch ; and he smiled a knowing
smile when his Uncle Poot assured him that Dutch

“ had

great likeness mit Zinglish ; but it vash much petter lan
guish , much petter .

”

However, the fun of skating glides over all barriers

of speech .
Through this, Ben soon felt that he knew

the boys well ;
and , when Jacob (with a sprinkling of

French and English for Ben

’s beneﬁt) told of a grand

project they had planned , his cousin could now and
then put in a j a , or a nod , in quite a familiar w ay

.

The project was a grand one, and there was to be a

ﬁne opportunity for carrying it out ;
for, besides the

allotted holiday of the Festival of St . Nicholas , four
extra days were to be allowed for a general cleaning of
the schoolhouse .

Jacob and Ben had obtained permission to go on a

long skating-journey ;
no less a one than from B roek

to the Hague, the capital of Holland ,

— a distance of

nearly ﬁfty miles . 1

“ And now, boys ,
added Jacob when he had told the

plan,

“ who will go with us ?

”

“ I will, I will
cried the boys , eagerly .

And so will I ,
ventured little Voostenw alb ert .

1 Throughout this nar rative, distances
are given according to
ou r
standa rd ,

—the English
statute mile of
feet .
The Dutch mile is more than four

times as long
as ou rs .

JACOB POOT
AND HIS COUSIN
6 1

Ha, ha !
laughed Jacob , holding his fat sides , and

shaking his
puffy
cheeks .

“ You
go ?
Such
a
little

fellow as you !
Why, youngster, you haven

’t left
off

your pads yet !

Now, in Holland , very young children wear a thin,

padded cushion around their heads , surmounted with a
framework of whalebone and ribbon , to protect them in
case of a fall ; and it is the dividing-line between baby
hood and childhood when they leave it
oﬂ

'

.
Voost had

arrived
at this
dignity
several years
before ;
conse

quently Jacob

’s insult was rather too great for endur

ance .

“ Look out what you say !
he squeaked .
Lucky for

you when you can leave
off your pads .
You

’re padded

all over

“ Ha, ha !

” roared all the boys except Master Dobbs,

who could not understand

“ Ha, h a !

” and the good

natured Jacob laughed more than any

“ It ish my fat

— yaw

—
h e say I bees pad mit fat !

he explained to Ben .

So a vote w as passed unanimously in favor of allow

ing the now popular Voost to join the party, if his par
ents would consent .

“ Good-night
sang out the happy youngster, skating

homeward with all his might .

Good-night
We
c a n stop
at Haarlem , Jacob , and
Show your

cousin the big organ ,
said Peter
v an Holp,
eagerly ;

62
HANS BRINKER

and at Leyden , too, where there

’s no end to the sights ;

and spend a day and night at the Hague, for my mar
ried sister, wh o lives there, will be delighted to see us ;
and the next morning w e can start for home .

”

“All right,
responded Jacob , who was not much of

a talker .

Ludwig had been regarding his brother with
enth u si

astic admiration .

“ Hurrah for you , Pete !
It takes you to make plans .

M oth er

’ll
be
as
full
of it
as we are, when we tell

her
we can take her love direct to Sister van Gend .

My ! but it

’s cold ,
he added ,

—
“ cold enough to take

a
fellow

’s
head
off
his
shoulders .
We

’d
better
go

home .

”

“What if it is cold , old tender-skin
cried Carl, wh o

was busily practising a step which he called the

“ double

edge .

”
“ Great skating we should have by this time, if

it was as warm as it was last December .
Don

’t you

know if it wasn

’t an extra cold winter, and an early one,

into the bargain, we couldn

’t go ?

”

“ I know it

’s an extra cold night, anyhow,
said Lud

wig

.

“ Whew, I

’m going home !

”

Peter
v an Holp took out a bulgy gold watch , and ,

holding it toward the moonlight as well as his benumbed
ﬁngers would permit , called out,

“ Halloo, it

’s nearly eight o

’clock !
St . Nicholas is

about by this time ;
and I , for one, want to see the

little ones stare .
Good-night

IX

THE FESTIVAL OF ST . NICHOLAS

WE all know how, before the Christmas-tree began

ﬂourish in the home-life of our country, a certain

“ right

jolly old elf,

” with
eight tiny reindeer,

” used to drive

his sleigh-load of toys up to our housetops, and then
bound down the chimney to ﬁll the stockings so hope
fully hung by the ﬁreplace .
His friends called him

Santa Claus ;
and those wh o were most intimate
v en

tu r ed to say,

“Old Nick .

”
It was said that he origi

nally came from Holland .
Doubtless he did ; but, if so,

he certainly, like many other foreigners, changed his
ways very much
after landing upon our shores .
In

Holland , St . Nicholas is a veritable saint, and often
ap

pears in full costume, with his embroidered robes glit
tering with gems and gold , his mitre, his crosier, and his
jewelled
gloves .
Her e
Santa
Claus
comes
rollicking

along on the
25th of December, our holy Christmas

morn ; but in Holland , St . Nicholas visits earth on the

sth , a time especially appropriated to him .
Early on

THE FESTIVAL OF ST . NICHOLAS
65

the morning of the 6th , which is St . Nicholas Day, he
distributes his candies , toys and treasures, and then
vanishes for a year .

Christmas
Day
is
devoted
by
the
Hollanders
to

church-rites and pleasant family visiting .
It is on St .

Nicholas Eve that their young people become half wild
with joy and expectation .
To some of them it is a

sorry time ;
for the saint is very candid , and , if any of

them have been bad during the past year, he is quite
sure to tell them so .
Sometimes he carries a birch-rod

under his arm , and advises the parents to give them
scoldings in place of confections, and ﬂoggings instead
of toys .

It was well that the boys hastened to their abodes

on that bright winter evening ; for, in less than an hour
afterwards , the saint made his appearance in half the
homes of Holland .
He visited the king

’s palace, and in

the selfsame moment appeared in Annie B oum an

’

s com

fo rt able home .
Probably one of our silver half-dollars

would have purchased all that his saintship left at the
peasant B oum an

’

s .
But a half-dollar

per .
Hilda
was
as joyous
as
any .
Why
not ?
St .

Nicholas would never cross a girl of fourteen from his
list, just because she w as tall and looked almost like a
woman .
On the contrary, he would probably exert him

self to do honor to such an august-looking damsel .
Who

could tell ?
So she sported and laughed and danced as

gayly as the youngest, and was the soul of all their
merry games .
Father, mother and grandmother looked

on approvingly ; so did grandfather, before he spread his
large red handkerchief over his face, leaving only the
top of his
Skullcap visible .
This kerchief was his ensign

of sleep .

Earlier in the evening, all had joined in the fun .
In

the general hilarity, there had seemed to be a difference
only in bulk between grandfather and the baby .
In

deed , a sh ade of solemn expectation,
now
and then

ﬂitting across the faces of the younger members , had
made
them seem rather more thoughtful than their

elders .

Now the spirit of fun reigned supreme .
Th e very

ﬂames danced and capered in the polished grate .
A

pair of prim candles, that had been staring at the astral
lamp , began to wink at other candles far away in the
mirrors .
There
w as a long bell-rope suspended from

the ceiling in the corner, made of glass beads, netted
over a cord nearly as thick as your wrist .
It generally

hung in the shadow, and made no
Sign ;
but to-night

it twinkled from end to end .

glass sent reckless dashes of red at the papered wall,
turning its dainty blue stripes into purple .
Passers-by

halted to catch the merry laughter ﬂoating through cur
tain
and

‘

s ash i nto the street, then skipped on their way

with the startled consciousness that the village was wide
awake .
At last matters grew so uproarious that the

grandsire

’s red kerchief came down from his face with

a jerk .
What decent old gentleman could sleep in such

a racket !
Mynheer van
Gleck regarded his children

with astonishment .
The baby even
Showed symptoms

of hysterics .
It was high time to attend to business .

M ev r ouw suggested that , if they wished to see the good
St . Nicholas , they should sing the same loving invitation
that had brought him the year before .

The baby stared , and thrust his ﬁst into his mouth ,

as mynheer put him down upon the ﬂoor .
Soon he sat

erect, and looked with a sweet scowl at the company .
With his lace and embroideries, and his crown of blue
ribbon and whalebone (for he
w as not quite past the

tumbling age) , he looked like the king of the babies .

The
other children,
each
holding
a
pretty willow

basket, formed at once in a ring, and moved slowly
around the little fellow, lifting their eyes meanwhile ;
for the saint to whom they were about to address them
selves was yet in mysterious quarters .

M ev r ouw commenced playing softly upon the piano ;

soon the voices rose,

-gentle, youthful voices, rendered

all the sweeter for their tremor,

68
HANS
BRINKER

Welcome, friend !
St . Nichola s, wel come !

While o ur voices bid thee welcome,

Every heart with j oy is light .

Tell

Fill each empty hand and ba sket ;

’Tis thy little ones who

Thou Wilt b ring u s everything !

During the chorus , sundry glances, half in eagerness,

half in dread , had been cast toward the polished fold
ing-doors .
Now a loud knocking was heard .
The Circle

w a s broken in an instant .
Some of the little ones, with

a strange mixture of fear and delight, pressed against
their mother

’s knee .
Grandfather bent forward , with

his chin resting upon his hand ; grandmother lifted her
spectacles ; Mynheer
v an Gleck, seated by the ﬁreplace,

slowly drew his meerschaum from his mouth ;
while

Hilda and the other children settled themselves beside
him in an expectant group .

The knocking was heard again .

“ Come in,

” said the mev rouw, softly .

THE FESTIVAL
OF ST
. NICHOLAS
69

The door slowly opened ;
and St . Nicholas, in full

array, stood before them .
You could have heard a pin

drop .
Soon he spoke .
What a mysterious majesty in

his voice ! what kindliness in his tones !

“ Karel v an

’
Gleck, I am pleased to greet thee, and thy

honored
vr ouw, Kathrine, and thy son, and his good

w ouw, Annie .

“ Children , I greet ye all,

— Hendrick, Hilda, Broom ,

Katy, Huygens and Lucretia .
And thy cousins ,

— Wol

fert, Diedrich , M ayken, Voost and Katrina .
Good chil

dren ye have been, in the main , since I last accosted ye .
Diedrich was rude at the Haarlem fair last fall ; but he
has tried to
atone for it since .
M ayken has failed , of

late, in her lessons ; and too many sweets and t riﬂes have
gone to her lips, and too few stivers to her charity-box .
Diedrich , I trust, will be a polite, manly boy for the
future ; and M ayken will endeavor to shine as a student .
Let her remember, too, that economy and thrift are
needed in the foundation of a worthy and generous life .
Little Katy has been cruel to the cat more than once .
St . Nicholas can hear the
c at
cry when its tail is pulled .

I will forgive her, if
Sh e will remember from this hour

that the smallest dumb creatures have feeling, and must
not be abused .

”

As Katy burst into a frightened cry, the saint gra

ciou sly remained silent until she w a s soothed .

“ Master Broom ,

” he resumed ,

“ I warn thee that boys

who are in the habit of putting snuff upon the foot

stove of the school-mistress may one day be discovered ,
and receive a ﬂogging

!Master Broom colored , and stared in great astonish

ment .!

“ But, thou art such an excellent scholar, I shall make

thee no further reproof.

“Thou ,
Hendrick,
didst
distinguish
thyself in
the

archery match last spring, and hit the d oel,

1 though the

bird was swung before it to unsteady thine eye .
I give

thee credit for excelling in manly sport and exercise ;
though I must not unduly countenance thy boat-racing,
since it leaves thee too little time for thy proper studies .

“ Lucretia and Hilda shall have a blessed sleep to

night .
The consciousness of kindness to the poor, devo

tion in their souls , and cheerful,
hearty obedience to

household rule, will render them happy .

“With one and all I avow myself well content .
Good

ness , industry, benevolence and thrift have prevailed in
your midst .
Therefore, my blessing upon you ; and may

the New Year ﬁnd all treading the paths of obedience, wis
dom and love !
To-morrow you shall ﬁnd more sub st an

tial proofs that I have been in your home .
Farewell !

”

With these wor ds came a great shower of sugar-plums

upon a linen sheet spread out in front of the doors .
A

general scramble followed
.
The children fairly tumbled

over each other in their eagerness to ﬁll their baskets .

M ev r ouw cautiously held the baby down upon the sheet

till the chubby little ﬁsts were ﬁlled .
Then the bravest

of the youngsters sprang up and threw open the closed
doors .
In vain they searched the mysterious
apart

ment .
St . Nicholas was nowhere to be seen .

Soon they all sped to another room , where stood a

table, covered with the whitest of linen damask .
Each

child , in a ﬂutter of pleasure, laid a shoe upon it, and
each shoe held a little hay for the good saint

’s horse .

The door was then carefully locked , and

‘ irs key hidden

in the mother

’s
bedroom .
Next
followed
good-night

kisses, a grand family procession to the upper ﬂoor,
merry farewells at bedroom doors, and silence, at last,
reigned in the Van Gleck mansion .

Early the next morning, the door w as solemnly
um

locked and opened in the presence of the assembled
household ;
when,
10 ! a sight appeared , proving good

St . Nicholas to be a saint of his word .

Every shoe w a s ﬁlled to overﬂowing ; and beside each

stood a many-colored pile .
The table w as heavy with

its load of presents,

—
candles, toys , trinkets, books and

other articles .
Every one had gifts, from grandfather

down to the baby .

Little Katy clapped her hands with glee, and vowed

inwardly that the
c at should never know another mo

ment

’s grief.

Hendrick capered about the room , ﬂourishing a superb

bow and arrows over his head .
Hilda laughed with de

light as she opened
a crimson box, and drew forth its

7 2
HANS BRINKER

glittering contents .
The rest chuckled , and said ,
Oh !

and

“Ah !

” over their treasures, Very much as we did

here in America on last Christmas Day .

With her glittering necklace in her hands, and a pile

of books in her arms, Hilda stole toward her parents ,
and held up her beaming face for a kiss .
There was

such an earnest, tender look in her bright eyes that her
mother breathed a blessing as she leaned over her .

“ I am delighted with this book : thank you , father !

sh e said , touching the top one with her Chin .

“ I shall

read it all day long .

“ Ay, sweetheart ,

” said mynheer,
you cannot do bet

ter .
There is no one like Father Cats .
If my daughter

learns his

‘ Moral Emblem

’ by heart , the mother and I

may keep silent .
The work you have there, the Em

blems, is his best work .
You will ﬁnd it enriched with

rare engravings from Van de Venne .

”

!Considering that the back of the book was turned

away, mynheer certainly showed a surprising familiarity
with an unopened volume presented by St . Nicholas .
It w as strange, too, that the saint should have found
certain things made by the elder children , and have
actually placed them upon the table, labelled with par
ents

’ and grandparents

’ names .
But all were too much

absorbed in happiness to notice slight inconsistencies .
Hilda saw on her father

’s face the rapt expression he always

wore when he spoke of Jacob Cats ; so she put her armful
of books upon the table, and resigned herself to listen .!

Old Father Cats, my child , was a great poet, not a

writer of plays, like the Englishman

lived in his time .
I have read them in the German ;

and very

‘ good they are,

—
very, very good ,

— but not

like Father
C ats

’

s .
Cats sees no daggers in the air;

he has no white women falling in love with dusky Moors ,
no young fools sighing to be a lady

’s glove, no crazy

princes mistaking respectable old gentlemen for rats .
No, no !
He writes only sense .
It is great wisdom in

little bundles ,

-a bundle for every day of your life .

You
can guide a state with C ats

’

s poems ; and you can

put a little baby to sleep with his pretty songs .
He

w as one of the greatest men of Holland .
When I take

you to the Hague, I will
Show you the
K loosterkerk

where he lies buried .
Ther e was a man for you to
Study,

my sons !
He was good through and through .
What

did he say

O Lord ! let me obtain this from thee,
To live with patience, and to die with pleasure .

Did patience mean folding his hands ?
No, he was

a lawyer, statesman , ambassador, farmer, philosopher,
historian and poet .
He
w as keeper of the Great Seal

of Holland .
He
w as
a
Bah !
there
is
too
much

noise here ; I cannot talk .
And mynheer, looking with

astonishment into the bowl of his meerschaum (for it
had

nodded to his
vr ouw, and left the

apartment in great haste .

1 O Heere ! laat my dat van uwen hand v erwerv en,

HANS BRINKER

The
fact
is,
his
discourse
had
been
accompanied

throughout with
a subdued
chorus of barking dogs,

squeaking cats and bleating lambs , to say nothing of a
noisy ivory cricket, that the baby w as whirling with in
ﬁnite delight .
At the last, little Huygens, taking
ad

vantage of the increasing loudness
Of mynheer

’s tones ,

had ventured a blast on his new trumpet ; and Wolfert

'

had hastily attempted an accompaniment on the drum .
This had brought matters to a crisis ;
and well for the

little creatures that it had .
The saint had left no ticket

for them to attend a lecture on Jacob Cats .
It was not

an appointed part of the ceremonies .
Therefore, when

the youngsters
saw that
the
mother looked
neither

frightened
nor offended , they gathered
new courage .

The grand chorus rose triumphant ;
and frolic and joy

reigned supreme .

Good St . Nicholas !
For th e sake of the young Hol

landers , I , for one, am willing to acknowledge him , and
defend his reality against all unbelievers .

Carl Schummel was quite busy during that day, assur

ing little children conﬁdentially that not St . Nicholas,
but their own fathers and mothers , had produced the
oracle, and loaded the tables .
But we know better than

that .

And yet , if this were a saint , why did he not visit the

Brinker cottage that night ?
Why was that one home,

so dark and sorrowful, passed by ?

Ah ! the little rogue has been kept at home .
— Now,

boys , it

’s just eight o

’clock, glorious weather ;
and the

Y is as ﬁrm as a rock .
We

’ll be at Amsterdam in thirty

minutes .
One, two , three

—
S TART !

True enough .
In less than half an

“hour, they had

crossed a dike of solid masonry, and were in the very
heart of the great metropolis of the
Netherlands,

—a

walled city of ninety-ﬁv e islands, and nearly two hun
dred bridges .
Although Ben had been there twice since

his arrival in Holland , he saw much to excite wonder ;
but his Dutch comrades, having lived near by all their
lives , considered it the most matter-of-course place in
the world .
Everything interested Ben,

— the tall houses,

with their forked Chimneys, and gabled ends facing the
street ;
the
merchants

’
warerooms,
perched
high
up

under the roofs of their dwellings, with long arm-like
cranes hoisting and lowering goods past the household

windows ;
the
grand
public
buildings,
erected
upon

wooden piles driven deep into the marshy ground ; the
narrow streets ; the canals everywhere crossing the city ;
the bridges ;
the locks ;
the various costumes ;
and ,

strangest of all, shops and dwellings crouching close to
the fronts of the churches, sending their long, disp ro

p ortionate chimneys far upward along the sacred walls .

If he looked up , he saw tall, leaning houses, seeming

to pierce the sky with their shining roofs ; if he looked
down , there was the queer street , without crossing or
curb , nothing to separate the cobble-stone pavement

78

BRINKER

schuiteu, however, only a foot or two long, and fitted out
complete, made his heart ache, he so longed to buy one
at once for his little brother in England .
He had no

money to spare ;
for, with true Dutch prudence, the

party had agreed to take with them merely the sum
t e

quired for each boy

’s expenses, and to consign the purse

to Peter for safe keeping .
Consequently , Master Ben

concluded to devote all his energies to sightseeing, and
to think as seldom as possible of little Robby .

He made a hasty call at the marine school, and envied

the sailor-students their full-rigged brig, and their sleep
ing berths swung over their trunks, or lockers .
He hur

ried through picture-galleries with the boys, and stared
for full ﬁve minutes at the famous picture of

“ The

Round of the Night ,

” or, as many called it,

“The Night

Watch ,

” by Rembrandt, wh o spent many years of his

life in Amsterdam .
He peeped into the Jews

’ quarter

of the city, where the rich diamond-cutters and squalid
old-clothesmen dwell, and wisely resolved to keep away
from it .
He also enjoyed hasty glimpses of the four

principal avenues of Amsterdam ,

—the Prinsen Gracht,

Keizers Gracht , Heeren Gracht and Singel .
These are

semicircular in form ;
and the ﬁrst three average more

than two miles in length .
A canal runs through the

centre of each , with a well-paved road on either side,
lined with stately buildings .
Rows of naked elms, bor

dering the canal, cast a network of shadows over its
frozen surface ;
and everything was so clean and bright

THE BOYS

79

that Ben told Lambert it seemed to him like petriﬁed
neatness .

Fortunately, the weather was cold enough to put a

stop to the usual street-ﬂooding and window-washing,
or our young excursionists might have been drenched
more
than
once .
Sweeping,
mopping
and
scrubbing

form a passion with Dutch housewives ;
and to soil

their spotless mansions is considered scarcely less than
a crime .
Everywhere
a hearty contempt is felt for

those who neglect to rub the soles of their shoes to a
polish before crossing the doorsill ; and , in certain places,
Visitors are expected to remove their heavy shoes before
entering, and leave them outside near the doorstep .

Sir William Temple, in his memoirs of

“ What passed

in Christendom from
1672 to

A stout Holland lass opened the door, and told him in
a breath that the lady was at home, and that his shoes
were not very clean .
Without another word , she took

tells a story of a

the astonished man up by both arms, threw him across
her back, carried him through two rooms, set him down
at the bottom of the stairs, seized a pair of slippers that
stood there, and put them upon his feet .
Then, and

not until then, she spoke, telling him that her mistress

was on the ﬂoor above, and that he might go up .

While Ben was skating with his friends upon the

crowded canals of the city, he found it difﬁcult to b e
lieve that the sleepy Dutchmen he saw around him ,

80
HANS
BRINKER

smoking their pipes so leisurely, and looking as though
their hats might be knocked
off their heads without

their making any resistance, were capable of those out
breaks that had taken place in Holland ; that they were
really fellow-countrymen of the brave, devoted heroes
of whom he had read in Dutch history .

As his party skimmed lightly
along, he told Van

M ounen of a burial-riot, which , in
1696, had occurred

in that very city, where the women and children turned
out as well as the men , and formed mock funeral-p r oces
sions through the town , to show the burgomasters that
certain new regulations, with regard to burying the dead ,
would not be acceded to ; how, at last, they grew so
un

manageable, and threatened so much damage to the
city, that the burgomasters were glad to recall the
of

fensive law .

“There

’s the corner,
said Jacob , pointing to some

large buildings,

“ where, about ﬁfteen years ago, the

great corn-houses sank down in the mud .
They were

strong affairs, and set up on good piles ;
but they had

over seventy thousand hundredweight of corn in them ,
and that was too much .

It was a long story for Jacob to tell, and he stopped

tO rest .

“ How do you know there were seventy thousand hun

d r edweight in them ?

” asked Carl, sharply .

“ You were

in your swaddling-clothes then .

Rousing himself with
an effort, he con

tinned ,
Ben likes pictures :
Show him some .

“All right,

” said the captain .

If we had time, Benjamin ,

” said Lambert
v an Mou

nen in English ,

“ I should like to take you to the City

Hall, or
Stadhuis .
There are building-piles for you !

It is built on nearly fourteen thousand of them , driven
seventy feet into the ground .
But what I wish you to

see there is the big picture of Van Sp eyk blowing up
his ship— great picture .

”

“Van who
asked Ben .

Van Sp eyk .
Don

’t you remember ?
He was in the

height of an engagement with the Belgians ;
and when

he found that they had the better of him and would
capture his ship , he blew it up, and himself too, rather
than yield to the enemy .

”

“ Wasn

’t that Van Tromp ?

Oh ,
no !
Van Tromp
was
another brave
fellow .

They

’ve a monument to him down at Delftsh av en,

— the

place where the Pilgrims took ship for America .

”

“ Well, what about Van Tromp ?
He was a great

Dutch admiral , wasn

’t he ?

”

“Yes ; he was in more than thirty sea-ﬁghts .
He beat

the Spanish ﬂeet and an English one, and then fastened
a broom to his masthead to show that he had swept
the English from the sea .
Takes the Dutch , to beat,

my boy !

”

Hold up !
cried Ben .
Broom or no broom, the

82
HANS BRINKER

English conquered him at last .
I remember all about

it now .
He was killed somewhere on the Dutch coast

in an engagement in which the British ﬂeet was
V Ictor I

ous .
TO O bad
he added maliciously,

“ wasn

’t it ?

”

“ Ahem ! where are we ?

” exclaimed Lambert, chang

ing the subject .

“ Halloo ! the others are way ahead of

u s
-all but Jacob .
Whew ! how fat he is !
He

’ll break

down before we

’re half-way .

Ben, of course, enjoyed skating beside Lambert, who,

though
a stanch Hollander, had been educated near

London, and could speak English as ﬂuently as Dutch ;
but he was not sorry when Captain
v an Holp called

out ,

“ Skates
off I There

’s the museum !

It was open ; and there was no charge on that d ay for

admission .
In they went, shufﬂing, as boys will when

they have a chance, just to hear the sound of their shoes
on the polished ﬂoor .

This museum is, in fact , a picture-gallery, where some

of the ﬁnest works of the Dutch masters are to be seen,
besides nearly
two hundred portfolios of rare
engr av

ings .

Ben noticed at once that some
Of the pictures were

hung on panels fastened to the wall with hinges .
These

could be swung forward , like a window-shutter, thus
enabling the subject to be seen in the best light .
The

plan served them well in viewing a small group by Ger
ard Douw, called

“The Evening School :
enabling them

THE BOYS IN AMSTERDAM
83

to observe its exquisite ﬁnish , and the wonderful way
in which the picture seemed to be lit through its own
windows .
Peter pointed out the beauties of another

pictu r e by Douw, called

“ The Hermit ;

” and he also

told them some interesting anecdotes of the artist, who

w as born at Leyden, in
16 13

.

“Three days painting a broom-handle !

” echoed Carl,

in astonishment, while the captain w as giving some in
stances
of Douw

’s extreme slowness of execution .

“ Yes, sir, three days ; and it is said that

' he spent ﬁve

in ﬁnishing one hand in a lady

’s portrait .
You see how

very bright and minute everything is in this picture .
His unﬁnished works were kept carefully covered ;
and

his painting-materials were put away in air-tight boxes,
as soon as he had ﬁnished using them for the day .
Ac

cording to all accounts, the studio itself must have been
as close as a bandbox .
The artist always entered it

on tiptoe, besides
sitting still,
befor e he commenced

work, until the slight dust caused by his entrance had
settled .
I have read somewhere that his paintings are im

proved by being Viewed through a magnifying-glass .
He

strained his eyes so badly with this extra ﬁnishing that
he w as forced to wear spectacles before he was thirty .
At forty he could scarcely see to paint ; and he couldn

’t

ﬁnd a pair of glasses anywhere that would help his sight .
At last, a poor old German woman asked him to try
hers .
They suited him exactly, and enabled him to go

on painting as well as ever .

”

84
HANS
BRINKER

Humph !

”
exclaimed Ludwig, indignantly .
That

was nice !
What did
she do without them , I wonder ?

”

“ Oh !

” said Peter, laughing,

“ likely she had another

pair.
At any rate,
Sh e insisted upon his taking them .

He
w as so grateful that he painted a picture of the

spectacles for her, case and all ; and she sold it to a burgo
master for a yearly allowance that made her comfortable
for the rest of her days .

”

“ Boys,

” called Lambert, in a loud whisper,
come

look at this bear-hunt !

It was a ﬁne painting by Paul Potter, a Dutch artist

of the seventeenth century, wh o produced excellent works
before he was Sixteen years old .
The boys admired it,

because the subject pleased them .
They passed care

lessly by the masterpieces of Rembrandt and Van der

Helst, and went into raptures over an ugly picture by
Van der Venne, representing a sea-ﬁgh t between the
Dutch and English .
They also stood spell-bound
b e

fore
a painting of two little urchins, one of whom was

taking soup, and the other eating an egg .
The prin

cip al merit in this work was that the young egg-eater
had kindly
Slobbered his face with the yolk for their

entertainment .

An
excellent
representation
of the
Feast
of St .

“ Look, Van Moumen I

The chorus of laugh

ter that followed this discovery brought an angry official
to the spot .

What now !
None of this racket !
Here, you beer

barrel, wake up I

” and Master Jacob received a very un

ceremonious shaking .

As soon as Peter saw th at Jacob

’s condition was not

serious, he hastened to the street to empty his
unfor tu

nate
c ap

.
While he was stuffn
in his handkerchief to

prevent the already frozen crown from touching hishead ,
the rest of the boys came down , dragging the bewildered
and indignant Jacob in their midst .

The order to start was again given .
Master Poot was

wide awake at last .
The ice was
a little rough and

broken just there ; but every boy w a s in high
Spirits .

“ Shall we go on by the canal, or the river ?

” asked

Peter .

“ Oh , the river, by all means I

” said Carl .
It will be

such fun .
They say it is perfect
Skating all the way ;

but it

’s much farther .

”

Jacob Poot instantly became interested .

” he cried .

Well, the canal it shall be,

” responded the captain,

if all are agreed
.

”

Agreed I

and Captain Peter led the way .

All right, come on .
We

A ND LITTLE ODDITIES

WHILE skating along at full speed , they heard the cars

from Amsterdam coming close behind them .

“ Halloo I

” cried Ludwig, glancing toward the rail

track,

“ who can

’t beat a locomotive ?
Let

’s give it a

r acef

’

The whistle screamed at the very idea :
so did the

boys , and at it they went .

For an instant the boys were ahead , hurrahing with

all their might- only for an instant, but even
that w as

something .

This
excitement
over, they began
to
travel
more

leisurely, and indulge in conversation and frolic .
Some

times they stopped to exchange a word with the guards,

wh o were stationed at certain distances along the canal .
These men, in winter, attend to keeping the surface free
from obstruction and garbage .
After a snow-storm , they

are expected to sweep the feathery covering away before

welcome to skaters .
Now and then the boys so far for

got their dignity as to clamber among the ice-bound
canal-boats , crowded together in a widened harbor
off

the canal ;
but the watchful guards would soon spy

them out, and order them down with a growl .

Nothing could
be
straighter than the
canal upon

which our party were skating, and nothing straighter
than the long rows of willow-trees that stood , bare and
wispy, along the bank .
On the opposite side, lifted high

above the surrounding country, lay the carriage-road
on top of the great dike built to keep the Haarlem Lake
within bounds .
Stretching out far in the distance,
u n

til it became lost in a point, was the glassy canal with
its many skaters, its brown-winged ice-boats, its push
chairs, and its queer little sleds, light as cork, ﬂying over
the ice by means of iron-pronged sticks in the hands of
the riders .
Ben was in ecstasy with the scene .

Ludwig van Holp had been thinking how strange it

w as that the English boy should know so much of Hol
land .
According to Lambert

’s account, he knew more

about it than the Dutch did .
This did not quite please

our young Hollander .
Suddenly he thought of something

that he believed would make the

“ Shon Pull

”

op en his

eyes .
He drew near Lambert with a triumphant,

“Tell him about the tulips I

”

Ben caught the word tulp en .

Oh , yes !

” said he, eagerly, in English .
The tulip

mania

—
are you speaking of that ?
I have often heard

90
HANS
BRINKER

What, the weight of a man ?

” cried Ben, showing

such astonishment in his eyes that Ludwig fairly
ca

pered .

“ No, no ! the weight of a bulb.
The first tulip w a s

sent here from Constantinople , about the year 1 560 .
It

w as so much admired that the rich people of Amsterdam
sent to Turkey for more .
From that time, they grew to

be the rage ; and it lasted for years .
Single roots brought

from one to four thousand ﬂo rins ;
and one bulb , the

Semper Augustus, brought ﬁfty-ﬁv e hundred .

”

“That

’s more than four hundred guineas of our money,

interposed Ben .

“ Yes, and I know I

’m right ; for I read it in a tr ansl a

tion from Beckman , only day before yesterday .
Well,

Sir , it w as great .
Every one speculated in tulips, even

the bargemen and rag-women and chimney-sweeps .
Th e

richest merchants were not ashamed to share the excite
ment .
People bought bulbs, and sold them again at a

tremendous proﬁt, without ever seeing them .
It grew

into a kind of gambling .
Some became rich by it in a

few days ;
and some lost everything they h ad .
L and ,

houses, cattle and even clothing, went for tulips, when
people had no ready money .
Ladies sold their jewels

and ﬁnery to enable them to join in the fun .
Nothing

else w as thought of.

People began to see what geese they were making

law :
and
the law turned its back upon them ;
debts

made in gambling were not binding, it said .
Then there

was a time
-thousands of rich speculators reduced to

beggary in an hour .
As old Beckman says,

‘ the bubble

3
”
w as burst at last .

“ Yes ;
and a big bubble it was,
said Ben, who had

listened with great interest .

“ By the way, did you

know that the name

‘ tulip

’ came from a Turkish word

signifying tu rba n

“ I had forgotten that,
answered Lambert ;
but it

’s

a capital idea .
Just fancy a party of Turks, in full head

gear, squatted upon
a lawn,

— perfect tulip-bed !
Ha ,

h a ! capital idea !

”

There,
groaned Ludwig to himself,
he

’s been tell

ing Lambert something wonderful about tulips : I knew

“The fact is,
continued Lambert,
you
c an conjure

Up quite a human picture out of a tulip-bed in bloom ,
especially when it is nodding and bobbing in the wind .
Did you ever notice it ?

”

“ Not I .
It strikes me, Van M ounen , that you Hol

landers
are
prodigiously
fond of the
ﬂower
to
this

day .

”

“ Certainly .

' You can

’t have a garden without them ,

—prettiest ﬂower that grows, I think .
My uncle h as

a magniﬁcent bed of the ﬁnest varieties at his summer
house on the other side of Amsterdam .

”

“ I thought your uncle lived in the city .

92
HANS BRINKER

So he does ; but his summer-house, or pavilion, is a

few miles
off .
He has another one built out over the

river .
We passed near it when we entered the city .

Everybody in Amsterdam has a pavilion somewhere, if
he can .

”

“ Do they ever live there ?

” asked Ben .

Bless you , no !
They are small affairs, suitable only

to spend a few hours in on summer afternoons .
There

are some beautiful ones on the southern end of the
Haarlem Lake :
now that they

’ve commenced to drain

it into polders, it will spoil that fun .
By the way, we

’ve

passed some red-roofed ones since we left home .
You

noticed them , I suppose, with their little bridges and
ponds and gardens, and their mottoes over the doorway .

Ben nodded .

“They make but little
Show now,
continued Lam

bert ;

“ but in warm weather they are delightful .
After

the willows sprout, uncle goes to his summer-house every
afternoon .
He dozes and smokes ; aunt knits, with her

feet perched upon a foot-stove, never mind how hot the
day ;
my cousin Rika and the other girls ﬁsh in the

lake from the windows, or chat with their friends row
ing by ; and the youngsters tumble about, or hang upon
the little bridges over the ditch .
Then they have coffee

and cakes, besides a great bunch of water-lilies on the
table : it

’s very ﬁne, I can tell you ; only (between our

selves) , though I was born here, I shall never fancy the
odor of stagnant water that hangs about most of the

94
HANS
BRINKER

And the house, too, and furniture, and way of living
everything is different .

”

“ Of course,
assented Lambert, complacently, as if to

say,
You could scarcely expect such general perfection

anywhere else than in Holland ;

”
“ but you will have all

the more to tell Jenny when you go back .

”

“ Yes , indeed !
I can say one thing,

—
if cleanliness is,

as they claim , next to godliness, Broek is safe .
It is the

cleanest place I ever saw in my life .
Why, my aunt

Poot, rich as she is, scrubs half the time ; and her house
looks as if it were varnished all over .
I wrote to mother

yesterday that
I
could
see my double
always
with

me, feet to feet, in the polished ﬂoor of the dining
room .

”

“ Your d ouble
That word puzzles me : what do you

mean ? ”

“ Oh !

number two .

“ Ah , I see !

” exclaimed Van M ounen .
Have you

ever been in your aunt Poot

’s grand parlor ?

Ben laughed .

“ Only once ;
and that w as on the day

of my arrival .
Jacob says I shall have no chance of

entering It again until the time of his sister K en au

’

— the week after Christmas .
Father has consented

that I shall remain to witness the great event .
Every

Saturday, Aunt Poot and her fat Kate go into that par
lor, and sweep and polish and scrub ; then it is darkened ,
and closed until Saturday comes again : not a soul enters

it in the mean time .
But the
schoonmaken as she calls

it, must be done, just the same .

”

“That is nothing .
Every parlor in Broek meets with

the same treatment,
said L ambert .

“ What do you

think of those moving ﬁgures in her neighbor

’s gar

den ?

”

“ Oh ! they

’re well
enough .
The swans must seem

really alive, gliding about the pond in summer; but that
nodding mandarin in the corner, under the chestnut
trees, is ridiculous, only ﬁt for Children to laugh at .
And

then the stiff garden-patches, and the trees, all trimmed
and painted !
Excuse me, Van M ounen ;
but I shall

never learn to admire Dutch taste .

”

“ It will take time,
answered Lambert, condescend

ingly;

“ but you are sure to agree with it at last .
I saw

much to admire in England , and I hope I shall be sent
back with you to study at Oxford ; but, take everything
together, I like Holland better .

”

“Of c ourse you do I

” said Ben, in a tone of hearty
ap

proval :

“you wouldn

’t be a good Hollander if you

didn

’t .
Nothing like loving one

’s country .
It is strange,

though , to have such a warm feeling for such a cold
place .
If we were not ex ercising all the time, we should

freeze outright .

”

Lambert laughed .

‘That

’s your English blood , Benjamin :
I

’m not cold .

And look at the skaters here on the canal ! they

’re red

as roses, and happy as lords .

— Halloo, good Captain van

HANS BRINKER

” called out Lambert in Dutch :
what

stopping at yonder farmhouse, and warming our toes

“ Who is cold ?

” asked Peter, turning around .

Benjamin Dobbs .
Benjamin Dobbs shall be warmed ;

98
HANS
BRINKER

May we
enter
and
warm
ourselves, j ufvr ouw

asked the captain , respectfully .

“ Yes, and welcome,

” was the reply, as the lower half

of the door swung open .
Every boy, before entering,

rubbed long and faithfully upon the rough mat within ;
and each made his best bow to the
Old lady and gentle

man
at the windows .
Ben was half inclined to think

that these personages were automata , like the moving
ﬁgures in the garden at Broek ; for they both nodded their
heads slowly , in precisely the same way, and both went
on with their employment as steadily and stifﬂy as though
they worked by machinery .
The old man puffed , puffed ;

and his
vr ouw clicked her knitting-needles , as if regulated

by internal cog-wheels .
Even the real smoke issuing from

the motionless pipe gave no convincing proof that they
were human .

But the rosy-checked maiden !
Ah , how she hustled

about !
How she gave the boys polished , high-backed

chairs to sit upon !
How she made the ﬁre blaze up as if

it were inspired !
How she made Jacob Poot almost

weep for joy by bringing forth a great square of ginger
bread , and a stone jug of sour wine !
How she laughed

and nodded as the boys
ar e like wild animals on good

behavior !
And h ow blank she looked when Ben politely

but ﬁrmly refused to take any black-bread and sour
krout !
How she pulled
off Jacob

’s mitten , which was

torn at the thumb , and mended it before his eyes , biting

off the thread with her white teeth , and saying,

“Now

ON THE WAY TO HAARLEM
99

it will be warmer,
as she bit Iand , ﬁnally, how she shook

hands with every boy in turn , and , throwing a depre
cating glance at the female automaton , insisted upon
ﬁlling their pockets with gingerbread I

All this time the knitting-needles clicked on , and the

pipe never missed a puff
.

When the boys were fairly on their way again , they

came in sight of Zwanenburg Castle, with its massive
stone front, and its gateway towers, each surmounted
with a sculptured swan .

“ 19a
n boys ,

” said Peter,
off with your skates !

You
see,
explained
Lambert
to
his
companion ,

the Y and the Haarlem Lake, meeting here, make it

rather troublesome .
The river is ﬁve feet higher than

the land ; so w e must have everything strong in the way
of dikes and sluice-gates , or there would be wet work
at once .
The sluice arrangements here are supposed to

be something extra .
We will walk over them , and you

shall see enough to make you open your eyes .
The

spring water of the lake, they say, has the most won

d erful bleaching powers of any in the world :
all the

great Haarlem bleacheries use it .
I can

’t say much

upon that subject ;
but I
can tell you
one thing from

personal experience .

“ What is that ?

”

Why, the lake is full of th e biggest eels you ever saw .

I

’ve caught them here, often

— perfectly prodigious !
I

1 Half-way.

I oo
HANS BRINKER

tell you they

’re sometimes a match for a fellow : they

’d

almost wriggle your arm from the socket , if you were
not on your guard .
But you

’re not interested in eels,

I perceive .
The castle

’s a big
affair, isn

’t it ?

”

“ Yes .
What do those swans mean ?
Anything ?

asked Ben , looking up at the stone gate-towers .

“ The swan is held almost in reverence by us Hol

landers .
These give the building its name,
Zwanen

burg- swan-castle .
That is all I know .
This is a very

important spot ;
for it is here that the Wise ones hold

council with regard to dike matters .
The castle was once

the residence of the celebrated Christiaan B r ii nings .

”

“ What about him ?

” asked Ben .

Peter could answer you better than I ,
said Lam

bert ,

“ if you could only understand
each
other ;
or

were
not
such
cowards
about
leaving your
mother

tongues .
But I have often heard my grandfather speak

of B rii nings .
He is never tired of telling us of the great

engineer : how good he was, and how learned ; and how,
when he died , the whole country seemed to mourn as
for a friend .
He belonged to a great many learned
so

cieties, and was at the head of the State Department,
intrusted with the care of the dikes , and other defences
against the sea .
There

’s no counting the improvements

he made in dikes and sluices and water-mills , and all
that kind of thing .
We Hollanders , you know, consider

our great engineers as the highest of public benefactors .

B riinings died years ago :

A CATASTROPHE

IT
w as nearly one o

’clock when Captain
v an Holp

and his command entered the grand old city of Haar
lem .
They had skated nearly seventeen miles since

morning, and were still as fresh as young eagles .
From

the youngest (Ludwig
v an Holp ,
who
w as just four

teen) to the eldest (no less a personage than the captain
himself, a veteran of seventeen) , there was but one
opinion ,

— that this was the greatest frolic of their lives .

To be sure, Jacob Poot had become rather short of
breath during the last mile or two, and perhaps he felt
ready for another nap ; but there was enough jollity in
him yet for a dozen .
Even Carl Schummel , who had

become very intimate with Ludwig during the excur
sion , forgot to be ill-natured .
AS for Peter, he was the

happiest of the happy ; his joyous song and merry whistle,
as he skated along, had cheered many a passer-by that day .

Come, boys , it

’s nearly tiﬂin1-hour,

” he said ,

'as they

A CATASTROPHE
103

neared a coffee-house on the main street .
We must

have something more solid than the pretty maiden

’s

gingerbread ;

” and the captain plunged his hands into

his p ock

f
ets, as if to say,

“ There

’s money enough here to

feed an army !

”

“ Halloo !

” cried Lambert .
What ails the man ?

Peter, pale and staring, was clapping his hands upon

his breast and sides :
he looked like one suddenly b e

coming deranged .

“ He

’s sick !

” cried Ben .

No, he

’s lost something,
said Carl .

Peter could only gasp ,
The pocket-book, with all

our money in it

—
it

’s gone !

For
an
instant,
all
were
too
much
startled
to

speak .

Carl at last came out with a gruff

“ No sense in letting one fellow have all the money

I said so from the ﬁrst .
Look in your other pocket .

“ I did : it isn

’t there .

”

Open your under jacket .

Peter obeyed mechanically .
He even took
off his hat ,

and looked into it, then thrust his hand desperately
into every pocket .

“ It

’s gone, boys ,
he said at last in a hopeless tone .

No tzﬁ n for us , nor dinner either .
What is to be done ?

We can

’t get
on without money .
If we were in Amster

dam , I could get as much as we want ; but there is not
a man
In Haarlem from whom I can borrow a stiver .

104
HANS
BRINKER

Don

’t one of you know any one here who would lend
us

a few guilders

Each boy looked into ﬁve blank faces .
Then some

thing like
a smile passed around the circle ;
but it got

sadly knotted up when it reached Carl .

“That wouldn

’t do,

” he said crossly .
I know some

people here, rich ones too ;
but father would ﬂog me

soundly if I borrowed a cent from any one .
He has

‘AN

HONEST MAN NEED
NOT B ORRow,

’ written over the gate

w ay
of his summer-house .

”

“ Humph I

”
responded
Peter,
not
particularly
ad

miring the sentiment just at that moment .

The boys grew desperately hungry at once .

“ It wash my fault,

” said Jacob in a penitent tone to

Ben .

“ I say ﬁrst ,

‘ Petter all de boys put zair pursh into

Van Holp

’

s monish .

’

“ Nonsense, Jacob ! you did it all for the best .
Ben said this in such a sprightly tone that the two

Van Holp s and Carl felt sure he had proposed a plan
that would relieve the party at once .

“ What , what ?
Tell us, Van M ou nen,
they cried .

He says it is not Jacob

’s fault that the money is lost ;

that he did it for the best , when he proposed that Van
Holp should put all of our money into his purse .

”

“ Is that all ?

” said Ludwig, dismally .

“ He need not

have made such a fuss in just saying that.
How much

money have we lost ?

”

“ Don

’t you remember ?

” said Peter .
We each put

106
HANS BRINKER

back pleasantly, and like men,
said Peter, looking so

gallant and handsome, as he turned his frank face and
clear blue eyes upon them , that they caught his
Sp l l

‘ l t .

“ HO , for the captain I

” they shouted .

Now, boys , we may as well make up our minds there

’s

no place like Broek, after all ; and that we mean to be
there in two hours .
Is that agreed to ?

“Agreed I

” cried all, as they ran to the canal .

On with your skates !
Are you ready ?
Here, Jacob ,

let me help you .

”

“ Now .
One, two, three, start !

And the boyish faces that left Haarlem at that signal

were nearly as bright as those that had entered it with
Captain Peter half an hour before .

DONDER and Blix in I

” cried Carl, angrily, before the

party had skated twenty yards from the city gates,

“ if

here isn

’t that wooden-skate
r agamuﬂi n in the patched

leather breeches !
That fellow is everywhere, confound

him !
We

’ll be lucky,

” he added , in as sneering a tone

as he dared to assume,
if our captain doesn

’t order us

to halt and shake hands with him .

“ Your
captain
is
a
terrible
fellow,
said
Peter,

pleasantly .

“ But this is a false alarm , Carl :
I
c an

not spy your bugbear
anywhere
among the
skaters .

Ah , there he is !
Why, what is the matter with the

lad ?

”

Poor Hans !
His face was pale, his lips compressed .

He skated like one. under the effects of a fearful dream .
Just as he was passing, Peter hailed him .

“ Good-d ay, Hans Brinker !
Hans

’s countenance brightened at once .
Ah , myn

heer !
Is that you ?
It is well w e meet I

”

“ Just like his impertinence !

” hissed Carl Schummel,

1 07

I o8
HANS
BRINKER

darting scornfully past his companions, who seemed in

clined to linger with their captain .

“ I am glad to see you, Hans ,
responded Peter, cheerily ;

but you look troubled .
Can I serve you ?

”

“ I have a trouble, mynheer,
answered Hans , casting

down his eyes .
Then , lifting them again with almost a

happy expression, he added ,

“ But it is Hans who can

help Mynheer
v an Holp this time .

”

“ How ?

” asked Peter, making, in his blunt Dutch

w ay, no attempt to conceal his surprise .

“ By giving you this , mynheer;

”
and Hans held forth

the missing purse .

“ Hurrah I

” shouted the boys, taking their cold hands

from their pockets to wave them joyfully in the air .
But

Peter said ,

“ I thank you , Hans Brinker I

” in a tone that

made Hans feel as if the king had bowed to him .

The shout of the delighted boys reached the mufﬂed

ears of the ﬁne young gentleman, who, under a full pres
sure of pent-up wrath , w as skating toward Amsterdam .
A Yankee boy would have wheeled about at once, and
hastened to satisfy his curiosity .
But Carl only halted ,

and , with his back toward his party, wondered what on
earth had happened .
There he stood , immovable, until,

feeling sure that nothing but the prospect of something
to eat could have made them hurrah so heartily, he
turned , and skated slowly toward his excited comrades .

Meantime
Peter had
drawn
Hans
aside
from
the

Test .

1 I O
HANS BRINKER

Yes , mynheer ;
and I have not a moment to lose .

Good -day I

”

“ Stay : I am going that way .
—Come, my lads !
Shall

we return to Haarlem

“ Yes I

” cried the boys , eagerly ; and
off they started .

Now,
said Peter, drawing near Hans , both skim

ming the ice so easily and lightly as they skated on to
gether, that they seemed scarce conscious of moving,

“ we are going to stop at Leyden ; and , if you are going
there only with a message to Dr . Bockman , cannot I do
the errand for you ?
The boys may be too tired to skate

so far to-day ;
but I will promise to see him early to

morrow, if he is to be found in the city .

”

“ Ah , mynheer ! that would be serving me indeed .
It

is not the distance I dread , but leaving my mother so
long .

”

“ Is she ill ?

No, mynheer .
It is the father .
You may have heard

it ,

— how he has been without wit for many a year, ever

since the great Schlossen Mill was built ; but his body has
been well and strong .
Last night the mother knelt upon

the hearth to blow the peat (it is his only delight to sit
and watch the live embers ; and she will blow them into
a blaze every hour of the day, to please him)

.
Before

she could stir, he sprang upon her like a giant, and held
her close to the ﬁre, all the time laughing, and shaking
his head .
I was on the canal ; but I heard the mother

scream , and ran to her .
The father had never loosened

HANS
I 1 1

his hold ; and her gown was smoking .
I tried to deaden

the ﬁre ;
but with one hand he pushed me
off .
There

was no water in the cottage, or I could have done better;
and all that time he laughed , such a terrible laugh , myn
heer !
Hardly a sound , but all in his face .
I tried to pull

her away ; but that only made it worse .
Then
-it was

dreadful ; but could I see the mother burn

— I beat him ,

beat him with a stool .
He tossed me away .
The gown

w as on ﬁre .
I would put it out .
I can

’t remember well

after that : I found myself upon the ﬂoor, and the mother
was praying .
It seemed to me that she was in a blaze ;

and , all the while, I could hear that laugh .
My sister

Gretel screamed out that he was holding the mother
close to the very coals :
I could not tell !
Gretel ﬂew to

the closet, and ﬁlled a porringer With the food he liked ,
and put it upon the ﬂoor .
Then , mynheer, he left the

mother, and crawled to it like a little child .
She was

not burnt , only a part of her clothing .
Ah , how kind she

w as to him all night ! watching and tending him .
He

slept in a high fever, with his hand pressed to his head .
The mother says he has done that so much of late, as
though he felt pain there .
Ah , mynheer, I did not mean

to tell you .
If the father was himself, he would not harm

even a kitten .

For a moment the two boys moved on in silence .

It is terrible,

” said Peter at last .
How is he to-day ?

Very sick, mynheer .

”

Why go for Dr . Bockman, Hans !
There are others

1 1 2
HANS
BRINKER

in Amsterdam who could help him , perhaps .
Bockman

is a famous man , sought only by the wealthiest ;
and

they often wait upon him in vain .

“ He pr omised, mynheer :
he promised me yesterday

to come to the father in a week .
But, now that the

change has come, we cannot wait

—
w e think the poor

father is dying .
Oh , mynheer ! you can plead with him

to come quick .
He will not wait a whole week, and our

father dying, the good meester is so kind .

”

“ So hind !

” echoed Peter, in astonishment .
Why,

he is known as the crossest man in Holland I

”

“ He looks so because he has no fat, and his head is

busy ;
but his heart is kind , I know .
Tell the meester

what I have told you , mynheer, and he will come .

”

“ I hope so, Hans, with all my heart .
You are in haste

to turn homeward , I see .
Promise me, that , should you

need a friend , you will go to my mother, at Broek .
Tell

her I bade you see her .
And , Hans Brinker, not as a

reward , but as a gift, take a few of these guilders .

”

Hans shook his head resolutely .

“ No, no, mynheer !
I cannot take it .
If I could ﬁnd

work in Broek, or at the South Mill, I would be glad .

3 ”
But it is the same story everywhere

—
‘ Wait till spring .

“ It is well you speak of it ,

” said Peter, eagerly ;
for

my father needs help at once .
Your pretty chain pleased

him much .
He said ,

‘ That boy has a clean cut : he would

be good at carving .
There is to be a carved portal to our

new summer-house ; and father will pay well for the job .

”

IT must not be supposed that our young Dutchmen

had already forgotten the great skating-race which was
to take place on the
20th .
On the contrary, they had

thought and spoken of it very
Often during the day .

Even Ben, though he had felt more like a traveller than
the rest , had never once, through all the sight-seeing,
lost a certain Vision of silver skates , which for a week
past had haunted him night and day .

Like a true

“ John Bull ,

” as Jacob had called him, he

never doubted that his English ﬂeetness, English strength ,
English everything, could at any time enable him , on
the ice, to put all Holland to shame, and the rest of the
world too, for that matter .
Ben certainly was a superb

skater .
He had enjoyed not half the opportunities for

practising that had fallen to his new comrades ; but he
had improved his share to the utmost ; and was , besides ,
so strong of frame, so supple of limb , in short , such a
tight , trim , quick, graceful fellow in every w ay, that he

1 14

HOMES
I 1 5

had taken to skating as naturally as a Chamois to leap
ing, or an eagle to soaring .

Only to the heavy heart of poor Hans had the vision

of the

“
silver

' skates failed to appear during that starry

winter night and the brighter sunlit day .

Even Gretel had seen them ﬂitting before her as she

sat beside her mother through those hours of weary
watching,

-not

i as prizes to be won, but as treasures

passing hopelessly beyond her reach .

Rychie, Hilda and Katrinka

—
why, they had scarcely

known any other thought than

“ the race, the race !
It

will come
off on the
20th I

”

These three girls were friends .
Though of nearly the

same age, talent and station , they were as different as
girls could be .

Hilda
v an Gleck you already know,

—
a warm-hearted ,

noble girl of fourteen .
Rychie Korbes was beautiful to

look upon, far more sparkling and pretty than Hilda ,
but not half so bright and sunny within .
Clouds of pride,

of discontent and envy, had already gathered in her
heart , and were growing bigger and darker every day .
Of course, these often relieved themselves , very much
after the manner

! of other clouds .
But who saw the

storms and the weeping ?
Only her maid , or her father,

mother
a nd little brother,

—
those who loved her better

than all .
Like other clouds , too, hers often took queer

shapes ; and what was really but mist and vapory fancy
assumed the appearance of monster wrongs and moun

HANS BRINKER

tains of difficulty .
To her mind , the poor peasant-girl

Gretel was not a human being, a God-created creature
like herself : she was only something that meant

“

p ov

er ty, rags and dirt .

”
Such as Gretel had no right to

feel , to hope :
above all, they should never cross the

paths of their betters ; that is, not in a disagreeable way .
They could toil and labor for them at a respectful dis
tance, even admire them, if they would do it humbly,
but nothing more .
If they rebel, put them down :
if

they suffer, don

’t trouble me about it,
w as
Rychie

’

s

secret motto .
And yet how witty she was ! how taste

fully she dressed ! how charmingly she sang ! how much
feeling she displayed (for pet kittens and rabbits !) and
how
completely
she
could
bewitch
sensible,
honest

minded lads like Lambert van Moumen and Ludwig

v an Holp !

Carl was too much like her, within , to be an earnest

admirer ;
and perhaps he suspected the clouds .
He,

being deep
and
surly, and
always uncomfortably in

earnest, of course preferred the lively Katrinka, whose
nature was made of a hundred tinkling bells .
She was

a coquette in her infancy, a coquette in her childhood ,
and now a coquette in her school-days .
Without a

thought of harm , she coquetted with her studies , her
duties, even her little troubles .
They shouldn

’t know

when they bothered her, not they .
She coquetted with

her mother, her pet lamb , her baby brother, even with
her own golden curls, tossing them back as if she des

BRINKER

and-white hyacinths .
She loved
their freshness
and

fragrance, and the light-hearted way in which their bell
shaped blossoms swung in the breeze .

Carl
w a s both right and wrong when he said that

Katrinka and
Rychie were furious at the very idea of

the peasant Gretel joining in the race .
He had heard

Rychie declare it w a s

“ disgraceful, shameful, too bad !

which in Dutch , as in English , is generally the strongest
expression an indignant girl
can use .
And he had seen

Katrinka nod her pretty head , and heard her sweetly
echo,

“ Shameful , too bad !

” as nearly like
Rychie as

tinkling bells can be like the voice of real anger .
That

had satisﬁed him .
He never suspected , that had Hilda ,

not Rychie, ﬁrst talked with Katrinka upon the subject ,
the bells would have jingled as willing an echo .
She

would have said ,

“ Certainly, let her join us ,

” and would

have skipped
off , thinking no more about it .
But
now

Katrinka , with sweet emphasis , pronounced it a
shame

that a goose-girl, a forlorn little creature like Gretel,
should be allowed to spoil the race .

Rychie, being rich and powerful
in a school-girl way) ,

had other followers besides Katrinka, who were induced
to share her opinions, because they were either too care
less or too cowardly to

think for th emselv s .

Poor little Gretel !

' Her home was sad and dark enough

now .
Raff Brinker lay moaning upon his rough bed ;

and
his
vr ouw,
forgetting
and
forgiving
everything,

bathed his forehead , his lips, weeping, and praying that

HOMES
I 19

he might not die .
Hans, as w e know, had started in

desperation for Leyden , to search for Dr .
B oekm an,

and induce him , if possible, to come to their father at
once .
Gretel; ﬁlled with a strange dread , had done the

work as well as she could , wiped the rough brick ﬂoor,
brought peat to build
. up the slow ﬁre, and melted ice

for her mother

’s use .
This accomplished , she seated her

self upon a low stool near the bed , and begged her mother
to try and sleep a while .

“ You are so tired I

” she whispered .
Not once have

you closed your eyes since that dreadful hour last night .
See, I have straightened the willow-bed in the corner,
and spread everything soft upon it I could ﬁnd , so that
the mother might lie in comfort .
Here is your jacket .

Take
off that pretty dress .
I

’ll fold it away very care

fully, and put it in the big chest before you go to sleep .

”

Dame Brinker shook her head , without turning her

eyes from her husband

’s face .

“ I
can watch , mother,

” urged Gretel ;
and I

’ll wake

you every time the father stirs .
You are so pale, and

your eyes are so red !
O mother, d o!

”

The child pleaded in vain .
Dame Brinker would not

leave her post .

Gretel looked at her in troubled silence, wondering

whether it were very wicked to care more for one parent
than for the other, and sure, yes , quite sure, that she
dreaded her father, while she clung to her mother with
a love that was almost idolatry .

1 20
HANS BRINKER

Hans loves the father so well ,
she thought,
why

cannot I ?
Yet I could not help crying when I saw his

hand bleed that day, last month , when he snatched the
knife ; and now, when he moans , how I ache ,

—ache all

over !
Perhaps I love him , after all , and God will see I

am not such a bad , wicked
girl as I thought .
Yes, I

love the poor father, almost as Hans does

— not quite ;

for Hans is stronger, and does not fear him .
Oh ! will

that moaning go on forever and ever ?
Poor mother,

how patient she is !
She never pouts , as I do, about the

money that went away so strangely .
If he only could ,

just for one instant , open his eyes and look at us, as Hans
does , and tell us where mother

’s guilders went, I would

not care for the rest .
Yes, I would care ; I don

’t want

the poor father to die, to be all blue and cold , like Annie

B oum an

’

s little sister

—
I know I don

’t .
Dear God , I

don

’t want father to die .

Her thoughts merged into a prayer .
When it ended

th e poor child scarcely knew .
Soon she found herself

watching a little pulse of light at the side of the ﬁre,

b eating faintly, but steadily, showing that somewhere

i n the dark pile there was warmth and light that would
overspread it at last .
A large earthen
cup , ﬁlled with

b urning peat, stood near the bedside : Gretel had placed
it there to

“ stop the father

’s shivering,

” she said .
She

watched it as it sent a glow around the mother

’s form,

tipping her faded skirt with light , and shedding a sort of
newness over the threadbare bodice .
Ité was a relief to

1 22
HANS
BRINKER

work .
Rychie would have shuddered to touch either;

yet they pressed warmly upon each other .
Soon Gretel

looked up with that dull, homely look, which they say
poor children in shanties are apt to have, and said in a
trembling voice,

“ The father tried to burn you, he did : I saw him

and he was laughing !

”

Hush , child I

”

The mother

’s words came so suddenly and sharply

that Raff Brinker, dead as he was to all that was pas
sing round him , twitched slightly upon the bed .

Gretel said no more, but plucked drearily at the jagged

edge of a hole in her mother

’s holiday gown .
It had

been burned there .
Well for Dame Brinker that the

gown w as woollen .

HAARLEM— THE BOYS HEAR VOICES

REFRESHED and rested , our boys came forth from the

coffee-house just as the big clock in the square, after
the manner of certain Holland time-keepers , w as strik
ing two with its half-hour h ell for half-past two .

The captain
w a s absorbed in thought , at ﬁrst ;
for

Hans B rinker

’

s sad story still echoed in his ears .
Not

until Ludwig rebuked him with a laughing,

“ Wake up ,

grandfather !

” did he re-assume his position as gallant

boy-leader of his band .

“Ahem !
This way, young gentlemen !

They were walking through the streets of the city,

not on a curbed
sidewalk (for such a thing is rarely to be

found in Holland) , but on the brick pavement that lay
on the borders of the cobble-stone carriage-way without
breaking its level expanse .

Haarlem , like Amsterdam, was gayer than usual , in

honor of St . Nicholas .

A strange ﬁgure
was
approaching them .
It was a

1 23

1 24
HANS BRINKER

small man , dressed in black, with a short cloak .
He

wore a wig and a cocked hat , from which a long, crape
streamer was ﬂying .

“ Who comes here ?

” cried Ben .
What a queer-look

ing object I

”

That

’s the
a anspr eeker ,
said Lambert .
Some one

is dead .

”

Is that the
way men dress in mourning in this

country ?

”

“ Oh , no !
The
a nnspr eeker attends funerals ;
and it

is his business , when any one dies , to notify all the friends
and relatives .

”

What a strange custom !
Well,
said Lambert ,

“we needn

’t feel very badly

about this particular death ;
for I see another man has

lately been born to the world to ﬁll up the vacant place .

”

Ben stared .

“ How do you know that ?

”

Don

’t you see that pretty red pin-cushion hanging

on yonder door ?

” asked Lambert , in return .

“ Yes .

”

Well , that

’s a boy .

A boy !
What do you mean ?

I mean , that here in Haarlem , whenever a boy is

born , the parents have a red pin-cushion put out at the
door .
If our young friend had been a girl, instead of a

boy, the cushion would have been white .
In some places

they have much more fanciful affairs , all trimmed with
lace ; and , even among the very poorest houses, you will

HAARLEM

— THE BOYS HEAR VOICES
1 25

see a bit of ribbon, or even a string, tied on the door
latch .

“ Look !
almost screamed Ben .
There is a white

cushion
at the door of that double-jointed house with

the funny roof I

“ I don

’t see any house with a funny roof.

Oh , of course not !

” said Ben .
I forget you

’re

a native .
But all the roofs are queer to me, for that

matter .
I mean the house next to that green building .

”

“True enough , there

’s a girl !
I tell you what ,
cap

tain,

” called out Lambert, slipping easily into Dutch ,

“ we must get out of this street as soon as possible .
It

’s

full of babies .
They

’ll set up a squall in a moment .

The captain laughed .

“ I shall take you to hear better

music than that,

” he said .

“ We are just in time to hear

the organ of St . Bavon .
The church is open to-day .

”

“ What , the great Haarlem organ
asked Ben .

“ That

will be a treat indeed .
I have often read of it , with its

tremendous pipes, and its
Vox
Huma na ,

1 that sounds

like a giant singing .

”

“The same,

” answered Lambert van Mounen .

Peter was right .
The church was open, though not

for religious services .
Some one was playing upon the

organ .
As the boys entered , a swell of sound rushed

forth to meet them .
It seemed to h ear them, one by

one, into the shadows of the building .

Louder and louder it grew, until it became like the

1 An organ-stop which produces an effect resembling the human voice.

I 26
HANS BRINKER

din and roar of some mighty tempest, or like the ocean
surging upon the shore .
In the midst of the tumult, a

tinkling
hell was heard ;
another answered , then
an

other, and the storm paused as if to listen .
The bells

grew bolder : they rang out loud and clear .
Other deep

toned bells joined in : they were tolling in solemn con
cert ,

-ding-dong, ding-dong !
The storm broke forth

again with redoubled fury, gathering its distant thunder .
The boys looked at each other, but did not speak .
It

was growing serious .
What w as that
Who screamed

What screamed ,

— that terrible, musical scream ?
Was

it man , or demon ?
Or was it some monster, shut up

behind that carved
brass frame, behind
those great

silver
columns ,

—
some
despairing
monster,
begging,

screaming, for freedom ?
It w as the Vox Humana !

At last an answer came,

-soft , tender, loving, like a

mother

’s song .
The storm grew silent .
Hidden birds

sprang forth , ﬁlling the air with glad , ecstatic music,
rising higher and higher, until the last faint note was
lost in the distance .

The
Vox
Humana
w as stilled ;
but , in the glorious

hymn of thanksgiving that now arose, one could almost
hear the throbbing of a human heart .
What did it

mean ?
That man

’s imploring cry should in time be met

with a deep content ?
That gratitude would give us

freedom ?
To Peter and Ben, it seemed that the angels

were singing .
Their eyes grew dim , and their souls

dizzy, with a strange joy .
At last, as if borne upward

1 28
HANS BRINKER

Do you know how large it is ?

”
asked Ben .
I

noticed that the church itself was prodigiously high , and
that the organ ﬁlled the end of the great aisle almost
from ﬂoor to roof.

”

“ That

’s true,

” said Lambert ;
and how
supg rb the

pipes looked ,

— just like grand columns of silver .
They

’re

only for show,
you know :
the
r eal pipes are behind

them ,

—some big enough for a man to crawl through ,

and some smaller than a baby

’s whistle .
Well, sir, for

size, the church is higher than Westminster Abbey, to
begin with ; and , as you say, the organ makes a tr emen
dous show, even then .
Father told me, last night, that

it is one hundred and eight feet high , ﬁfty feet broad ,
and has over ﬁve thousand pipes : it has sixty-four stops,
if you know what they are (I don

’t) , and three key

boards .

“ Good for you I said Ben .
You have a ﬁne memory .

My head is a perfect colander for ﬁgures :
they slip

through as fast as they

’re poured in .
But other facts,

and historical events, stay behind :
that

’s some con

solation .

”

“ There we
differ,
returned
Van
M ounen .

“ I

’m

great on names and ﬁgures ;
but history, take it alto

gether, seems to me to be the most hopeless kind of a
jumble .

”

Meantime Carl and Ludwig were having a discussion

concerning some square, wooden monuments they had
observed in the interior of the church .
Ludwig declared

HAARLEM— THE BOYS HEAR VOICES
1 29

that each bore the name of the person buried beneath ;
and Carl insisted that they had no names , but only the
heraldic arms of the deceased , painted on a black ground ,
with th e d ate of the death in gilt letters .

“ I ought to know,

” said Carl ;

“ for I walked across

to the east side to look for the cannon-ball which mother
told me was embedded there .
It was ﬁred into
th e

church , in the year ﬁfteen hundred and something, by
those rascally Spaniards, while the services were going
on .
There it was in the wall, sure enough ;
and , while

I was walking back, I noticed the monuments .
I tell

you they haven

’t a sign of a name upon them .

”

“Ask Peter,

” said Ludwig, only half convinced .

Car! is right ,

” replied Peter, wh o , though conversing

with Jacob , had overheard their dispute .
Well, Jacob ,

as I was saying, Handel , the great composer, chanced
to visit Haarlem , and , of course, he at once hunted up
this famous organ .
He gained
admittance, and was

playing upon it with all his might , when the regular
organist chanced to enter the building .
The man stood

awestruck .
He was a good player himself; but he had

never heard such music before .

‘ Who is there ?

’ he

cried .

‘ If it is not an angel or the devil, it must be Han

d el I

’
When he discovered that it was the great musi

cian, he was still more mystiﬁed .

‘ But how is this ?

’

said he :

‘you have done impossible things .
No ten

ﬁngers on earth can play the passages you have given :
human hands couldn

’t control all the keys and stops .

’

x39
HANS
BRINKER

‘ I know it ,

’ said Handel, coolly,

‘ and , for that reason ,

I was forced to strike some notes with the end of my
nose .
Dond er I just think how the old organist

have stared I

”

“ He

What ?

exclaimed

Y

Peter

’s animated voice suddenly became silent .

“ Haven

’t you heard me, you rascal ?

” was the.

nant rejoinder .

“ Oh , yes I

—

— the fact is

—
I heard you
at

I

’m awake now ;
but I do believe I

’ve been walking

beside you half asleep ,
stammered Jacob , with such a

doleful , bewildered look on his face that Peter could
not help laughing .

134
HANS
BRINKER

cussed this subject .
They also had a rather warm argu

ment concerning another invention .
Lambert declared

that the honor of giving both the telescope and micro
scope to the world lay between Metius and Jansen , both
Hollanders ;
while Ben as stoutly insisted that Roger

Bacon ,
an
English
monk of the thirteenth
century,

“ wrote out the whole thing , sir,

—perfect descriptions

of microscopes and telescopes too,

—long before either

of those other fellows were born .

”

On one subject, however, they both agreed ,

— that the

art of curing and pickling herrings
w a s discovered by

William B eukles of Holland , and that the country did
perfectly right in honoring him as a national benefactor ;
for its wealth and importance had been, in a great meas
ure, due to its herring-trade .

“ It is astonishing,
said Ben,
in what prodigious

quantities those ﬁsh are found .
I don

’t know how it is

here ;
but on the coast of England ,
off Yarmouth , the

herring-shoals have been known to be six and seven feet
deep with ﬁsh .

“That
is prodigious, indeed ,
said Lambert ;
but

you know your word

‘ herring

’ is derived from the Ger

man heer (

‘ an army

’) on account of a way the ﬁsh have

of coming in large numbers .

”

Soon afterward , while passing a cobbler

’s shop , Ben

exclaimed ,

“ Halloo, Lambert ! here is the name of one of your

greatest men over a cobbler

’s stall I

— Boerhaave .
If it

THE MAN WITH FOUR HEADS
133

were only Herman Boerhaave, instead of Hendrick, it
would be complete

Lambert knit his brows
r eﬂectiv ely, as he replied ,

Boerhaave,
Boerhaave !
The
name
is
perfectly

familiar .
I remember, too , he was born in
1668 ;
but

the rest is all gone,
as usual .
There have been so many

famous Hollanders, you
see, it is impossible for a fellow

to know them all .
What was he ? Did he have two heads

Or
w as b e one of your great natural swimmers, like

Marco Polo ?

”

“ He had four heads,
answered Ben , laughing ;
for

he was a great physician , naturalist, botanist and chemist .
I am full of him just now; for I read his life a few weeks
ago

Pour out a little, then,
said Lambert .
Only walk

faster : we shall lose sight of the other boys .

“ Well,

” resumed Ben , quickening his pace, and look

ing with great interest at everything going on in the
crowded
street .

“This
Dr .
Boerhaave
w as
a
great

anspewker
.

”

“ A great what?

” roared Lambert .

Oh , I beg pardon !
I was thinking of that man over

there, with the cocked hat .
He

’s an a nspewker , isn

’t he ?

”

“ Yes .
He

’s an
a a nspr eeker , if that is what you mean

to say .
But what about your friend with the four heads

“ Well , as I w as going to say, the doctor was left a

penniless orphan at sixteen , without education or friends .

”

Jolly beginning I

” interposed Lambert .

134
HANS
BRINKER

Now don

’t interrupt .
He was
a poor friendless

orphan at sixteen ; but he was so persevering and indus-
s

t rious, so determined to gain knowledge, that he made
his way, and in time became one of the most learned
men of Europe .
All th e
What is that ?

”

“ Where ?
What do you mean ?

”

Why, that paper on the door opposite .
Don

’t you

see ? Two or three persons are reading it .
I have noticed

several of these papers since I

’ve been here .

“ Oh ! that

’s only a health-bulletin .
Somebody in the

house is ill ;
and , to prevent a steady knocking at the

door, the family write an account of the patient

’s
con

dition on a placard , and hang it outside the door for the
beneﬁt of inquiring friends ,

—
a very sensible
custom ,

I

’m sure .
Nothing strange about it that I
can see .
GO

on , please .
You said ,

‘ All the,

hanging .

”

“ I was going to say,
resumed Ben,
that all the

How comically persons do dress here, to be sure !

Just look at those men and women with their sugar
loaf hats, and see this woman ahead of us with a straw
bonnet like a scoop-shovel, tapering to a point in the
back .
Did you ever see anything so funny ?
And those

tremendous wooden shoes too .
I declare she

’s a beauty I

”

“ Oh , they are only b ack-country folk I

” said Lambert ,

rather impatiently .

“ You might as well let old Boer

h aav e drop , or else shut your eyes .

”

“ Ha, ha !
Well , I was going to say, all the big men

136
HANS
BRINKER

What are the Blue Stairs , Lambert ?

” asked Ben .

They are the highest point of the Dunes .
You have

a grand view of the ocean from there, besides a ﬁne
chance to see how wonderful these Dunes are .
One
c an

hardly believe that the wind could ever heap up sand in
so remarkable a way .
But we have to go through Bloe

mend al to get there,

—
not a very pretty Village, and some

distance from here .
What do you say ?

”

“ Oh I I am ready for anything .
For my part , I would

rather steer direct for Leyden ; but we

’ll do as the cap

tain says

— hey, Jacob

“ Ya , dat ish goot,
said Jacob , who felt decidedly

more like taking another nap than ascending the Blue
Stairs .

The captain was in favor of going to Leyden .

It

’s four long miles from here .
(Full sixteen of your

English miles , Benjamin .)
We have no time to lose, if

you wish to reach there before midnight .
Decide quickly,

boys ,

— Blue Stairs , or Leyden

Leyden ,

” they answered , and were out of Haarlem

in a twinkling, admiring the lofty tower-like windmills
and pretty country-seats as they left the city behind
them .

“ If you really wish to see Haarlem ,
said Lambert

to Ben, after they had skated a while in silence,

“ you

should visit it in summer .
It is the greatest place in the

world for beautiful ﬂowers .
The walks around
the city

are superb ; and the

‘ Wood

’ with its miles of noble elms,

THE MAN WITH FOUR HEADS
137

all in full feather, is something to remember .
You need

not smile, old fellow, at my saying

‘ full feather

’

: I was

thinking of waving plumes , and got my words mixed up
a little
.
But a Dutch elm beats everything :
it is the

noblest tree on earth , Ben

—
if you except the English

oak

”

Ay,
said Ben , solemnly ,
if you except the English

oak .
And for some moments he could scarcely see the

canal , because Robby and Jenny kept bobbing in the
air before his eyes .

XVIII

FRIENDS IN NEED

MEANTIME the other boys were listening to Peter

’s

account of an incident which had long ago occurred1

in a part of the city where stood an ancient castle, whose
lord had tyrannized over the burghers of the town to
such an extent that they surrounded his castle, and
laid siege to it .
Just at the last extremity, when the

haughty lord felt that he could hold out no longer, and

w a s preparing to sell his life as
clearly as possible, his

lady appeared on the ramparts , and offered t o surrender
everything, provided she was permitted to bring out,
and retain , as much of her most precious household goods
as she could carry upon her back .
The p romise was

given ; and forth came the lady from the gateway, bear
ing her husband upon her shoulders .
Th e burghers

’

pledge preserved him from the fury of the troops, but
left
them
free
to
wreak
their
vengeance
upon
the

castle .

died nearly two hundred years ago, there are traditions
still aﬂoat concerning his pleasant laugh .
He was a

great painter ; and he had a wife as cross as Xantippe .

”

“ They
balanced
each
other
ﬁnely ,

”
said
Ludwig

he w as kind , and she was cross .
But , Peter, before I

forget it, wasn

’t that picture of St . Hubert and the Horse

painted by Wo uv erm ans?
You remember father showed

us an engraving from it , l ast night .

”

“ Yes, indeed !
There is a story connected with that

picture .

”

“ Tell us I

” cried two or three, drawing closer to Peter

as they skated on .

Wouv erm ans,

” began the captain , oratorically,
was

born in
1620, just four years before Berghem .
He was

a master of his art, and especially excelled in painting
horses .
Strange as it may seem , people were so long

ﬁnding out his merits that , even after he had arrived at
the height of his excellence, he was obliged to sell his
pictures for very paltry prices .
The poor artist became

completely discouraged , and , worse than all, was over
head and ears in debt .
One day he was talking over his

troubles with his father-confessor, who was one of the
few wh o recognized his genius .
The priest determined

to assist him , and accordingly lent him six
h undi ed

guilders, advising him , at the same time, to demand a
better price for his pictures .
Wo u v erm ans did so, and

in the meantime paid his debts .
Matters brightened

with him at once .

‘ Everybody appreciated the great

14 1

artist who painted such costly pictures .
He grew rich .

The six hundred guilders were returned ; and , in gratitude,
Wouv erm ans sent also a work which he had painted ,
representing his benefactor as St . Hubert kneeling b e
fore his horse,

— the very picture, Ludwig, of which w e

were speaking last night .

”

“ So, so !

” exclaimed Ludwig, with deep interest,
I

must take another look at the engraving as soon as we
get home .

”

At that same hour, while Ben was skating with his

companions beside the Holland dike , Robby and Jenny
stood in their pretty English schoolhouse, ready to join
in the duties of their reading class .

“ Commence, Master Robert Dobbs ,
said the teacher .

And Robby , in a quick, childish voice, roared forth at

school-room pitch

LESSON 62 .

—
THE HERO
OF HAARLEM .

Many years ago, there lived in Haarlem, one of the

principal cities of Holland , a sunny-haired boy of gentle
disposition .
His father w as a
slui cer ;
that is , a man

Whose business it was to open and close the sluices , or
large oaken gates that are placed at regular distances
across the entrance of the canals to regulate the amount
of water that shall ﬂow into them .

“ The sluicer raises the gates more or less, according

142
HANS
BRINKER

to the quantity of water required , and closes them care
fully
ar night, in order to avoid all possible danger of an

over-supply running into the canal , or the water would
soon overﬂow it, and inundate the surrounding country .
As a great portion of Holland is lower than the level of
the sea, the waters are kept from ﬂooding the land only
by means of strong dikes , or barriers , and by means of
these sluices, which are often strained to the utmost by
the pressure of the rising tides .
Even the little children

in Holland know that constant watchfulness is required
to keep the rivers and ocean from overwhelming the
country, and that a moment

’s neglect of the
sluicer

’

s

duty may bring ruin and death to all

”

!

“ Very good ,
said the teacher .
Now, Susan .

One lovely autumn afternoon , when the boy was

about eight years old , he obtained his parents

’ consent

to carry some cakes to a blind man who lived out in the
country, on the other side of the dike .
The little fellow

started on his errand with a light heart, and , having
spent an hour with his grateful old friend , he bade him
farewell, and started on his homeward walk .

“ Trudging stoutly along by the canal, he noticed how

the autumn rains had swollen the waters .
Even while

humming his careless , childish song, he thought of his
father

’s brave old gates , and felt glad of their strength ;

for, thought he,

‘ if they gave way, where would father

and mother h e ?
These pretty ﬁelds would be all covered

with the angry waters .
Father always calls them the

144
HANS BRINKER

Quick as a ﬂash , he saw his duty .
Throwing away

his ﬂowers, the boy clambered up the heights until he
reached the hole .
His chubby little ﬁnger was thrust

in , almost before he knew it .
The ﬂowing was stopped !

‘ Ah I

’ he thought , with a chuckle of boyish delight,

‘ the

angry waters must stay back now !
Haarlem shall not

be drowned while I am here I

’

“ This was all very well at ﬁrst ;
but the night w as

falling rapidly .
Chill vapors ﬁlled the air .
Our little

hero began to tremble with cold and dread .
He shouted

loudly ;
he screamed ,

‘ Come here, come here !

’ but no

one came .
The cold grew more intense .
A numbness,

commencing in the tired little ﬁnger, crept over his hand
and arm ; and soon his whole body was ﬁlled with pain .
He shouted again ,

‘ Will no one come
Mother, mother

Alas !
his mother, good , practical soul , had
already

locked the doors , and had fully resolved to scold him on
the morrow for spending the night with blind Jansen
without her permission .
He tried to whistle .
Perhaps

some straggling boy might heed the signal ; but his teeth
chattered so, it was impossible .
Then he called on God

for help ; and the answer came through a holy resolution,

‘ I will stay here till morning .

’

Now, Jenny Dobbs ,

” said the teacher .
Jenny

’s eyes

were
glistening ;
but
she
took
a
long
breath ,
and

commenced !

“ The midnight moon looked down upon that small

solitary form , sitting upon a stone, half-way up the dike .

FRIENDS IN NEED
145

His head was bent, but he was not asleep ;
for, every

now and then, one restless hand rubbed feebly the out
stretched arm that seemed fastened to the dike ;
and

often
the pale, tearful face turned quickly at some real

or fancied sound .

“ How c an we know the sufferings of that long and fear

ful watch

— what falterings of purpose, what childish

terrors , came over the boy as he thought of the warm
little bed at home, of his parents, his brothers and sisters,
then looked into the cold , dreary night I If he drew away
that tiny ﬁnger, the angry waters , grown angrier still,
would rush forth , and never stop until they had swept
over the town .
No : he would hold it there till daylight

if he lived .
He was not very sure of living .
What did

this strange buzzing mean ?
And then the knives , that

seemed pricking and piercing him from head to foot ?
He w as not certain now that he could draw his ﬁnger
away, even if he wished to .

“At daybreak a clergyman , returning from the bed

side
of a sick parishioner, thought he heard groans as he

walked along on the top of the dike .
Bending, he saw,

far down on the side, a child , apparently writhing with
pain .

“ ‘ In the name of wonder, boy,

’ he exclaimed ,

‘ what

are you doing there ?

’

“
‘ I am keeping the water from running out,

’
w as

the simple answer of the little hero .

‘ Tell them to come

quick .

’

146
HANS
BRINKER

It is needless to add that they did come
quickly,

and that

!

“ Jenny Dobbs ,
said the teacher, rather impatiently,

if you cannot control your feelings so as to read dis

tinctly, we will wait until you recover yourself.

”

“ Yes , sir,

” said Jenny, quite startled !

It was strange ;
but , at that very moment , Ben, far

over the sea , w a s saying to Lambert ,

“The noble little fellow !
I have frequently met with

an account of the incident ;
but I never knew till now

that it w a s really true .

“ True !
Of course it is ,
said Lambert , kindling .
I

have given you the story just as mother told it to me,
years ago .
Why, there is not a child in Holland who does

not know it .
And , Ben , you may not think so ; but that

little boy represents the spirit of the whole country .
Not a leak c an show itself anywhere, either in its politics,
honor, or public safety, that a million ﬁngers are not
ready to stop it , at any cost .

”

“ Whew !

” cried Master Ben :
big talking that !

It

’s
tr u e talk, anyway,
rejoined Lambert , so very

quietly that Ben wisely resolved to make no further
comment .

148
HANS BRINKER

ruddy with exercise : in short, every quaint and comical
mixture of dry-goods and ﬂesh that Holland could furnish
seemed sent to enliven the scene .

There were belles from Leyden , and ﬁshwiv es from the

border villages ;
cheese-women from Gouda , and prim

matrons from beautiful country-seats on the Haarlem
mer Meer .
Grey-headed skaters were constantly to be

seen ; wrinkled old women with baskets upon their heads ;
and plump little toddlers on skates , clutching at their
mother

’s gowns .
Some women carried their babies upon

their backs , ﬁrmly secured with a bright shawl .
The

effect was pretty and graceful as they darted by, or
sailed slowly past, now nodding to an acquaintance, now
chirruping, and throwing soft baby-talk, to the mufﬂed
little ones they carried .

Boys and girls were chasing each other, and hiding

behind the one-horse sleds that , loaded high with peat
or timber, pursued their cautious way along the track
marked out as

“ safe .

”
Beautiful , queenly women were

there, enjoyment sparkling in their quiet eyes .
Some

times
a long ﬁle of young men , each grasping the coat

of the one before him , ﬂew by with electric speed ;
and

sometimes the ice squeaked under the chair of some
gorgeous old dowager, or rich burgomaster

’s lady, who,

very red in the nose and sharp in the eyes, looked like
a scare-thaw invented by old Father Winter for the
protection of his skating grounds .
The chair would be

heavy with foot-stoves and cushions, to say nothing of

ON THE CANAL
149

the old lady .
Mounted upon shining runners , it slid

along, pushed by the sleepiest of servants, wh o , looking
neither to the right nor the left, bent himself to his task ,
while
she cast direful glances upon the screaming little

rowdies who invariably acted as body-guard .

As for the men , they were pictures of placid enjoy

ment .
Some were attired in ordinary citizen

’s dress ;

but many looked odd enough with their short woollen
coats, wide breeches and big silver buckles .
These seemed

to Ben like little boys , wh o had , by a miracle, sprung sud

d enly into manhood , and were forced to wear garments
that their astonished mothers had altered in a hurry .
He noticed , too , that nearly all the men had pipes, as
they passed him , whizzing and smoking like so many
locomotives .
There was every variety of pipes, from

those of common clay to the most expensive meerschaums
mounted in silver and gold .
Some were carved into

extraordinary and fantastic shapes , representing birds ,
ﬂowers, heads , bugs and dozens of other things ;
some

resembled the
Dutchman

’s pipe,
that grows in our

American woods ;
some were red , and many were of a

pure, snowy white ; but the most respectable were those
which were ripening into a shaded brown .
The deeper

and richer the brown , of course, the more honored the
pipe ; for it was a proof that the owner, if honestly shad
ing it , was deliberately devoting his manhood to the
effort .
What pipe would not be proud to h e the object

of such a sacriﬁce !

1 50
HANS BRINKER

For a while, Ben skated on in silence .
There was so

much to engage his attention that he almost forgot his
companions .
Part of the time he had been watching

the ice-boats as they ﬂew over the great Ha a rlemmer
Meer (or lake) , the frozen surface of which was now
plainly visible from the canal .
These boats h ad very

large sails ,

— much larger, in proportion , than those of

ordinary vessels ,

—
and were set upon a triangular frame,

furnished with an iron

“ runner
at each corner ;
the

widest part of the triangle crossing the bow, and its
point stretching beyond the stern .
They had rudders

for guiding, and brakes for arresting their progress ; and
were of all sizes and kinds , from small, rough affairs,
managed by a boy, to large and beautiful ones ﬁlled with
gay pleasure-parties , and manned by competent sailors,

who , smoking their
Stumpy pipes , reefed and tacked

and steered with great solemnity and precision .

Some of the boats were painted and gilded in gaudy

style, and ﬂaunted gay pennons fr om

'

th eir mastheads ;

others , white as snow, with every spotless sail rounded
by the wind , looked like swans borne onward by a resist
less current .
It seemed to Ben , as , following his fancy,

he watched one of these in the distance, that he could
almost hear its helpless , terriﬁed
cry; but he soon found

that the sound arose from a nearer and less romantic
cause,

-from an ice-boat , not ﬁfty yards from him , using

its brakes to avoid a collison with a peat-sled .

It was a rare thing for these boats to be upon the

152
HANS
BRINKER

safe to kiss the dear faces that for an instant had ﬂashed
before him one by one,

-father, mother, Robby and

Jenny :
that great boom had dashed their images into

his very soul .
He knew now how much he loved them .

Perhaps this knowledge made him face complacently the
scowls of those on the canal who seemed to feel that a
boy in danger was necessarily a bad boy, needing instant
reprimand .

Lambert chided him roundly .

I thought it was all over with you, you careless fel

low !
Why don

’t you look where you are going ?
Not

content with sitting on all the old ladies

’ laps, you must

make a Juggernaut of every ice-boat that comes along .
We shall have to hand you over to the
a a nsp r eeker s yet,

if you don

’t look out I

”

Please don

’t ,

” said Ben , with mock humility ; then ,

seeing how pale Lambert

’s lips were, added in a low

tone,

“ I do believe I thought more in that one moment, Van

M ounen, than in all the rest of my past life .

”

There was no reply ;
and , for a while, the two boys

skated on in silence .

Soon a faint sound of distant bells reached their ears .

Hark !

” said Ben .
What is that ? ”

The
ca r illons,
replied Lambert .
They are trying

the bells in the chapel of yonder Village .
Ah , Ben ! you

should hear the chimes of the

‘ New Church

’ at Delft .
.

They are superb ,

— nearly ﬁv e hundred sweet-toned bells,

ON THE CANAL
1 53

and one of the best
ca r illoneu r s of Holland to play upon

them .
Hard work, though :
they say the fellow often

has to go to bed from positive exhaustion after his per

fo rm ances .

' You see, the bells are attached to a kind of

key-board , something like they have on piano-fortes
there are also a set of pedals for the feet .
When a brisk

tune is going on , the player looks like a kicking frog
fastened to his seat with a skewer .

”

“ For shame I

” said Ben , indignantly .

Peter had , for the present, exhausted his stock of

Haarlem anecdotes ; and now, having nothing to do but
to skate, he and his three companions were hastening
to

“ catch up

” with Lambert and Ben .

That English lad is ﬂeet enough ,

” said Peter .
If

he were a born Hollander, he could do no better .
Gen

er ally these John Bulls make but a sorry ﬁgure on skates .

Halloo I Here you are, Van M ounen :
why, we hardly

hoped for the honor of meeting you again .
Whom were

you ﬂying from in such haste ?

”

“ Snails ,
retorted Lambert .
What kept you ?

We have been talking ; and , besides, we halted once

to give Poot a chance to rest .

”

“ He begins to look rather worn out,
said Lambert,

in a low voice .

Just then a beautiful ice-boat , with reefed sail and

ﬂying streamers , swept leisurely by .
Its deck was ﬁlled

with children mufﬂed up to their chins .
Looking at them

from the ice, you could see only smiling little faces em

1 54
HANS BRINKER

bedded in bright-colored woollen wrappings . They we re
singing a chorus in honor of St . Nicholas .
The music,

starting in the discord of a hundred childish voices,
ﬂoated , as it rose, into exquisite harmony

'

chance ; but to abandon so shamefully their grand under
taking

— who could think of such a thing ?

An animated discussion arose at once .
Captain Peter brought his party to a halt .

Boys,

” said he,

“ it strikes me that we should consult

Jacob

’s wishes in this matter .
He started the excursion,

you know .

”

“ Pooh I

” sneered Carl, throwing a contemptuous glance

at
Jacob .

“ Who

’s
tired ?
We
can
rest
all
night

at Leyden .

Ludwig and Lambert looked anxious and disappointed .

It was no slight thing to lose the credit of having skated
all the way from Broek to the Hague, and back again ;
but both agreed that Jacob should decide the question .

Good-natured , tired Jacob ! He read the popular sen

riment at a glance .

“ Oh , no !

” he said in Dutch .
I was joking .
We

will skate, of course .

”

The boys gave a delighted shout, and started on again

with renewed vigor .

All but Jacob .
He tried his best not to seem fatigued ,

and , by not saying a word , saved his breath and energy
for the great business of skating .
But in vain .
Before

long, the stout body grew heavier and heavier ; the tot
tering limbs, weaker and weaker .
Worse than all, the

blood , anxious to get as far as possible from the ice,
mounted to the p uffy, good -natured cheeks , and made
the roots of his thin , yellow hair glow into a ﬁery red .

JACOB POOT CHANGES THE PLAN
1 57

This kind of work is apt to summon vertigo, of whom

good Hans Andersen writes ,

—the same who hurls daring

young hunters from the mountains, or spins them from
the sharpest heights of the glaciers , or catches them as
they tread the stepping-stones of the mountain torrent .

Vertigo came, unseen , to Jacob .
After tormenting

him a while, with one touch sending a chill from head to
foot , with the next scorching every vein with fever, she
made the canal rock and tremble beneath him , the white
sails bow and spin as they passed , then cast him heavily
upon the ice .

“ Halloo I

” cried Van Moumen .
There goes Poot !

Ben sprang hastily fo rward .

“ Jacob , Jacob , are you hurt ?
Peter and Carl were lifting him .
The face was white

enough now .
It seemed like a dead face ; even the good

natured look was gone .

A crowd collected .
Peter unbuttoned the poor boy

’s

jacket, loosened his red tippet, and blew between the
parted lips .

“ Stand
Off , good people I

” he cried .
Give him air !

Lay him down ,

” called out a woman from the crowd .

Stand him upon his feet ,

” shouted another .

Give him wine,
growled a stout fellow who was

driving a loaded sled .

“ Yes, yes, give him wine I

” echoed everybody .

Ludwig and Lambert shouted in concert,

Wine, wine !
Who has wine

1 58
HANS BRINKER

A sleepy-eyed Dutchman began to fumble mysteriously

under the heaviest of blue jackets, saying, as he did

so,

“ Not so much noise, young masters ;
not so much

noise !
The boy w as a fool to faint
off like a girl .

“ Wine, quick !

” cried Peter, who, with Ben

’s help ,

w as rubbing Jacob from head to foot .

Ludwig stretched forth his hand imploringly toward

the Dutchman ,
wh o, with an air of great importance,

w a s still fumbling beneath the jacket .

“ Do hurry !
He will die !
Has any one else any wine ?

He is dead !

” said an awful voice from among the

bystanders .

This startled the Dutchman .

“ Have a care !

” he said , reluctantly drawing forth a

small blue ﬂask .
This is schnapps .
A little is enough .

”

A little
was enough .
The paleness gave way to a

faint ﬂush .
Jacob opened his eyes, and , half bewildered ,

half ashamed , feebly tried to free himself from those wh o
were supporting him .

There was no alternative, now, for our party, but to

have their exhausted comrade carried in some way to
Leyden .
As for expecting him to skate any more that

day, the thing was impossible .
In truth , by this time

each boy began to entertain secret yearnings toward

ice-boats, and to avow a Spartan resolve not to desert
Jacob .
Fortunately a gentle, steady breeze was setting

160
HANS BRINKER

HOW m any ?
Six .

”

Well, it

’s Nicholas Day—
up with you ! Young gentle

man sick !nodding toward Jacob!

“ Yes , broken down— skated all the way from Broek,

answered Peter .

“ Do you go to Leyden

“That

’s as the wind says .
It

’s blowing that w ay now .

Scramble up I

”

Poor Jacob ! if that willing Mrs . Poot had only
ap

p ear ed just then , her services would have been invaluable .
It was as much as the boys could do to hoist him into
the boat .
All were in at last .
The schipp er , puffing away

at his pipe, let out the sail, lifted the brake, and sat in
the stem with folded arms .

“ Whew !
How fast
we go !

” cried Ben .
This is

something like .
Feel better, Jacob ?

”

“ Much petter, I tanks you .

”

Oh !
You

’ll be as good as new in ten minutes .
This

makes a fellow feel like a bird .

Jacob nodded , and blinked his eyes .

Don

’t go to sleep , Jacob ; it

’s too cold .
You might

never wake up , you know .
Persons often freeze to death

in that w ay

“ I no sleep ,
said Jacob , conﬁdently .
And in two

minutes he was snoring .

Carl and Ludwig laughed .

“ We must wake him I

” cried Ben .
It is dangerous ,

I tell you .
Jacob !
Ja-a-c

Captain Peter interfered ;
for three of the boys were

helping Ben for the fun of the thing .

“ Nonsense !
Don

’t shake him !
Let him alone, boys !

One never snores like that when one

’s freezing .
Cover

him up with something .
Here, this cloak will do .

Hey,

” and

' he looked toward the stern for

permission to use it .

The man nodded .

“ There,

” said Peter, tenderly adjusting the garment

let him sleep .
He will be frisky as a lamb when he wakes .

How far are we from Leyden ,
schipp er ?

“ Not more

’n a couple of pipes ,

” replied a voice, rising

from smoke, like the genii in fairy-tales (puff , puff) ;

“ likely, not more

’n one an

’ a half

” (puff , puff) ,

“ if this

wind holds

” (puff , puff , p uff)

.

“ What is the man saying, Lambert ?

” asked Ben , wh o

w as holding his mittened hands against his cheeks to
ward
off the cutting air .

“ He says we

’re about two pipes from Leyden .
Half

the boors here on the canal measure distances by the
time it takes them to ﬁnish a pipe .

”

“ How ridiculous I

”

See

retorted
Lambert,

growing unaccountably indignant at Ben

’s quiet smile,

“ see here .

It may suit you , this word ; but it don

custom of making the Lord-Mayor of London , at his
installation , count the nails in a horseshoe to prove his

lea r ning

.

”

“ Who told you we had any such custom as that ?

cried Ben , looking grave in an instant .

“ Why, I know it : no use of any one telling me .
It

’s

in all the books ; and it

’s true .
It strikes me,

” continued

Lambert , laughing in spite of himself,

“ that you have

been kept in happy ignorance of a good many ridiculous
things on you r side of the map .

”

“ Humph I

” exclaimed Ben , trying not to smile .

“ I

’ll

inquire into that lord-mayor business when I get home .
There must be some mistake .
B-r-r —r oooo I
How fast

we

’re going !
This is glorious !

It w as a grand sail , or ride, I scarce know which to call

it : perhaps

“ ﬂy ” would be the best word ; for the boys

felt very much as Sindbad did , when, tied to the roc

’s

leg, he darted through the clouds ;
or as Bellerophon

felt when he shot through the air on the back of his
winged horse, Pegasus .
Sailing, riding or ﬂying, which

ever
ir was , everything
w as rushing past, backward ;

and , before they had time to draw a long breath , Leyden
itself, with its high-peaked roofs , ﬂew half-way to meet
them .

When the city came in sight , it w as high time t o waken

boys soon found an unpretending establishment

near the

(Broad

a funnily

painted lion over the door .
This wa s the Rood-Leeuw,

or Red Lion , kept by one Huygens Kleef, a stout Dutch
man with short legs and a very long pipe .

By this time they were in a ravenous condition .
The

tiﬁin taken at Haarlem had served only to give them an
appetite ; and this had been heightened by their exercise
and swift sail upon the canal .

Come, mine host , give us what you can I cried Peter,

rather pompously .

“ I

answered

Mynheer Kleef, performing a difficult bow .

Well, give us sausage and pudding .

Ah , mynheer ! the sausage is all gone .
There is no

“ Salmagundi , then, and plenty of it

“ No eggs ?

The Dutchman raised his fat hands .

Ca viar e!
That is made of gold ! Wh o has

Peter had sometimes eaten it at home .
He knew that

it was made of the Toes of the sturgeon and certain other
large ﬁsh ; but he had no idea of its cost .

“ Well, mine host, what have you ?

”

What have I ?
Everything .
I have rye-bread , sour

krout , potato-salad , and the fattest herring in Leyden .

”

“ What do you say, boys ?

” asked the captain .
Will

that do ?

”

“ Yes ,

” cried the famished youths,
if he

’ll only be

quick .

”

Mynheer moved
off like one walking in his sleep , but

soon opened his eyes wide at the miraculous manner in
which his herring were made to disappear .
Next came,

or rather went, potato-salad , rye-bread and coffee, then
Utrecht water ﬂavored with orange, and , ﬁnally, slices
of dry gingerbread .
This last delicacy w as not on the

regular bill of fare ;
but Mynheer Kleef, driven t o ex

tremes , solemnly produced it from his own private stores,
and gave only a placid blink when his voracious young
travellers started up , declaring they had eaten enough .

“ I should think so I

” he exclaimed internally ; but his

smooth face gave no Sign .

168

BRINKER

Order !

” cried the captain .
Now, boys , I must

seek this great Dr . B oekman before I sleep .
If he is in

Leyden, it will be no great task to ﬁnd him ; for he always
puts up at the Golden Eagle when he comes here .
I

wonder that you did not all go to bed at once .
Still , as

you are awake, what say you to walking with Ben up
by the Museum or the St adh uis

“Agreed ,

” said Ludwig and Lambert ; but Jacob pre

ferred to go with Peter .
In vain Ben tried to persuade

him to remain at the inn , and rest .
He declared that he

never felt

“ petter,
and wished , of all things , to take a

look at the city ; for it was his ﬁrst

“ stop mit Leyden .

”

“ Oh , it will not harm him I

” said Lambert .

“ How long

the day has been ! and what glorious sport w e have had !
It hardly seems possible that we left Broek only this
morning .

Jacob yawned .

“ I have enjoyed it well,
he said ;
but it seems to me

at least a week since we started .

”

Carl laughed , and muttered something about
twenty

naps

”

Here we are at the corner .
Remember, we all meet

at the Red Lion at eight,

” said the captain, as he and

Jacob walked away .

THE RED LION BECOMES DANGEROUS

THE boys were glad to ﬁnd a blazing ﬁre awaiting

them upon their return to the Red Lion .
Carl and his

party were there ﬁrst .
Soon afterward , Peter and Jacob

came in .
They had inquired in vain concerning Dr .

Bockman .
All they could ascertain was, that he had

been seen in Haarlem that morning .

“ As for his
b eing

' in Leyden ,

” the landlord of the

Golden Eagle had said to Peter,

“ the thing is impossible .

He always lodges here when in town .
By this time,

there would be a crowd at my door, waiting to con
sult
him .
Bah !
people
make
such
fools
of them

selves !

”

“ He is called a

' great surgeon,
said Peter .

Yes , the greatest in Holland .
But what of that ?

What of being the greatest pill-choker and knife-slasher
in the world ?
The man is a
hear .
Only last month ,

on this very spot, he called me a
pig before
three

customers I

”

179
HANS
BRINKER

NO I

” exclaimed Peter, trying to look surprised and

indignant .

“ Yes , master,

—
a pig,
repeated the landlord , p uﬂi ng

at his pipe with an injured air .

“ Bah ! if he did not pay

ﬁne prices , and bring customers to my house, I would
sooner
see
him
in
the
Vleit
Canal
than
give
him

lodgement .

”

Perhaps mine host felt that he was speaking too openly

to a
Stranger ;
or it may be he saw a smile lurking in

Peter

’s face, for he added sharply,

“ Come, now, what more do you wish ?
Supper ?

Beds

“

1No, mynheer .
I am but searching for Dr . Bockman .

Go ﬁnd him .
He is not in Leyden .

”

Peter was not to be put
Off so

!easily .
After receiving

a few more rough words , he succeeded in obtaining per
mission to leave

“ a note for the famous surgeon ;
or,

rather, he bought from his amiable landlord the privilege
of writing it there, and
a promise that it should be

promptly delivered when Dr .
Bockman arrived .
This

accomplished , Peter and Jacob returned to the Red Lion .

This inn had once been a ﬁne house, the home of a

rich burgher ; but , having grown old and shabby, it had
passed through many hands , until, ﬁnally, it had fallen
into the possession of Mynheer Kleef.
He was fond of

saying, as he looked up at its dingy , broken walls ,

“ Mend

it, and paint it, and there

’s not a prettier house in Ley

street .

as soap and sand
can make it .
Next, picture two sleepy,

shabby-looking men in wooden shoes ,

-one seated near

the glowing ﬁreplace, smoking a broken pipe, the other
pacing the
room
restlessly ;
Mynheer
Kleef walking

softly and heavily about , clad in leather knee-breeches,
felt shoes , and a green jacket wider than it is long ;
then throw a heap of skates in the corner, and put
six tired , well-dressed boys , in various attitudes, upon
the wooden chairs ,

— and you will see the coffee-room

of the Red Lion just as it appeared at nine o

’clock

on the evening of December
6,
184

‘
For supper,

gingerbread again , slices of Dutch sausage, rye-bread
sprinkled with anise—seed , pickles , a bottle of Utrecht
water, and a pot of very mysterious coffee .
The boys

were ravenous enough to take all they could get , and
pronounce it excellent .
Ben made w ry faces ; but Jacob

declared he had never eaten a better meal .
After they

had laughed and talked a while, and counted their money,
by
w ay of settling a discussion that arose concerning

their expenses , the captain marched his company
off to

bed , led on by a greasy pioneer-boy, wh o carried skates
and a candlestick, instead of an axe .

One of the ill-favored men by the ﬁre had shufﬂed

toward the dresser, and was ordering a mug of beer, just
as Ludwig, wh o brought up the rear, was stepping from
the apartment .

“ I don

’t like that fellow

’s eye,
he whispered to Carl .

He looks like a pirate, or something of that kind .

THE
RED LION BECOMES DANGEROUS
173

“ Looks like a granny !

”
answered
Carl, in
sleepy

disdain .

Ludwig laughed uneasily

Granny,or no granny,
he whispered ,
I tell you,

he looks just like one of those men in the voetsp oelen .

Pooh !

” sneered

‘Carl .

“ I knew it .
That picture

w as too much for y ou .
Look sharp ,
now , and see if

yon fellow with the candle doesn

’t look like the other

Villain .

”

“ No ! indeed .
His face is as honest as a Gouda cheese .

But I say, Carl , that really w as a horrid picture .

”

“ Humph !
What did you stare at it so long for ?

I couldn

’t help it .

”

By this time, the boys had reached the
beautiful

A dumpy little maiden ,

with long earrings, met them at the doorway , dropped
them a courtesy, and passed out .
She carried a long

handled thing that resembled a frying-pan with a cover .

“ I am glad to see that ,

” said Van Mounen to Ben .

What ?

”

Why, the warming-pan .
It

’s full of hot ashes .
She

’s

been heating our beds .

“ Oh , a warming-pan , eh !
Much obliged to her, I

’m

room with three beds in it .

’

sure,

” said Ben , too sleepy to make any further comment .

Meantime, Ludwig still talked of the picture that had

made such a strong impression upon him .
He had seen

it in a shop-window during their walk .
It was a poorly

painted thing, representing two men , tied back to back,

174
HANS
BRINKER

standing on shipboard , surrounded by a group of seamen,

wh o were preparing to cast them together into the sea .
This mode of putting prisoners to death
w as called

voetspoelen, or feet-washing, and
w a s practised by the

Dutch upon the pirates of Dunkirk in
1605, and again

by the Spaniards upon the Dutch , in the horrible mas
sacre that followed the siege of Haarlem .
Bad as the

painting w as, the expression upon the pirates

’ faces w as

well given .
Sullen and despairing as they seemed , they

wore such a cruel , malignant aspect , that Ludwig had
felt a secret satisfaction in contemplating their helpless
condition .
He might have forgotten the scene by this

time, but for that ill-looking man by the ﬁre .
Now

while he capered about , boy-like,
a nd threw himself

with an antic into his bed , he inwardly hoped that the

voetsp oelen would not haunt his dreams .

It was a cold , cheerless room .
A ﬁre had been newly

kindled in the burnished stove, and seemed to shiver
even while it w a s trying to burn .
The windows , with

their funny little panes , were bare and shiny ;
and the

cold , waxed ﬂoor looked like a sheet of yellow ice .
Three

rush-bottomed
chairs
stood
stiffly
against
the
wall,

alternating with three narrow wooden bedsteads, that
made the room look like the deserted ward of a hospital .
At any other time the boys would have found it quite
impossible to sleep in pairs , especially in such narrow
quarters ; but to-Iiight they lost all fear of being crowded ,
and longed only to lay their weary bodies upon the

176
HANS BRINKER

a poor lookout .
During the early hours of the night ,

Jacob Poot had been gradually but surely winding him
self with all the bed-covers .
He now lay like a monster

Chrysalis beside the half-frozen Peter, who, accordingly,

w a s skating with all his might over the coldest , bleakest,
of dreamland icebergs .

Something else, I
say, besides the moonlight,
w as

moving
across the bare, polished
ﬂoor ,

— moving not

quite so slowly, but quite as stealthily .

Wake up , Ludwig !
The
voetsp oelen pirate is growing

real .

No .
Ludwig does not waken ;
but he moans in his

sleep .

Does not Carl hear it
— Carl, the brave, the fear

less .

No .
Carl is dreaming of the race .

And Jacob ?
Van Moumen ?
Ben ?

Not they .
They, too, are dreaming of the race ; and

Katrinka
is
singing
through
their
dreams ,
laughing,

ﬂitting past them .
Now and then a wave from the

great organ surges through their midst .

Still the thing moves , slowly, slowly .
Peter !
Captain Peter, there is danger !

Peter heard no call .
But , in his dream , he slid a few

thousand feet from one iceberg to another ;
and the

shock awoke him .

Whew !
How cold he
w a s !
He gave a hopeless,

desperate tug at the Chrysalis .
In vain : sheet, blanket

and spread were ﬁrmly wound about Jacob

’s inanimate

form .
Peter looked drowsily toward the window .

he
thought ;

“we
shall
have

pleasant weather to-morrow .
Halloo I What

’s that ?

”

Clear
moonlight ,

He saw the moving thing, or, rather, something black

crouching upon the

“ ﬂoor ;
for it had halted as Peter

stirred .

He watched in silence .
Soon it moved again , nearer and nearer .
It was a man

crawling upon hands and feet .

The captain

’s ﬁrst impulse was to call out ;
but he

took an instant to consider matters .

The creeper had a shining knife in one hand .
This

w as ugly ; but Peter w as naturally self-possessed .
When

the head turned , Peter

’s eyes were closed , as if in sleep ;

but , at other times , nothing could be keener, sharper,
than the captain

’s gaze .

Closer, closer, crept the robber .
His back w as very

near Peter now .
The knife was laid softly upon the ﬂoor .

One careful arm reached forth stealthily to drag the
clothes from the chair by the captain

’s bed .
The robbery

wa s commenced .

Now was Peter

’s time .
Holding his breath , he sprang

up , and leaped with all his strength upon the robber

’s

back, stunning the rascal with the force of the blow .
To

seize the knife w as but a second

’s work .
The robber

began to struggle ; but Peter sat like a giant astride the
prostrate form .

178
HANS
BRINKER

If you stir,
said the brave boy in as terrible a voice

as he could command ,

“ stir but one inch , I will plunge

this knife into your neck .
Boys , boys !
Wake up !

”

he shouted , still pressing down the black head , and
holding the knife at pricking distance .
Give us a hand !

I

’ve got him !
I

’ve got him I

”

The chrysalis rolled over, but made no other
Sign .

“ Up , boys !

” cried Peter, never budging .

“ Ludwig,

Lambert !
Thunder !
Are you all dead ?

”

Dead ! not they !
Van M ounen and Ben were on their

feet in an instant .

“ Hey ?
What now ?

” they shouted .

“ I

’ve got a robber here,
said Peter, coolly .
Lie

still, you scoundrel , or I

’ll slice your head
of I

— Now,

boys , cut out your bed-cord .
Plenty of time :
he

’s a

dead man if he stirs .

Peter felt that he weighed a thousand pounds .
So

he did , with that knife in his hand .
The man growled

and swore, but dared not move .

Ludwig w as up by this time .
He had a great jack

knife, the pride of his heart, in his breeches

’ pocket .

It could do good service now .
They bared the bedstead

in a moment .
It wa s laced backward and forward with

a rope .

“ I

’ll cut it ,
cried Ludwig, sawing away at the knot .

Hold him
P916 I

”

“ Never fear I

” answered the captain, giving the robber

a warning prick .

I 80
HANS BRINKER

Just at this moment the chrysalis upon the bed stirred ,

and sat erect .

What

’s the matter ?

” he asked , without opening his

eyes .

“ Matter I

” echoed Ludwig, half trembling, half laugh

ing .

“ Get up , Jacob !
Here

’s work for you .
Come sit

on this fellow

’s back while w e get into our clothes : we

’re

half perished .

”

“ What fellow ?
Donder I

Hurrah for Poot I

” cried all the boys, as Jacob , slid

ing quickly to the ﬂoor, bedclothes and all, took in the
state of affairs at a glance, and sat heavily beside Peter
on the robber

’s back .

Oh , didn

’t the fellow groan then !

“ No use in holding him down any longer, boys,
said

Peter, rising, but bending, as he did so, to draw a pistol
from his man

’s belt .

“ You see, I

’ve been keeping guard

over this pretty little weapon for the last ten minutes .
It

’s cocked , and the least wriggle might have set it
off .

No danger now .
I must dress myself.
You and I , Lam

bert , will go for the police .
I

’d no idea it w as so cold .

”

“ Where is Carl ?

” asked one of the boys .

They looked at one another .
Carl certainly was not

among them .

“ Oh I

” cried Ludwig, frightened at last,
where is he ?

Perhaps he

’s had a ﬁght with the robber, and got killed .

“ Not a bit of it ,
said Peter, qui etly, as he buttoned

his stout jacket .

“ Look under the beds .

”

THE RED LION BECOMES DANGEROUS
18 1

They did so .
Carl was not there .

Just then they heard a commotion on the stairway .

Ben hastened to open the door .
The landlord almost

tumbled in : he was armed with a big blunderbuss .
Two

or three lodgers followed ;
then the daughter, with an

upraised frying-pan in one hand , and a candle in the
other ; and behind her, looking pale and frightened , the
gallant Carl .

There

’s your man, mine host ,
said Peter, nodding

toward the prisoner .

Mine host raised his blunderbuss ; the girl screamed ;

and Jacob , more nimble than usual, rolled quickly from
the robber

’s back .

“ Don

’t ﬁre I

” cried Peter :
he is tied , hand and foot .

Let

’s roll him over, and see what he looks like .

”

Carl stepped briskly forward , with a blustering,
Yes .

We

’ll turn him over in a w ay he won

’t like .
Lucky we

’ve

caught him I

”

“ Ha , ha I

” laughed Ludwig :
where were you, Master

Carl ?

”

“ Where
w as I ?

” retorted Carl, angrily .
Why, I

went to give the alarm , to be sure .

”

All the boys exchanged glances ;
but they were too

happy and elated to say anything ill-natured .
Carl

certainly w as bold enough now .
He took the lead , while

three others aided him in turning the helpless man .

While the robber lay, face up , scowling and muttering,

Ludwig took the candlestick from the girl

’s hand .

1 82
HANS
BRINKER

I must have a good look at the beauty,
he said ,

drawing closer ;
but the words were no sooner spoken

than he turned pale, and started so violently that he
almost dropped the candle .

“The
voetsp oelen !

” he cried .
Why, boys, it

’s the

man wh o sat by the ﬁre !

“ Of course it is ,

” answered Peter .
We counted our

money before him like simpletons .
But what have we

to do with
voetsp oelen, Brother Ludwig ?
A month in

jail is punishment enough .

”

The landlord

’s daughter had left the room .
She now

ran in , holding up a pair of huge wooden shoes .

“ See,

father !

” she cried ,

“ here are his great ugly boots .
It

’s

the man that w e put in the next room after the young
masters went to bed .
Ah I it was wrong to send the

poor young gentlemen up here so far out of sight and

soundf

’

“The scoundrel I

” hissed the landlord .
He has dis

graced my house .
I go for the police at once .

”

In less than ﬁfteen minutes , two drowsy-looking oﬂi cer s

were in the room .
After telling Mynheer Kleef that he

must appear early in the morning, with the boys , and
make his complaint before a magistrate, they marched

off with their prisoner .

One would think the captain and his band could have

slept no more that night ; but the mooring has not yet
been found that can prevent youth and an easy conscience
from drifting down the river of dreams .
The boys were

XXIII

BEFORE THE COURT

YO U may believe the landlord

’s daughter bestirred

herself to prepare a good meal for the boys next morn
ing .
Mynheer had a Chinese gong, that could make

more noise than a dozen of breakfast-bells .
Its hideous

r eveille, clanging through the house, generally startled
the drowsiest lodgers into activity ;
but the maiden

would not allow it to be sounded this morning .

“ Let the brave young gentlemen sleep ,

” she said to

the greasy kitchen-boy ;
they shall be warmly fed when

they waken .

”

It was ten o

’clock when Captain Peter and his band

came straggling down , one by one .

“ A pretty hour,

” said mine host , gr ufﬂy

.
It is high

time we were before the court .
Fine business this for a

respectable inn .
You will testify truly, young masters,

that you found most excellent fare and lodgement at
the Red Lion

“ Of course
w e will,
answered Carl, saucily,
and

1 84

185

pleasant company, too, though they Visit at rather
un

seasonable hours

A stare and a
humph

made to this ;
but the daughter Was more Comm unica

tive .
Shaking her ear-rings at Carl, she said sharply,

“ Not so very pleasant, either, master traveller, if one

could judge by the w ay you ran away from it I

”

“ Impertinent creature I

” hissed Carl under his breath ,

as he began busily to examine his skate-straps .
Mean

time the kitchen-boy, listening outside at the crack of
the door, doubled himself with silent laughter .

After breakfast the boys went to the police court,

accompanied by Huygens Kleef and his daughter .
Myn

heer

’s testimony was principally to the effect that such

a thing as a robber at the Red Lion had been unheard
of until last night ;
and , as for the Red Lion , it w a s a

most respectable inn ,

— as respectable as any house in

Leyden .
Each boy, in turn , told all he knew of the

affair, and identiﬁed the prisoner in the box as the same
man who entered their room in the dead of night .
Lud

wig was surprised to ﬁnd that the robber was a man of
ordinary size, especially after he had described him, under
oath , to the court, as a tremendous fellow, with great
square shoulders, and legs of prodigious weight .
Jacob

swore that he was awakened by the robber kicking and
thrashing upon the ﬂoor ;
and , immediately afterward ,

Peter and the rest (feeling sorry that they had not ex

plained the matter to their sleepy
comr ad e)testiﬁed that

I

” w as all the answer mynheer

186
HANS
BRINKER

the man had not moved a muscle from the moment the
point of the dagger touched his throat, until, bound from
head to foot , he was rolled over for inspection .
The land

lord

’s daughter made one boy blush , and all the court

smile, by declaring that,

“ if it hadn

’t been for that hand

some young gentleman there

” (pointing to Peter) , they

“ might have all been murdered in their beds ;
for the

dreadful man had a great shining knife, most as long as
your Honor

’s arm ,

” and
she believed

“ the handsome

young gentleman had struggled hard enough to get it
away from him ; but he was too modest
bless him ! to

say so .

”

Finally, after a little questioning and cross-questioning

from the public prosecutor, the witnesses were dismissed ;
and the robber was handed over to the mercies of the
criminal court .

“ The scoundrel I” said Carl, savagely, when the boys

reached the street .
He ought to be sent to jail at once .

If I had been in your place, Peter, I certainly should
have killed him outright .

“ He was fortunate, then , in falling into gentler hands,

w as Peter

’s quiet reply .

“ It appears he has been arrested

before under a charge of house-breaking .
He did not

succeed in robbing, this time ;
but he broke the door

fastenings, and that, I believe, makes a burglary in the
eye of the law .
He w a s armed with a knife, too ;
a nd

that makes it worse for him , poor fellow .

”

“ Poor fellow !

” mimicked Carl .

“ One would think

he w as your brother .

XXIV

THE BELEAGUERED CITIES

THIS open square before us ,
said Lambert , as he

and Ben walked on together,

“ is pretty in summer, with

its shady trees .
They call it the Ruine .
Years ago it

was covered with houses ;
and the Rapenburg Canal,

here, ran through the street .
Well, one day a barge

loaded with forty thousand pounds of gunpowder, bound
for Delft , w as lying alongside ;
and the bargemen took

a notion to cook their dinner on the deck ;
and , before

any one knew it , sir, the whole thing blew up , killing lots
of persons, and scattering about three hundred houses
to the winds .

”

“ What I

” exclaimed Ben .
Did the explosion destroy

three hundred houses ?

“ Yes , sir .
My father w a s in Leyden at the time .
He

says it
w as terrible .
The explosion occurred just at

noon , and was like a volcano .
All this part of the town

w a s on ﬁre in an instant , buildings tumbling down , and
men , women and children groaning under the ruins .
The

190
HANS
BRINKER

king himself came to the city, and acted nobly, father
says , staying out in the streets all night , encouraging
the survivors in their efforts to arrest the ﬁre, and rescue
as many as possible from under the heaps of stone and
rubbish .
Through his means , a collection for the beneﬁt

of the sufferers was raised throughout the kingdom, b e
sides a hundred thousand guilders paid out of the treasury .
Father was only nineteen years old then (it w a s in
1807,

I believe) ; but he remembers it perfectly .
A friend of

his , Professor Luzac, was among the killed .
They have

a tablet erected to his memory in St . Peter

’s Church ,

further
on,

— the queerest thing you ever
saw, with an

image of the professor carved upon it , representing him
just as he looked when he w a s found after the explosion .

”

“ What a strange idea !
Isn

’t Boerhaave

’s monument

in St . Peter

’s also ?

”

“ I cannot remember .
Perhaps Peter knows .

The captain delighted Ben by saying that the monu

ment was there, and that he thought they might be able
to
see it during the day

“ Lambert,

” continued Peter,
ask Ben if he saw Van

der We rf

’

s portrait at the Town Hall last night ?

”

“ No,

” said Lambert ,

“ I can answer for him .
It w as

too late to go in .
I say, boys , it is really wonderful how

much Ben knows .
Why , he has told me a volume of

Dutch history already .
I

’ll wager he has the siege of

Leyden at his tongue

’s end .

“ His tongue must burn , then,
interposed Ludwig ;

192
HANS

with God

’s help , I mea n to do it !
If my body can satisfy

your hunger, take it , and divide it among you, but expect
no surrender so long as I am alive .

’
Hurrah ! hur

Ben w a s getting uproarious ; Lambert playfully clapped

his hand over his friend

’s mouth .
The result was one of

those quick, india-rubber
scufﬂes, fearful to behold but

delightful to human nature in its polliwog state .

“ Vat wash te matter, Pen ?

” asked Jacob , hurrying

forward .

“ Oh I nothing at all,
panted Ben,
except that Van

Moumen w as afraid of starting an English riot in this
orderly town .
He stopped my cheering for old Van der

“ Ya , ya !

“ See old Van der Does ?

“ Ya !

” responded Jacob .
Van der Werf— vell, vot

of it ?
Both ish just ash goot .

“ Yes , Van der Does w a s a noble old Dutchman ; but

he w as not Van der Werf.
I know he defended the city

like a brick, and

“ Now

“ No, no, no !
I said he defended the city like a brick .

That is very high praise, I would have you understand .
We English call even the Duke of Wellington a brick .

”

Jacob looked puzzled ; but his indignation w as already

on the ebb .

“ Vell, it ish no matter .
I no tink before, soltyer mean

breek ; but it

’ ish no matter .

”

Ben laughed good-naturedly ;
and ,
seeing that his

cousin w a s tired of talking in English , he turned to his
friend of the two languages,

“ Van M ounen , they say the very carrier-pigeons that

brought news of relief to the besieged city are some
where here in Leyden .
I really should like to see them !

Just think of it .
At the very height of the trouble, if

the wind didn

’t turn , and blow in the waters , and drown

hundreds of the Spaniards , and enable the Dutch boats
to sail in right over the land , with men and provisions ,
to the very gates of the city !
The pigeons , you know,

did great service in bearing letters to and fro .
I have

read , somewhere, that they were reverently cared for
from that day ; and , when they died , they were stuffed ,
and placed for safe keeping in the Town Hall .
We must

be sure to have a look at them .

”

Van M ounen laughed .

“ On that principle, Ben , I

suppose, when you go to Rome, you

’ll expect to see the

identical goose th at saved the Capitol .
But it will be

easy enough to see the pigeons .
They are in the same

building with Van der We rf

’

s portrait .
Which w as the

greater defence, Ben ,

— the siege of Leyden , or the siege

of Haarlem

“Well,

” replied Ben , thoughtfully,
Van der Werf is

194
HANS
BRINK ER

one of my heroes .
We all have
o ur historical pets, you

know ; but I really think the siege of Haarlem brought
out a braver, more heroic resistance even , than the Ley
den one ;
besides, they set the Leyden sufferers an ex

ample
of courage and fortitude, for their turn came

ﬁrst .

”

“ I don

’t know much about the Haarlem siege,
said

Lambert ,

“ except that it was in
1 573

.
Who beat ?

“The Spaniards ,

” said Ben .

“ The Dutch had stood

out for months .
Not a man would yield , nor a woman,

either, for that matter .
They shouldered arms, and

fought
gallantly
b eside
their
husbands
and
fathers .

Three hundred of them did duty under Kanau Hesse
laer, a great woman , and brave as Joan of Arc .
All this

time the city w as surrounded by the Spaniards under
Frederick of Toledo , son of that beauty, the Duke of
Alva .
Cut off from all possible help from without , there

seemed to be no hope for the inhabitants ;
but they

shouted deﬁance over the city walls .
They even threw

bread into the enemy

’s camps , to show that theywere

not afraid of starvation .
Up to the last , they held out

bravely, waiting for the help that never could come,
growing bolder and bolder until their provisions were ex

h austed .
Then it w a s terrible .
In time hundreds of fam

ish ed creatures fell dead in the streets ; and the living
had scarcely strength to bury them .
At last they made

the desperate resolution that , rather than perish by linger

ing torture, the strongest would form in a square, placing

LEYDEN

THE
met at the museum , and were soon engaged

in ex amining its extensive collection of curiosities ,
r e

ceiv ing a new insight into Egyptian life, ancient and
modern .
Ben and Lambert had often visited the British

Museum ;
but that did not prevent them from being

surprised at the richness of the Leyden collection .
There

were household utensils , wearing apparel , weapons, m u

sical instruments , sarcophagi , and mummies of men ,
women and cats , ibexes and other creatures .
They saw

a massive gold armlet that had been worn by an Egyptian
king at a time when some of these same mummies , per
haps , were nimbly treading the streets of Thebes ;
and

jewels and trinkets such as Pharaoh

’s daughter wore,

and the children of Israel borrowed when they departed
out of Egypt .

There were other interesting relics from Rome and

Greece and some curious

: Roman pottery, which had

been discovered in digging near the Hague,

— relics of

I O7

198
HANS
BRINKER

the days when the countrymen of Julius
Caesa r had

settled there .
Where did they not settle ?
I , for one,

would hardly be astonished if relics of the ancient Romans
should some day be found deep under the mass growing
round the Bunker Hill Monument .

When the boys left this museum , they went to another,

and saw a wonderful collection of fossil animals , skeletons,
birds , minerals , precious stones and other natural speci
mens ;
but, as they were not learned men , they could

only walk about and stare, enjoy the little knowledge
of natural history they possessed , and wish with all their
hearts they had acquired more .
Even the skeleton of

the mouse puzzled Jacob .
What wonder !
He w a s not

used to seeing the cat-fearing little creatures running
about in their bones ; and h ow could he ever have imagined
their necks to be so queer ?

Besides the Museum of Natural History, there was

St . Peter

’s Church to be visited , containing Professor

Luz ac

’

s Memorial, and Boerhaave

’s Monument of white

and black marble, with its urn and carved symbols of
the four ages of life, and its medallion of Boerhaave,
adorned with his favorite motto,

“ Simplex
sigillum veri .

”

They also obtained admittance to a tea-garden, which
in summer was a favorite resort of the citizens, and ,
passing naked
oaks
and
fruit-trees , ascended
a high

mound which stood in the centre .
This was the site of

a round tower, now in ruins , said by some to have been
built by Hengist, the Anglo-Saxon king, and by others

200
HANS BRINKER

saw a crowd of boys on the edge of the wall opposite ;
but Jacob w as not there .

“ Good Heavens I

” he cried , springing forward ,
where

is my cousin ?

”

The crowd parted .
It w a s only four boys , after all .

There sat Jacob in their midst, holding his fat sides, and
laughing heartily .

“ Did I frighten you all ?

” he said in his native Dutch .

Well, I will tell you how it w a s .
There was a big stone

lying on the wall, and I put my foot out , just to push it
a little, you see ; and , the ﬁrst thing I knew, down went
the stone all the w ay to the bottom, and left me sitting
here on top with both my feet in the air .
If I had not

thrown myself back at that moment , I certainly should
have rolled over after the stone .
Well, it is no matter .

Help me up , boys .

”

“ You are hurt , Jacob ,
said Ben , seeing a shade of

seriousness pass over his cousin

’s face as they lifted him

to his feet .

Jacob tried to laugh again .
Oh , no !
I feels little

hurt
v en I stant up ; but it ish no matter .

The monument to Van der Werf in the Hooglandsch e

Kerk was not accessible that day ;
but the boys spent

a few pleasant moments in the St adh uis, or Town Hall,
a long, irregular structure somewhat in the Gothic style,
uncouth in architecture, but picturesque from age .
Its

little steeple, tuneful with bells , seemed to have been

LEYDEN
20 1

borrowed from some other building, and hastily clapped
on as a ﬁnishing touch .

Ascending the grand staircase, the boys soon found

themselves in a rather gloomy apartment, containing
the masterpiece of Lucas van Leyden , or Hugens, a
Dutch artist, born nearly four hundred years
ago,

’
wh o

painted quite Cleverly when he was ten years of age, and
became distinguished in art when only ﬁfteen .
This

picture, called the
Last Judgment ,

” considering the

remote age in which it was painted , is truly a remarkable
production .
The boys, however, were less interested

in tracing out the merits of the work than they were in
the fact of its being a triptych ; that is , painted on three
divisions ,

-the two outer ones swung on hinges so as to

close, when required , over the main portion .

The historical pictures by Harel de Moor, and other

famous Dutch artists , interested them for a while ; and
Ben had to be almost pulled away from the dingy old
portrait of Van der Werf.

The Town Hall, as well as the Egyptian Museum , is

on the B r eed str a at, the longest and ﬁnest street in Ley
den .
It has no canal running through it ; and the houses ,

painted in every variety of color, have a picturesque
effect as they stand with their gable-ends to the street .
Some are very tall, with half of their height in their step
like roofs ;
others crouch before the public ediﬁces and

churches .
Being clean , spacious , well-shaded , and adorned

with many elegant mansions , it compares favorably with

202
HANS
BRINKER

the ﬁner portions of Amsterdam .
It is kept scrupulously

neat .
Many of the gutters are covered with boards that

open like trap-doors ; and it is supplied with p umps sur
mounted with shining brass ornaments , kept scoured
and bright at the public cost .
The city is intersected

by numerous water-roads formed by the river Rhine,
there grown sluggish , fatigued by its long travel ;
but

more than one hundred and ﬁfty stone bridges reunite
the dissevered streets .
The same world-renowned river,

degraded from the beautiful, free-ﬂowing Rhine, serves
as a moat around the rampart that surrounds Leyden ,
and is crossed by drawbridges at the imposing gateways
that give access to the city .
Fine broad promenades ,

shaded by noble trees , border the canals , and add to the
retired appearance of the houses behind , heightening the
eff ect of scholastic seclusion that seems to pervade the
place .

Ben , as he scanned the buildings on the Rapenburg

Canal,
w a s somewhat disappointed in the appearance

of the great University of Leyden .
B utwhen he recalled

its history

—
how, attended with -all the pomp of a grand

Civic display, it had been founded by the P rince of Orange
as a tribute to the citizens for the bravery displayed
during the siege ;
when he remembered the great men

in religion , learning and science, who had once studied
there ;
and thought of the hundreds of students now

sharing the beneﬁts of its classes , and its valuable
scien

tiﬁc museums

—
h e
w a s quite willing to forego archi

brandt

’s home a mile
off , and tiﬂin close by .
Ben chose

the latter .

After
tiﬁ n, they rested a while, and then

— took
an

other, which , for form

’s sake, they called dinner .
After

dinner the boys sat warming themselves at the inn ,
all but Peter, who occupied the time in another fruitless
search for Dr . Bockman .

This over, the party once more p r ep as

ed for skating .

They were thirteen miles from the Hague, and not as
fresh as when they had left Broek early on the previous
day .
But they were in good spirits, and the ice w as

excellent .

XXVI

THE PALACE AND THE WOOD

As the boys skated onward , they saw a number of

ﬁne
country-seats ,
all
decorated
and
surrounded
ac

cording to the
Dutch est of Dutch taste, but impres

sive to look upon , with their great formal houses , elaborate
gardens , square hedges and wide ditches ,

—some crossed

by a bridge, having a gate in the middle to be carefully
locked at night .
These ditches , everywhere traversing

the landscape, had long ago lost their summer ﬁlm , and
now shone under the sunlight like trailing ribbons of glass .

The boys travelled bravely, all the while performing

the surprising feat of producing gingerbread from their
pockets , and causing it to vanish instantly .

Twelve miles were passed .
A few more strokes would

take them to the Hague, when Van M oun en proposed
that they should vary their course by walking into the
city through the Bosch .

“ Agreed !

” cried one and all ;
and their skates were

off in a twinkling .

206
HANS
BRINKER

The Bosch is a grand park, or wood , nearly two miles

long, containing the celebrated House in the Wood ,
Huis i n

’
t B osch,

—
sometimes used as a royal residence .

This building, though plain outside for a palace, is

elegantly furnished within, and ﬁnely frescoed ; that is,
the walls and ceiling are covered with groups and designs
painted directly upon them while the plaster w as fresh .
Some of the rooms are tapestried with Chinese silk,
beautifully embroidered .
One contains
a
number of

family portraits , among them a group of royal children ,

who in time were orphaned by a certain axe which ﬁgures
very frequently in European history .
These children

were painted many times by the Dutch artist Van Dyck,

wh o w as court-painter to their father, Charles the First
of England .
Beautiful children they were .
What a deal

of trouble the English nation would have been spared ,
had they been as perfect in heart and soul as they were
in form !

The park surrounding the palace is charming, espe

cially in summer ; for ﬂowers and birds make it bright as
fairyland .
Long rows of magniﬁcent oaks rear their

proud heads, conscious that no profaning hand will ever
bring them low .
In fact , the Wood has for ages been

held as an almost sacred spot .
Children a re never allowed

to meddle with its smallest twig : the axe of the woodman
has never resounded there .
Even war and riot have

passed it reverently, pausing for a moment in their dev

a st ating w ay

.

HANS BRINKER

Peter drew a vivid picture of its summer charms, and

made the boys smile as he glowingly described the noble
ladies and pretty girls in holiday array, whom he had met
in his afternoon walks to the delightful park .

Never had the sunset appeared more beautiful to Peter

than when he saw it exchanging farewell glances with
the windows and shining roofs of the city before him .
Never had the Hague itself seemed more inviting .
He

w a s no longer Peter v an Holp , going to Visit a great city,
nor a ﬁne young gentleman bent on sight-seeing : he w a s
a knight , an adventurer travel-soiled and weary, a Hop

o

’-my

-thumb grown large, a Fortunatus approaching the

enchanted castle where luxury and ease awaited him ;
for his own sister

’s house was not half a mile away .

“ At last, boys ,

” he cried in high glee,

“ we may hope

for a royal resting-place,

— good beds , warm rooms, and

something to eat .
Our lodgings at the Red Lion have

made us appreciate our own homes .

XXVII

THE MERCHANT PRINCE AND THE PRINCESS

WELL might Peter feel that his sister

’s house was like

an enchanted castle .
Large and elegant as it
wa s, a

spell of quiet hung over it .
The very lion crouching at

its gate seemed to have been turned into stone through
magic .
Within , it was guarded by genii , in the Shape

of red-faced servants , wh o sprang silently forth at the
summons of hell or knocker .
There w a s a cat, also, who

appeared as knowing as any Puss-in-Boots ; and a brass
gnome in the hall, whose business it w as to stand with
outstretched arms ready to receive sticks and umbrellas .
Safe within the walls bloomed a Garden of Delight,
where the ﬂowers ﬁrmly believed it w as summer, and a
sparkling fountain w as laughing merrily to itself because
Jack Frost could not ﬁnd it .
There was a Sleeping Beauty,

too, just at the time of the boys

’ arrival .
But when

Peter, like a true prince, ﬂew lightly up the stairs , and
kissed her eyelids , the enchantment w a s broken .
The

princess became his own good sister, and the fairy castle

2 16
HANS BRINKER

just one of the ﬁnest , most comfortable houses of the
Hague .

As may well be believed , the boys received the heartiest

of welcomes .
After they had conversed a while with

their lively hostess , one of the genii summoned them to
a grand repast in a red -curtained room , where ﬂoor and
ceiling shone like polished ivory ;
and the mirrors sud

d enly blossomed into rosy-checked boys as far as the
eye could reach .

They had caviare now, and salmagundi, and sausage

and cheese, besides salad and fruit and biscuit and cake .
How the boys could partake of such a medley was a
mystery to Ben ;
for the salad w a s sour, and the cake

was sweet ;
the fruit w a s dainty, and the salmagundi

heavy with onions and ﬁsh .
But, while he w as wonder

ing, he made a hearty meal , and was soon absorbed in
deciding which he really preferred ,

—the coffee, or the

anisette cordial .
It
wa s delightful, too,

-this taking

one

’s food from dishes of frosted silver, and liquor-glasses

from which Titania herself might have sipped .
The

young gentleman afterward wrote to his mother, that,
pretty and choice as things were at home, he had never
known what cut glass , china , and silver services were
until he visited the Hague .

Of course Peter

’s sister soon heard of all the boys

’

adventures ,

— how they had skated over forty miles , and

seen rare sights on the way ;
how they had lost their

purse, and found it again ;
how one of the party had

2 1 2
HANS BRINKER

more exciting,
she said .
But I shall wish each of you

to be the Winner .

”

At this moment her husband , Mynheer van Gend,

came in ;
and the enchantment falling upon the boys

was complete .

The invisible fairies of the household at once clustered

about them, whispering that Jasper
v an
Gend had a

heart as young and fresh as their own ; and , if he loved
anything in this world more than industry, it was sun
shine and frolic .
They hinted , also, something about

his having a heart full of love, and a head full of wisdom,
and ﬁnally gave the boys to understand , that, when myn
heer said a thing, he meant it .

Therefore his frank

“ Well now, this is pleasant ,
as

he shook hands with them all, made the boys feel quite
at home, and as happy as squirrels .

There were ﬁne paintings in the drawing-room , and

exquisite statuary, and portfolios ﬁlled with rare Dutch
engravings , besides many beautiful and curious things
from China and Japan .
The boys felt that it would

require a month to examine all the treasures of the
apartment .

Ben noticed with pleasure English books lying upon

the table .
He
saw, also, over the carved , upright piano ,

life-sized portraits of William of Orange and his English
queen ,

-a sight
that for a time brought England and

Holland side by side in his heart .
William and Mary

have left a halo round the English throne to thi s d ay,

MERCHANT PRINCE AND PRINCESS
2 13

he the truest patriot that ever served an adopted coun
try ;
she the noblest wife that ever sat upon a British

throne up to the time of Victoria , and Albert the Good .
As Ben looked at the pictures, he remembered accounts
he had read of King William

’s visit to the Hague in the

winter of 1691 .
He who sang the

“ Battle of Ivry,

” had

not yet told the glowing story of that day ;
but Ben

knew enough of it to fancy that he could almost hear
the shouts of the delighted populace as he looked from
the portraits to the street, which at this moment w as
aglow with a bonﬁre, kindled in a neighboring square .

That royal visit was one never to be forgotten .
For

two years William of Orange had been monarch of a
foreign land , his head working faithfully for England ,
but his whole heart yearning for Holland .
Now, when

he sought its shores once more, the entire nation bade
him welcome .
Multitudes ﬂocked to the Hague to meet

him .

“ Many thousands came sliding or skating along

the frozen canals from Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Leyden ,
Haarlem , Delft .

” 1
“ All day long the festivities of the

capital were kept up .
The streets Were gorgeous with

banners , evergreen arches , trophies and mottoes of w el
come, and emblems of industry .
William saw the deeds

of his ancestors , and scenes of his own past life, depicted
on banners and tapestries along the streets .
At night ,

superb ﬁreworks were displayed upon the ice .
Its glassy

surface w as like a mirror .
Sparkling fountains of light

1 Macaulay

s History of England .

2 14
HANS BRINKER

sprang up from below to meet the glittering cascades
leaping upon it ;
then a feathery ﬁre of crimson and

green shook millions of rubies and emeralds into the
ruddy depths of the ice :

”
and all this time the people

were shouting,
God bless William of Orange !
Long

live the King !

”
They were half mad with joy and
en

th usiasm .
William , their
own prince, their stadtholder,

had become the ruler of three kingdoms .
He had been

victorious in council and in war, and
now , in his hour of

greatest triumph , had come as a
Simple guest to visit

them .
The king heard their shouts with a beating heart .

It is a great thing to be beloved by one

’s country .
His

English courtiers complimented him upon his reception .

“ Yes ,

” said he ;

“ but the shouting is nothing to what

it would have been if Mary had been with me !

While Ben was looking at the portraits, Mynheer
v an

Gend was giving the boys an account of a recent visit
to Antwerp .
As it was the birthplace of Quentin Matsys,

the blacksmith who for love of an artist

’s daughter

studied until he became a great painter, the boys asked
their host if he had seen any of Matsys

’ works .

“ Yes , indeed !

” he replied ;

“ and excellent they are .

His famous triptych in a chapel of the Antwerp Cathedral ,
with the Descent from the Cross on the centre panel ,
is especially ﬁne ; but I confess I w a s more interested in
his Well .

”

“ What well , mynheer
asked Ludwig .

One in the heart of the city, near this same cathedral,

2 16
HANS BRINKER

So, so !
exclaimed the rather crestfallen spouse .

But I
ca n think of the other, Jasper ; and it will add

a deeper value to your gift .
You remember the incident ,

do you not, Peter

— how when the French were inv ad

ing Prussia , and for lack of means the country w as unable
to defend itself against the enemy, the women turned
the scale by pouring their plate and jewels into the public
treasury .

“Aha I

”
thought mynheer, as he met his
vr ouw

’
s kin

dling glance .

“ The proud light is there now, in earnest .

”

Peter remarked mischievously that the women had

still proved true to their vanity on that occasion ;
for

jewelry they would have .
If gold or silver were wanted

by the kingdom, they would relinquish it , and use iron ;
but they could not do without their ornaments .

“ What of that ?

” said the
vr ouw, kindling again .
It

is no sin to love beautiful things, if you adapt your ma

r erial to circumstances .
All I have to say is , the women

saved their country, and , indirectly, introduced a very
important
branch
of manufacture .
Is
not
that
so

,

Jasper ?

”

“ Of course it is, sweetheart ,
said mynheer ;
but

Peter needs no word of mine to convince him , that, all
the world over, women have never been found wanting
in their country

’s hour of trial, though

”
(bowing to

mevr ouw)

“ his
own countrywomen stand foremost in

the records of female patriotism and devotion .

”

Then , turning to Ben , the host talked with him in

MERCHANT PRINCE AND PRINCESS
2 17

English of the ﬁne old Belgian city .
Among other things,

he told the origin of its name .
Ben had been taught that

Antwerp was derived from
a e

’

nt werf (on the Wharf) ;

but Mynheer
v an Gend gave him a far more interesting

derivation .

It appears that
abOIIt three thousand years ago a great

giant , named Antigonus, lived on the river Scheld , on
the site of the present city of Antwerp .
This giant

claimed
half the
merchandise of all navigators
who

passed his castle .
Of course
some were
inclined
to

oppose this simple regulation .
In such cases Antigonus ,

by way of teaching them to practise better manners next
time, cut
off , and threw into the river, the right hands of

the merchants .
Thus ha nd-werpen (or hand-throwing) ,

changed to Antwerp , came to be the name of the place .
The escutcheon , or arms , of the city has tw o hands upon
it : what better proof than this could one have of the
truth of the story, especially when one wishes to be
lieve it ?

The giant w as finally conquered , and thrown into the

Scheld by a hero called Brabo , wh o, in turn , gave a name
to the district known as Brabant .
Since then the Dutch

merchants have travelled the river in peace ; but I , for
one , thank old Antigonus for giving the city so romantic

a n origin .

When Mynheer van Gend h ad related in two languages

this story of Antwerp , he
w as tempted to tell other

legends, some in English , some in Dutch ;
and so
the

2 18
HANS BRINKER

moments , borne upon the swift shoulders of gnomes
and giants , glided rapidly away toward bedtime .

It wa s hard to break up so pleasant a party ; but the

Van Gend household moved with the regularity of clock
work .
There w as no lingering at the threshold when the

cordial

“ Good-night !

”
w as spoken .
Even while our

boys were mounting the stairs , the invisible household
fairies
again
clustered
around them , whispering that

system and regularity had been chief builders of the
master

’s prosperity .

Beautiful chambers with three beds in them were not

to be found in this mansion .
Some of the rooms
con

t ained two ; but each visitor slept alone .
Before morning

the motto of the party evidently was,

“ Every boy his

own chrysalis ;

”
and Peter, at least , was not sorry to

have it so .

Tired as he w as, Ben , after noting a curious bell-rope

in the corner, began to examine his bed-clothes .
Each

article ﬁlled
him with
astonishment,

-the exquisitely

ﬁne pillow—spread trimmed with costly lace, and em
broidered with a gorgeous crest and initial ;
the dekbed

cover (a great silk bag, large as the bed , stuffed with
swan

’s down) ;
and the pink satin quilts, embroidered

with garlands of ﬂowers .
He could scarcely sleep for

thinking What a queer little bed it w a s; so comfortable
and pretty, too, with all its queerness .
In the morning

he examined the top coverlet with care ;
for he Wished

to send home a description of it in his next letter .
It

was a Japanese spread , marvellous in texture, as well as

2 20
HANS BRINKER

be thorough , in even the smallest beginnings, that earned
for him the title of Peter the Great .

Peter the little (comparatively speaking) was up ﬁrst

the next morning .
Knowing the punctual habits of his

brother-in-law, he took good care that none of the boys
should oversleep themselves .
A hard task he found it

to wake Jacob Poot ; but after pulling that young gentle
man out of bed , and , with Ben

’s help , dragging him about

the room for a while, he succeeded in arousing him .

While Jacob
w as dressing,
a nd moaning within him

because the felt slippers provided him as a guest were
too tight for his swollen feet , Peter wrote to inform their
friends at Broek of the safe arrival of his party at the
Hague .
He also begged his mother to send word to Hans

Brinker that Dr . Bockman had not yet reached Leyden ,
but that a letter containing Hans

’ message had been

left at the hotel where the d octor always lodged during
his visits to the city .
Tell him, also,

” wrote Peter,

that I shall call there again as I pass through Leyden .

The poor boy seemed to feel sure that the meester would
hasten to save his father ; but we, who know the gruff

Old gentleman better, may be conﬁdent he will do no
such thing .
It would be a kindness to send a visiting

physician from Amsterdam to the cottage at once, if

Jufv r ouw 1 Brinker will consent to receive any but the
great king of the meester s, as Dr . Boekm an certainly is .

1 In Holland , women of the lower grades of society do
not take the title
of

M r s. (or mevr ouw) when they mar ry, as with u s.
They assume their hu sband

’

s

name, but are still called Mi ss (j ufvr ouw, pronounced yuﬂr ow) .

MERCHANT PRINCE AND PRINCESS
2 2 1

You know, mother,

”
added
Peter,

“ that I have

always considered Sister Van
Gend

’

s house as rather

quiet and lonely ;
but I assure you it is not so now .

Sister says Our presence has warmed it for the whole
winter .
Brother Van Cend is very kind to us all .
He

says w e make him wish that he had a houseful of boys
of his
own .
He has promised to let us ride on his noble

black horses .
They are gentle as kittens, he says , if

one have but a ﬁrm touch at the rein .
Ben , according

to Jacob

’s account , is a glorious rider ;
and your son

Peter is not a very bad hand at the business : so we two
are to go out together this morning, mounted like knights
of old .
After w e return , Brother Van Cend says he will

lend Jacob his English pony, and obtain three extra
horses ;
and all of the party are to trot about the city

in a grand cavalcade, led on by him .
He will ride the

black horse which father sent him from Friesland .
My

sister

’s pretty roan , with the long White tail, is lame ;

and she will ride none other, else she would accompany
us .
I could scarce close my eyes last night, after sister

told me of the plan .
Only the thought of poor Hans

Brinker and his sick father checked me :
but for that , I

could have sung for joy .
Ludwig has given us a name

already,

— the Black Cavalry .
We ﬂatter ourselves that

we shall make an imposing appearance, especially in
single ﬁle .

”

The Black Cavalry were not disappointed .
Mynheer

van Gend readily procured good horses ; and all the boys

2 22
HANS BRINKER

could ride, though none were as perfect horsemen (or

h or seboys) as Peter and Ben .
They saw the Hague to

their hearts

’ content ; and the Hague saw them, expres

sing its approbation loudly, through the mouths of small
boys and cart-dogs ; silently, through bright eyes , that,
not looking very deeply into things , shone as they looked
at the handsome Carl, and twinkled with fun as a cer
tain portly youth with shaking cheeks rode past,

“ bum

petty, b ump etty, bump I

”

On their return , the boys pronounced the great p or ce

lain stove in the family sitting-room a decidedly useful
piece of furniture ;
for they could gather round it, and

get warm, without burning their noses, or bringing on
chilblains .
It was so very large, that , though hot no

where, it seemed to send out warmth by the houseful .
Its pure white sides and polished brass rings made it a
pretty object to look upon , notwithstanding the fact
that our ungrateful Ben , while growing thoroughly warm
and comfortable beside it, concocted a satirical sentence
for his next letter, to the effect that a stove in Holland
must , of course, resemble a great tower of snow, or it
wouldn

’t be in keeping with the oddity of the country .

To describe all the boys saw and did on that day and

the next would render this little book a formidable volume
indeed .
They Visited the brass-cannon foundry, saw the

liquid ﬁre poured into moulds, and watched the smiths,

wh o, half naked , stood in the shadow, like demons play
ing with ﬂame .
They admired the grand public build

2 24
HANS BRINKER

a glorious anthem because Leyden
w a s free .
He
r e

membered that this was even before they had tasted
the bread brought by the Dutch ships .
They would

praise God
ﬁrst , then
eat .
Thousands of trembling

voices were raised in glad thanksgiving .
For a moment

it swelled higher and higher, then suddenly changed to
sobbing : not one of all the multitude could sing another
note .
But wh o shall say that the anthem , even to its

very end , was not heard in heaven ?

Here, in the Hague, other thoughts came to Ben ,

of how Holland , in later years , unwillingly put her head
under the French yoke, and how, galled and lashed past
endurance, she had resolutely jerked it out again .
He

liked her for that .
What nation of any spirit , thought

he, could be expected to stand such work ,

— paying all

her wealth into a foreign treasury, and yielding up the
ﬂower of her youth under foreign conscription ?
It w as

not so very long ago, either, since English guns had been
heard booming close by in the German Ocean .
Well,

all the ﬁghting w a s over at last !
Holland was a snug

little monarchy now, in her own right ; and Ben , for one,
was glad of it .
Arrived at this charitable conclusion , he

was prepared to enjoy to the utmost all the wonders of
her capital .
He quite delighted Mynheer
v an
Gend

with his hearty and intelligent interest : so, in fact, did
all the boys ; for a merrier, more observant party never
went sight-seeing .

THROUGH THE HAGUE

THE picture-gallery in the Maurits Huis ,

1 one of the

ﬁnest in the World , seemed only to have ﬂashed by the
boys during a two hours

’ Visit, so much was there to

admire and examine .
As for the royal cabinet of curiosi

ties, in the same building, they felt that they had but
glanced at it , though they were there nearly half a day .
It seemed to them that Japan had poured all her treasures
within its walls .
For a long period Holland , always fore

most in commerce, was the only nation allowed to have
any intercourse with Japan .
One
can well forego a

journey to that country, if one can but visit the museum
at the Hague .

Room after room is ﬁlled with collections from the

Hermit
Empire,

— costumes
peculiar to various
ranks

and pursuits, articles of ornament, household utensils,
weapons , armor and surgical instruments .
There is also

an ingenious Japanese model of the Island of Desina ,

1A building erected by P rince Mau rice of Nassau.

2 25

2 26
HANS
BRINKER

the Dutch factory in Japan .
It
ap p ear s

o almost as the

island itself would if seen through a reversed opera-glass,
and makes one feel like a Gulliver coming unexpectedly
upon a Japanese Lilliput .
There you see hundreds of

people in native costumes , standing, kneeling, stooping,
reaching,

—
all at work, or pretending to b e,

— and their

dwellings , even their very furniture, spread out before
you, plain as day .
In another room a huge tortoise

shell baby-house, ﬁtted up in Dutch style, and inhabited
by digniﬁed Dutch dolls , stands ready to tell you at a
glance how people live in Holland .

Gretel, Hilda, Katrinka , even the proud Rychie Korbes ,

would have been delighted with this ; but Peter and his
gallant band passed it by without a glance .
The war

implements had the honor of detaining them for an hour ;
such clubs , such murderous krisses , or daggers , such ﬁ r e
arms , and , above all, such wonderful Japanese swords ,
quite capable of performing the accredited Japanese feat
of cutting a man in two at a single stroke !

There were Chinese and other Oriental curiosities in

the collection .
Native historical relics , too, upon which

our young Dutchmen gazed very soberly, though they
were secretly proud to show them to Ben .

There w a s a model of the cabin at Zaandam , in which

Peter the Great lived during his short career as a ship
builder ;
also wallets and bowls once carried by the

beggar
Confederates , who, uniting under the Prince

of Orange, had freed Holland from the tyranny of Spain ;

2 28
HANS
BRINKER

gallant to allow the lady to enter the town on foot .
No,

sir !
We sent (or rather my ancestors did) a clean ,
Open

post-wagon to meet her with a plank across it for her to
sit upon .

”

“ Very gallant, indeed !
exclaimed Ben, with almost

a sneer in his polite laugh ,

— “ and she the daughter of

an admiral of France .

”

“ Was she ?
Upon my word , I had nearly forgotten

that .
But , you see, Holland had very plain ways in the

good old time ; in fact, we are a very simple, frugal people
to this day .
The Van Gend establishment is a decided

exception , you know .

”

“ A very agreeable exception , I think,
said Ben .

Certainly, certainly .
But, between you and me,

Mynheer van
Gend, though he has wrought his
own

fortunes , can afford to be magniﬁcent , and yet be frugal .

”

“ Exactly so,

” said Ben , profoundly, at the same time

stroking his upper lip and chin , which latterly, he b e

liev ed , had been showing delightful and unmistakable
signs of coming dignities .

While tramping on foot through the city, Ben often

longed for a good English sidewalk .
Here, as in the other

towns , there w a s no curb , no raised pavement for foot
travellers ; but the streets were clean and even, and all
vehicles were kept scrupulously within a certain tract .
Strange to say, there were nearly as many sleds as wagons
to be seen , though there
w a s not a particle of snow .

The sleds Went scraping over the bricks or cobble-Stones ;

THROUGH THE HAGUE
2 29

some provided with an apparatus in front for sprinkling
water, to diminish the friction , and some rendered less
musical by means of a dripping oil rag, which the driver

'

occasionally applied to the runners .

Ben was surprised at the noiseless way in which Dutch

laborers do their work .
Even around the warehouses

and docks , there was no bustle, no shouting from one
to another .
A certain twitch of the pipe, or turn of the

head , or at most a raising of the hand , seemed to be all
the signal necessary .
Entire loads of cheeses or herrings

are pitched from cart or canal-boat into the warehouses
without a word : but the passer-by must take his chance
of being pelted ; for a Dutchman seldom looks before or
behind him while engaged at work .

Poor Jacob Poot, who seemed destined to bear all the

mishaps of the journey, w as knocked nearly breathless
by a great cheese which a fat Dutchman was throwing
to a fellow-laborer ; but he recovered himself, and passed
on without evincing the least indignation .

Ben professed great sympathy on the occasion ;
but

Jacob insisted that it w as

“ notting .

”

“Then why did you screw your face so when it hit

you ?

”

“ What for screw mine face ?

” repeated Jacob , soberly .

Vy, it vash de

— de

“ The what ?

” insistizd Ben, maliciously .

Vy, de—
d e

b
v at you call dis vat you taste mit de

nose ?

”

230
HANS BRINKER

Ben laughed .

“ Oh ! you mean the smell .

Yesh .
Dat ish it ,

” said Jacob , eagerly .
It wash

de
shmell .
I draw mine face for dat .

”

“ Ha, ha I

” roared Ben ,

“ that

’s a good one .
A Dutch

boy smell a cheese !
You can never make me believe

that.

”

“ Vell, it ish no matter,
replied Jacob , trudging on

beside Ben in perfect good-humor :

“ vair till you hit

mit cheese, dat ish all .

Soon he added pathetically,
Pench amin, I no likes

be call Tutch : dat ish no goot .
I bees a Hollander .

”

Just as Ben w as apologizing, Lambert hailed him .

Hold up , Ben .
Here is the ﬁsh-market .
There is

not much to be seen at this season .
But we
can take a

look at the storks , if you wish .

”

Ben knew that storks were held in peculiar reverence

in Holland , and that the bird ﬁgured upon the arms of
the capital .
He had noticed cart-wheels placed upon

the roofs of Dutch cottages to entice storks to settle
upon them : he had seen their huge nests , too, on many a
thatched gable-roof from Broek to the Hague .
But it

was winter now .
The nests were empty .
No greedy

birdlings opened their mouths, or rather their heads, at
the approach of a great white winged thing, with out
stretched neck and legs , bearing a dangling something
for their breakfast .
The long-bills were far away, pick

ing up food on African shores ;
and , before they. would

232
HANS
BRINKER

The shops were different in many respects from those
on Oxford Street and the Strand ;
but they often were

illumined by a printed announcement that English was

“ spoken
within .

”
Others
proclaimed
themselves
to

have London Stout for sale, and one actually claimed to
be able to regale its customers with English roast beef.

Over every possible shop-door
w as the never-failing

placard , Tabak de K oop (

“ tobacco to be
Instead

of colored glass globes in the windows, or high jars of
leeches , the drug stores had a gaping Turk

’s head
at

the entrance ; or, if the establishment were particularly
ﬁne, a wooden mandarin entire, indulging in a full yawn .

Some of these queer faces amused Ben exceedingly

they seemed to have just swallowed a dose of physic ;
but Van M ounen declared he could not see anything
funny about them .
A druggist showed his sense by

putting a Gaper before his door, so that his place could
be known at once as an
ap otheek; and that w as all there

w as about it .

Another thing attracted Ben,

— the
milkmen

’

s carts .

These were small affairs, ﬁlled with shiny brass kettles ,
or stone jars , and drawn by dogs .
The milkman walked

meekly beside his cart , keeping his dog in order, and
delivering the milk to customers .
Certain
ﬁsh-dealers

had dog-carts also ;
and , when a herring-dog chanced

to meet a milk-dog, he invariably put on airs and growled
as he passed him .
Even the dogs of the hucks ter-women ,

lean and hard-worked enough , poor things, had sufficient

THROUGH THE HAGUE
233

spirit to champ and snarl while their mistresses were
squabbling .
Sometimes a milk-dog would recognize an

acquaintance before another milk-cart across the street ;
and then how the kettles would rattle, especially if they
were empty !
Each dog would give a bound , and , never

caring for his master

’s whistle, insist upon meeting the

other half way

.
Sometimes they contented themselves

with an inquisitive sniff; but generally the smaller dog
made an affectionate snap at the larger one

’s ear, or a

friendly tussle w a s engaged in by w ay of exercise .
Then

woe to the milk-kettles, and woe to the dogs !

The whipping over, each dog, expressing his feelings

as best he could , would trot demurely back to his work .

If some of these animals were eccentric in their ways,

others were remarkably well behaved .
In fact , there

w as a school for dogs in the city, established expressly
for training them :
Ben probably saw some of its grad

u ates .
Many a time he noticed a span of barkers trot

ting along the street , with all the dignity of horses,
obeying the slightest hint of the man walking briskly
beside them .
Sometimes , when their load w a s delivered ,

the dealer would jump in the cart, and have a ﬁne drive
to his home beyond the gates of the City ; and sometimes,
I regret to say , a patient
vr ouw would trudge beside the

cart , with ﬁsh-basket upon her head , and a child in her

arms , While her lord enjoyed his drive, carrying no heavier
burden than a
Stumpy clay pipe, the smoke of which

mounted shyly into her face .

XXIX

A DAY OF REST

THE sight-seeing came to an end at last ;
and so did

our boys

’ visit to the Hague .
They had spent three

happy days and nights with the Van Gend s, and , strange
to say, had not once, in all that time, put on skates .
The third day had indeed been one of rest .
The noise

and bustle of the city w a s hushed :
sweet Sunday bells

sent blessed , tranquil thoughts into their hearts .
Ben

felt , as he listened to their familiar music, that the Chris
tian world is one, after all, however divided by sects and
differences it may be .
As the clock speaks every one

’s

native language, in whatever land it may strike the hour,
so church-bells are never foreign, if our hearts but listen .

Led on by those clear voices, our party, with Me

vrouw
v an Gend and her husband , trod the quiet but

crowded streets , until they came to a ﬁne old church in
the southern part of the city .

The interior w as large , and , notwithstanding its great

stained windows , seemed dimly lighted , though the walls

236
HANS
BRINKER

He could not but think of the solemn funeral p r oces

sion, winding by torchlight through those lofty aisles ,
and bearing its silent burden toward a dark
Opening

whence a slab had been lifted , in readiness for its coming .
It w as something to feel that his sister Mabel, wh o died
in her ﬂower, w as lying in a sunny churchyard , where
a brook rippled and sparkled in the daylight , and waving
trees whispered together all night long ;
where ﬂowers

might nestle close to the headstone, and moon and stars
shed their peace upon it, and morning birds sing sweetly
overhead .

Then he looked up from the pavement , and rested

his eyes upon the carved oaken pulpit , exquisitely beau
tiful in design and workmanship .
He could not see

the minister,

— though , not long before, he had watched

him slowly ascending its winding stair,

—
a mild-faced

man , wearing a ruff about his neck, and a short cloak
reaching nearly to the knee .

Meantime, the great church had been silently ﬁlling .

Its pews were sombre with men,
and its centre radiant

with women in their fresh Sunday attire .
Suddenly a soft

rustling spread through the building .
All eyes were turned

toward the minister now appearing above the pulpit .

Although the sermon
w as spoken slowly, Ben could

understand little of what w a s said ; but, when the hymn
came, he joined in with all his heart .
A thousand voices

lifted in love and praise offered a grander language, that
he could readily comprehend .

A
DAY
OF REST
237

Once he w a s startled , during a pause in the service,

by seeing a little bag suddenly shaken before him .
It

had
a

‘ tinkling bell at its side, and
w as attached to a

long stick carried by one of the deacons of the church .
Not relying solely upon the mute appeal of the poor
boxes , fastened to the column near the entrance, this
more direct method
w as resorted to, of awaking the

sympathies of the charitable .

Fortunately Ben had provided himself with a few

stivers, or the musical bag must have tinkled before
him in vain .

More than once a dark look rose on our English boy

’s

face that morning .
He longed to stand up , and harangue

the people concerning a peculiarity that ﬁlled him with
pain .
Some of the men wore their hats during the service,

or took them
off whenever the humor prompted ;
and

many put theirs on in the church as soon
as they

arose to leave .
No wonder Ben

’s sense of propriety was

wounded ;
and yet a higher sense would have been

exercised , had he tried to feel willing that Hollanders
should follow the customs of their country .
But his

English heart said ov er and over again,

“ It is outrageous I

it is
Sinful !

There is an angel called Charity,
who often would

save our hearts a great deal of trouble, if we would but
let her in .

XXX

HOMEWARD BOUND

ON Monday morning, bright and early, our boys bade

farewell to their kind entertainers, and started on their
homeward journey .

Peter lingered a While at the lion-guarded door ;
for

he and his sister had many parting words to say .

As Ben saw them bidding each other
good-by,
he

could not help feeling that kisses, as well as clocks , were
wonderfully alike everywhere .
The English kiss that

his sister Jenny gave when he left home had said the
same thing to him that the
vr ouw Van Gend

’

s Dutch

kiss said to Peter .
Ludwig had taken his share of the

farewell in
the
most
matter-of-fact
manner possible,

and , though he loved his sister well, had winced a little
at her making such a child of him as to put an extra
kiss

“ for mother

” upon his forehead .

He was already upon the canal with Car! and Jacob .

Were they thinking about sisters or kisses ?
Not a

bit of it .
They were so happy to be on skates once

more, so impatient to dart at once into the very heart

240
HANS BRINKER

Hold up !
This only
Served to send them onward

with a two-boy power that startled all beholders .

But the laws of inertia are stronger even than canal

guards .

After
a while, Jacob slackened his speed , then Lud

wig, then Lambert , then Carl .

They soon halted to take a long breath , and , ﬁnally,

found themselves standing in a group , gazing after Peter
and Ben , wh o were still racing in the distance as if their
lives were at stake .

“ It is very evident,
said Lambert , as he and his

three companions started on
again ,

“ that neither of them

will give up if he
can help it .

”

What foolishness I

” growled Carl,
to tire them

selves
at the beginning of the journey .
But they

’re
r ac

ing in earnest, that

’s
certain .
Halloo I Peter

’s
ﬂag

ging !

”

“ Not so I

” cried Ludwig .
Catch him being beaten !

Ha, ha !

” sneered Carl .
I tell you, boy, Benj amin

is ahead .

”

Now, if Ludwig disliked
anything in this world , it

was to be called a boy— probably because he was nothing
else .
He grew indignant at once

“ Humph I what are you , I wonder ?
There, sir !
now

look and see if Peter isn

’t ahead I

”

“ I think he is,

” interposed Lambert ;
but I can

’t

quite tell at this distance .

”

“ I think he isn

’t I

” retorted Carl .

HOMEWARD BOUND
241

Jacob was growing anxious .
He always abhorred an

argument ;

. so he said coaxingly,

“ Don

’t quarrel, don

’t

quarrel I

”

“ Don

’t quarrel !
mocked Carl, looking back at Jacob

as he skated .
Who

’s quarrelling ?
Poot, you

’re a

goose I

”

“ I can

’t help that,
was Jacob

’s meek reply .
See !

they are nearing the turn of the canal .

”

“ Now we can see I

” cried Ludwig, in great excitement .

Peter will make it ﬁrst, I know .

”

He can

’t ; for Ben is ahead I

” insisted Carl .
Gunst !

That ice-boat will run over him .
No, he is clear ! They

’re

a couple of geese, anyhow .
Hurrah , they are at the turn !

Now who

’s ahead ?

”

“ Peter !

” cried Ludwig, joyfully .

Good for the captain I

” shouted Lambert and Jacob .

And Carl condescended to mutter,

“ It is Peter, after all .
I thought, all the time, that

head fellow w as Ben .

”

This turn in the canal had evidently been their goal ;

for the two races came to a sudden halt after passing it .

Carl said something about being
glad that they had

sense enough to stop and rest ;
and the four boys skated

on in silence to overtake their companions .

All the while, Carl w a s secretly wishing that he had

kept on with Peter and Ben, as he felt sure he could easily
have come out winner .
He w as a very rapid , though by

no means a graceful skater .

242
HANS BRINKER

Ben was looking at Peter with mingled vexation ,
ad

mir ation and
surpri se, as the boys drew near .

They heard him saying in English ,

“ You

’re a perfect bird on the ice, Peter van Holp .

The ﬁrst fellow that ever beat me in a fair race, I
can

tell you !

Peter, who understood the language better than he

could speak it, returned a laughing b ow at Ben

’s
com

pliment, but made no further reply .
Possibly he was

scant of breath at the time .

“ Now, Pench amin, vat you do mit youself
Get so

hot as a ﬁr e-brick : dat ish no goot ,

” w as Jacob

’s plain

tive comment .

“ Nonsense !

”
answered Ben .
This frosty air will

cool me soon enough .
I am not tired .

”

“ You are beaten , though , my boy,
said Lambert,

in English ,

“ and fairly too .
How will it be, I wonder,

on the day of the grand race ?

Ben ﬂushed ; and as he sailed
off, looking back rather

wearily, he gave a proud , deﬁant laugh , as if to say,

“This
w as mere pastime .
I

’m
deter mined to beat

then , come what may .

”

244
HANS BRINKER

Who

’s weak ? Not I , for one .
But the Wind

’s stronger

than
any of us .
I hope you

’ll condescend to admit

that .

“ Ha, ha !
laughed Van Mounen, who could barely

keep his feet .

“ So it is .

”

Just then the weather-vanes telegraphed to each other

by a peculiar twitch , and in an instant the gust came .
It
nearly
threw
the
strong-chested
Carl :
it
almost

strangled Jacob , and quite upset Ludwig .

“This settles the question,
shouted Peter .
Off with

your skates !
We

’ll go into Voorhout .

”

At Voorhout they found a little inn with a big yard .

The yard was well bricked , and , better than all,
w a s

provided with a complete set of skittles :
so our boys

soon turned the detention into a frolic .
The wind was

troublesome, even in that sheltered quarter ;
but they

were on good standing-ground , and did not mind it .

First a hearty dinner, then the game .
With pins as

long as their arms, and balls as big as their heads, plenty
of strength left for rolling, and a clean sweep of sixty
feet for the strokes, no wonder they were happy .

That night Captain Peter and his men slept soundly .

No prowling robber came to disturb them ; and , as they
were distributed in separate rooms, they did not even
have a bolster-battle in the morning .

Such a breakfast as they ate !
The landlord looked

frightened .
When he had asked them where they

“ b e

longed ,

” he made up his mind that the Br ock people

BOYS
AND GIRLS
245

starved their children .
It was a shame,
Such ﬁne

young gentlemen too !

”

Fortunately the wind had tired itself out, and fallen

asleep
In the great sea-cradle beyond the Dunes .
There

were
Signs of snow : otherwise, the weather w as ﬁne .

It was mere child

’s play for the well-rested boys to

skate to Leyden .
Here they halted a while :
for Peter

had an errand at the Golden Eagle .
He left the city

with a lightened heart .
Dr . Bockman had been at the

hotel, read
the note containing Hans

’s message, and

departed for Broek .

I cannot say it was your letter sent him off so soon ,

explained the landlord .

“ Some rich lady in Broek was

taken bad very sudden ; and he was sent for in haste .

”

Peter turned pale .

What w as the name ?

” he asked .

Indeed , it went in one ear, and out of the other, for

all I hindered it .
Plague to people who can

’t see a travel

ler in comfortable lodgings , but they must whisk him

off before one can breathe I

”

“ A lady in Broek, did you say ?

Yes ,
very gr ufﬂy

.
Any other business, young mas

ter ?

”

“ No, mine host, except that I and my comrades here

would like a bite of something, and a drink of hot coffee .

”

“ Ah !
said the landlord , sweetly .

“A bite you shall

have, and coffee too,

-the ﬁnest in Leyden .
Walk up to

the
Stove, my masters .
Now I think again, that was a

246
HANS BRINKER

widow-lady from Rotterdam, I think they said , Visiting
at one Van Stoep el

’

s, if I mistake not .

“Ah !

” said Peter, greatly relieved .
They live in

the white house by the Schlossen Mill .
Now, mynheer,

the coffee, please .

“ What a goose I was I

” thought he, as the party left

the Golden Eagle,

“ to feel so sure it was my mother .

But
Sh e may be somebody

’s mother, poor woman , for

all that .
Who
can she be, I wonder ?

”

There were not many upon the canal that day, b e

tween Leyden and Haarlem .
However, as the boys

neared Amsterdam, they found themselves once more
in the midst of a moving throng .
The big
Ysbr eeker 1

had been at work for the ﬁrst time that season ; but there

was any amount of skating-ground left yet .

“Three cheers for home I

” cried Van Mounen, as they

came in sight of the great Western Dock (Westelij k Dok)

.

“ Hurrah ,
hurrah !

”
shouted
one
and
all .

“ Hurrah ,

hurrah I

”

This trick of cheering w as an importation among our

party .
Lambert van Mounen had brought it from Eng

land .
As they always gave it in English , it w as
con

sider ed quite an exploit, and , when circumstances per

mitted , always enthusiastically performed , to the sore
dismay of their quiet-loving countrymen .

comers .
Indeed , he w as not upon the canal at all .
She

had not been near Broek before, since the Ev e of St .
Nicholas ; for she was staying with her sick grandmother
in Amsterdam, and had been granted a brief resting-spell,
as the grandmother called it , because she had been such
a faithful little nurse night and day .

Annie had devoted her resting-spell to skating with

all her might toward Broek, and back again , in the hope
of meeting her mother, or some of her family, on the
canal ; or, it might be, Gretel Brinker .
Not one of them

had she seen ; and
Sh e must hurry back without even

catching a glimpse of her mother

’s cottage ; for the poor,

helpless grandmother, she knew, w as by this time moan
ing for some one to turn her upon her cot .

Where
can Gretel be ?

” thought Annie, as she ﬂew

over the ice .

“ She can almost always
Steal a few mo

ments from her work at this time of day .
Poor Gretel !

What a dreadful thing it must be to have a dull father !
I should be wofully afraid of him, I know,

and yet so
Strange I

”

Annie had not heard of his illness .
Dame Brinker

and her affairs received but little notice from the people
of the place .

If Gretel had not been known as a goose-girl, she

might have had more friends among the peasantry of
the neighborhood .
AS it w a s, Annie Bouman was the

only one wh o did not feel ashamed to avow herself by
word and deed the companion of Gretel and Hans .

When the neighbors

’ children laughed at her for keep

ing such poor company,
Sh e would
Simply ﬂush when

Hans was ridiculed , or laugh in a careless, disdainful

w ay

.
But to hear little Gretel abused always awakened

her wrath .

p

“ Goose-girl , indeed !
She would say .
I
c an tell you

any of you are ﬁtter for the work than she .
My father

often said , last summer, that it troubled him to see such
a
bright-eyed ,
patient
little
maiden
tending
geese .

Humph !
She would not harm them , as you would ,

Janz oon Kolp ; and she would not tread upon them, as
you might , Kate Wouters .

”

This would be pretty sure to
Start a laugh at the

clumsy, ill-natured Kate

’s expense ;
and Annie would

walk loftily away from the group of young gossips .
Per

haps some memory of Gretel

’s assailants crossed her

mind as
Sh e skated rapidly toward Amsterdam ; for her

eyes sparkled ominously, and she more than once gave
her pretty head a deﬁant toss .
When that mood passed ,

such a bright, rosy, affectionate look illumined her face,
that more than one weary workingman turned to gaze
after her, and to wish that he had a glad , contented lass
like that for a daughter .

There were ﬁve joyous households in Broek that night .
The boys were back safe and sound ; and they found

all well at home .
Even the sick lady at neighbor Van

Stoep el

’

s w as out of danger .

HANS
BRINKER

But the next morning .
Ah , how stupidly school-bells

will ding-dong, ding-dong, when one is tired .

Ludwig was sure he had never listened to anything so

odious .
Even Peter felt pathetic on the occasion .
Carl

said it w as a Shame for a fellow to have to turn out when
his bones were splitting .
And Jacob soberly bade Ben

off with his satchel as if it

weighed a hundred pounds .

HANS
BRINKER

After a while, as Vollenhov en looked at him rather

blankly, the learned man condescended to speak to him
in simpler phrase .

“ It
i s probably like Rip
Donderd u nck

’

s case,
he

explained in a low, mumbling tone .

“ He fell from the

top of Vopp elploot

’

s windmill .
After the accident , the

man w a s stupid , and ﬁnally became idiotic .
In time,

he lay helpless, like yon fellow on the bed ; moaned , too ,
like him, and kept constantly lifting his hand to his head .
My learned friend Von Chopp em performed an opera
tion upon this Dond erd unck, and discovered under the
skull a small dark sac, which pressed upon the brain .
This had been the cause of the trouble .
My friend Von

Chop p em removed it

—
a
Splendid operation !
You see,

according to Celsus
and here the doctor again went

off into Latin .

“ Did the man live ?

” asked the assistant , respectfully .

Dr . Bockman scowled .

“ That is of no consequence .

I believe he died .
But why not ﬁx your mind on the

grand features of the case ?
Consider a moment how

and he plunged into Latin mysteries more deeply than
ever .

“ But , mynheer,
gently persisted the student, who

knew that the doctor would not rise to the surface for
hours, unless pulled at once from his favorite depths ,

mynheer, you have other engagements to-day :
three

legs in Amsterdam, you remember, an eye in Br ock, and
that tumor up the canal .

”

THE CRISIS
253

The tumor
can wait ,
said the doctor,
r eﬂectiv ely

.

That is another beautiful case—
a beautiful case !
The

woman h as not lifted her head from her shoulder for two
months .
Magniﬁcent tumor, sir !

”

The doctor, by this time, w as speaking aloud .
He had

quite forgotten where h e w a s .

Vollenhov en made another attempt .

“ This poor fellow on the bed , mynheer .
Do you

think you
can save him ?

“ Ah , indeed , certainly,
stammered the doctor, sud

d enly perceiving that he had been talking rather
off the

point,

— “ certainly ; that is

—
I hope so .

”

“ If any one in Holland can , mynheer,
murmured the

assistant with honest bluntness ,

“ it is yourself.

”

The doctor looked displeased , growled out a tender

request for the student to talk less, and beckoned Hans
to draw near .

This strange man had a great horror of speaking to

women , especially on surgical matters .

“ One can never

tell,

” he said ,

“ what moment the creatures will scream

or faint .

”
Therefore he explained Raff B rinker

’

s case

to Hans, and told him what he believed should be done
to save the patient .

Hans listened attentively, growing red and pale by

turns, and throwing quick, anxious glances toward the

It may kill the father, did you say, mynheer !
he

exclaimed at last, in a trembling whisper .

254
HANS BRINKER

It may, my boy .
But I have a strong belief that it

will cure, and not kill .
Ah , if boys were not such dunces !

I could lay the whole matter before you ; but it would
be of no use .

Hans looked blank at this compliment .

“ It would be of no use,

” repeated Dr . Boekman, in

dignantly

.

“A great operation is proposed ;
but one

might as well do it with a hatchet .
The only question

asked is,

‘ Will it kill ?

’

“ The question is
everything to us, mynheer,
said

Hans, with tearful dignity .

Dr . Boekm an looked at him in sudden dismay .

“ Ah , exactly so !
Yo u are right , boy :
I am a fool !

Good boy .
One does not wish one

course not .
I am a fool I

”

“ Will he die, mynheer, if this sickness goes on ?

Humph !
This is no new illness .
The same thing

growing worse every instant ,

— pressure on the brain .

Will take him
off soon, like that,
said the doctor, snap

ping his ﬁngers .

“ And the
Operation may save him ,
pursued Hans .

How soon , mynheer,
can we know ?

”

Dr . Bockman grew impatient .

“ In a day — perhaps an hour .
Talk with your mother,

boy, and let her decide .
My time is short .

Hans
approached his
mother .
At ﬁrst, when she

looked up at him , he could not utter a syllable ;
then ,

turning his eyes away, he said in a ﬁrm voice,

256
HANS BRINKER

examining some curious stone ; at the assistant, the man
coughed , and turned away ;
at her mother,

— ah ! little

Gretel, that w a s the best you could do,

—
to kneel beside

her, and twine your warm young arms about her neck ;
to weep , and implore God to listen .

When the mother arose, Dr .
Boekman, with a
Show

of trouble in his eyes, asked
gr ufﬂy,

“ Well, j ufvr ouw,

shall it be done ?

”

“Will it pain him , mynheer
Sh e asked in a trembling

voice .

“ I cannot say .
Probably not .
Shall it be done ?

It may
cur e him , you said , and , mynheer

— did you

tell my boy that

—
perhaps

— perhaps
she could not

ﬁnish .

“ Yes , j ufvr ouw, I said the patient might sink under

the operation ; but w e will hope it may prove otherwise .

”

He looked at his watch .
The assistant moved impatiently

toward the window .

“ Come, j ufvr ouw, time presses .

Yes, or no ?

”

Hans wound his arm about his mother .
It w as not

his usual
w ay

.
He even leaned his head against her

shoulder .

“ The meester awaits an answer,
he whispered .

Dame Brinker had long been the head of her house

in every sense .
Many a time
Sh e had been very stem

with Hans , ruling him with a
Strong hand , and
r ej oic

ing in her motherly discipline :
now she felt so weak,

so helpless .
It w a s something to feel that ﬁrm embrace .

THE CRISIS
257

There was strength even
in the touch of that yellow

hair

She turned to her boy imploringly .

O Hans !
What
Shall I say ?

”

Say what God tells thee, mother,
answered Hans ,

bowing his head .

One quick, questioning prayer to Heaven rose from

the mother

’s heart .
The answer came .

She turned toward Dr . Boekman

It is right , mynheer .
I consent .

Humph I

” grunted the doctor, as if to say,
You

’ve

been long enough about it .

”
Then he conferred a mo

ment with his assistant , who listened with great outward
deference, but was inwardly rejoicing at the grand joke
he would have to tell his fellow-Students .
He had actually

seen a tear in

“ old Boekm an

’

s

” eye .

Meanwhile
Gretel
looked
on
in
trembling
silence ;

but when she saw the doctor open a leathern case, and
take out one sharp , gleaming instrument after another,
she sprang forward .

“O mother ! the poor father meant no wrong .
Are

they going to mu rder him ?

”

“ I do not know, child ! ” screamed Dame Brinker,

looking ﬁercely at Gretel ,
I do not know .

”

“This will not do, j ufvr ouw,

”
said
Dr .
Boekman,

sternly, and at the same time he cast a quick, penetrating
look at Hans .
You and the girl must leave the room .

The boy may stay .

”

Dame Brinker drew herself up in an instant .
Her

eyes
ﬂashed .
Her whole
countenance
w as
changed .

She looked like one who had never wept, never felt a
moment

’s weakness .
Her voice w a s low, but decided .

“ I stay with my husband , mynheer .

”

Dr .
Bockman looked
astonished .
His orders were

seldom disregarded in this style .
For an instant his

eye met hers .

“You ma

voice .

Gretel had already disappeared .
In one corner of the cottage w a s a small closet , where

her rough , box-like bed w as fastened against the wall .
None would think of

ing there in the dark .

Dr .
Boekman took
off his heavy coat .
He ﬁlled an

earthen basin with water, and placed it near the bed .
Then , turning to Hans, he asked ,

You can , mynheer .

GRETEL AND HILDA

IT was recess-hour .
At the ﬁrst stroke of the school

house-bell the canal seemed to give a tremendous shout,
and grow suddenly alive with boys and girls .
The sly

thing,
Shining so quietly under the noonday sun , w a s a

kaleidoscope at heart , and only needed a shake from that
great clapper to Start it into dazzling changes .

Dozens of gayly-clad children were
Skating in and out

among each other ;
and all their pent-up merriment of

the morning was relieving itself in song and shout and
laugh ter .
There was nothing to check the ﬂow of frolic .

Not a thought of school-books came out with them
into the sunshine .
Latin , arithmetic, grammar, all were

locked up for an hour in the dingy schoolroom .
The

teacher might be a noun, if he wished , and a proper one
at that ; but
they meant to enjoy themselves .
As long

as the Skating w a s as perfect as this , it made no difference
whether Holland were on the north pole or the equator .
And , as for philosophy, how could they bother them

GRETEL AND
HILDA
26 1

selves about inertia and gravitation and such things ,
when it was as much as they could do to keep from

' get

ting knocked over in the commotion ?

In
the height of
the fun , one of the children called

out ,

“ What is that ?

What ?
Where ?

” cried a dozen voices .

Why

— don

’t you see ?
That dark thing over there

by the idiot

’s cottage .

”

“ I

, don

’t see anything,
said one .

I do,

” shouted another .

“ It

’s a dog !

Where

’s any dog ?

” put in a squeaky voice that we

have heard before .

“ It

’s no such thing : it

’s a heap of

rags .

“ Pooh , Voost !

” retorted another,
gr ufﬂy

.
That

’s

about as near the fact as you ever get .
It

’s the goose

girl, Gretel, looking for rats .

”

“ Well, what of it ?

” squeaked Voost .
Isn

’t
she a

bundle of rags , I

’d like to know ?

”

“ Ha , ha !
Pretty good for you, Voost !
You

’ll get a

medal for wit yet , if you keep on .

”

“ You

’d get something else, if her brother Hans were

here .
I

’ll warrant you would I

” said a m ufﬂed-up little

fellow, with a cold in his head .

As Hans was
not there, Voost could afford to scout

the insinuation .

Who cares for him , little sneezer ?
I

’d ﬁght a dozen

like him , any day, and you in the bargain .

262
HANS
BRINKER

You would Iwould you ?
I

’d like to catch you at it .

And , by way of proving his words , the sneezer skated

off at the top of his speed .

Just then a general chase after three of the biggest boys

of the school w as proposed ; and friend and foe, frolic
some as ever, were soon united in a common cause .

Only one of all that happy throng remembered the

dark little form by the idiot

’s cottage .
Poor frightened

Gretel !
She was not thinking of them , though their

merry laughter ﬂoated lightly toward her, making her
feel like one in a dream .

How loud the moans were behind the darkened win

dow !
What if those strange men were really killing

her father !

The thought made her spring to her feet with a cry of

horror .

Ah , no I

” she sobbed , sinking upon the frozen mound

of earth where she had been sitting,

“ mother is there,

and Hans .
They will care for him .
But how pale they

were !
And even Hans w a s crying .

“ Why did the cross old meester keep him, and send me

away
she thought ;

“ I could have clung to the mother,

and kissed her .
That always makes her stroke my hair,

and speak gently, even after she has scolded me .
How

quiet it is
now !
Oh , if the father should die, and Hans,

and the mother ! what would I do ?

”
And Gretel,
Shiver

ing with cold , buried her face in her arms , and cried as if
her heart would break .

GRETEL AND
HILDA
263

The poor child had been tasked beyond her strength

during the past four days .
Through all, she had been her

mother

’
s willing little handmaiden , soothing, helping and

cheering the half-widowed woman by day, and watching
and praying beside her all the long night .
She knew

that something terribleand mysterious was taking place
at this moment ,

—
something that had been too terrible

and mysterious for even kind , good Hans to tell .

Then new thoughts came .
Why had not Hans told

her ?
It w as a
Shame !
It w as her father as well as his .

She was no baby .
She had once taken a sharp knife

from the father

’s hand .
She had even drawn him away

from the mother on that awful night when Hans , big as
he was , could not help her .
Why , then , must
Sh e be

treated like one who could do nothing ?
Oh , how very

Still it w as, how bitter, bitter cold !
If Annie Bouman

had only
Stayed home, instead of going to Amsterdam ,

it wouldn

’t be so lonely .
How cold her feet were grow

ing ! was it the moaning that made her feel as if Sh e were
ﬂoating in the air ?

This would not do : the mother might need her help

at any moment !

Rousing herself With an effort, Gretel sat upright,

rubbing her eyes and wondering,

-wondering that the

sky was so bright and blue,

— wondering at the stillness

in the cottage, more than all, at the laughter rising and
falling in the distance .

Soon she sank down again , the strange medley of

264
HANS BRINKER

thought growing more and more confused in her
b e

wildered brain .

What a strange lip the meester had !
How the stork

’s

nest upon the roof seemed to rustle and whisper down to
her !
How bright those knives were in the leathern

case I

— brighter, perhaps , than the
Silver
Skates .
If she

had but worn her new jacket, she would not
Shiver so .

The new jacket w as pretty,

— the only pretty thing she

had ever worn .
God had taken care of her father so

long, he would do it
Still, if those two men would but go

away .
Ah , now the
meester s were on the roof :
they

were clambering to the top

—
no, it w as her mother and

Hans ,

—
o r the storks

—
it w as so dark,
Wh o could tell,

and the mound rocking, swinging, i n that strange w ay ?
How sweetly the birds were
Singing !
They must be

winter birds ; for the air was thick with icicles

— not one

bird , but twenty .
Oh ! hear them, mother ;
wake me,

mother, for the race ;
I am
SO tired with crying, and

crying

A ﬁrm hand was laid upon her shoulder .

“ Get up , little girl !

”

not do, for you to lie here and freeze .

”

cried a kind voice .
This will

Gretel
slol
raised her head .
She
w as so sleepy,

that it seemed nothing
Strange to her that Hilda van

Gleck
Should be leaning over her, looking with kind ,

beautiful eyes into her face .
She had often dreamed it

before .

But
Sh e had never dreamed that Hilda was

' shaking

266
HANS BRINKER

take
off her own warm sack .
But Gretel suddenly sus

p ected her intention .

“ O j ufvr ouw, j ufvr ouw!
Sh e cried , imploringly .
Please

never think of such a thing as that!
Oh ! please keep it

on .
I am burning all over, 7

°
ufvr ouw!
I really am burn

ing .
Not burning, exactly, but pins and needles prick

ing all over me .
O j ufvr ouw, don

’t I

”

The poor child

’s dismay w a s
SO genuine, that Hilda

hastened to reassure her .

“ Very well, Gretel , move your arms then , so .
Why,

your cheeks are as pink as roses already .
I think the

meester would let you in now :
he certainly would .
Is

your father so very ill ?

”

“ Ah , j ufvr ouw,

”
cried
Gretel, weeping
afresh ,
he

is
dying, I
think .
There
are
two
meester s in with

him
at
this
moment ;
and
the
mother
has
scarce

spoken to-day .
Can you hear him moan, j ufvr ouw ?

”

she added with sudden terror :

“ the air buzzes so I

cannot hear .
He may be dead !
Oh , I
do wish I

could hear him I

”

.

Hilda listened .
The cottage w as very near, but not

a sound could be heard .

Something told her that Gretel was right .
She ran

to the window .

“ You cannot see there, my lady,
sobbed Gretel ,

eagerly ;

“ the mother has oiled paper hanging inside .

But at the other one, in the south end of the cottage,
you
can look in Where the paper is torn .

GRETEL
AND HILDA
267

Hilda , in her anxiety, ran round past the corner where

the low roof was fringed with its loosened thatch .

A

ﬁ sudd en thought checked her .

“ It is not right for me to peep into another

’s house

in this w ay,

” she said to herself; then , softly calling to

Gretel , she added in a whisper,
You may look ; perhaps

he is only
Sleeping .

”

Gretel tried to walk briskly toward the spot ; but

her limbs were trembling .
Hilda hastened to her sup

port .

“ You are sick, yourself, I fear,
she said , kindly .

No , not sick, j ufvr ouw;
but my heart cries all the

time now, even when my eyes are as dry as yours .
Why ,

j ufvr ouw, your eyes are not dry !
Are you crying for
us ?

0 j ufvr ouw, if God sees you !
Oh , I know father will

get better now !

” and the little creature, even while

reaching to look through the tiny window, kissed Hilda

’s

hand again and again .

The sash was sadly patched and broken ;
a torn piece

of paper hung half-way down across it .
Gretel

’s face

wa s pressed to the window .

“ Can you see anything ?

” whispered Hilda at last .

Yes ; the father lies very still , his head is bandaged ,

and all their eyes are fastened upon him .
O j ufvr ouw!

”

almost screamed Gretel , as she started back, and , by a
quick, dexterous movement , shook
off her heavy wooden

shoes ,
I must go in to my mother .
Will you come with

me ?

”

268
HANS
BRINKER

Not now, the hell is ringing .
I

soon .
Good -by

Gretel scarce heard the words .

many a day afterward , the bright , pitying
Hilda

’s face as she turned away .

270
HANS
BRINKER

Steady, steady !

” said a voice that sounded very

strange to Gretel .
Shift that mat higher, boys !
Now

throw on the clay .
The waters are rising fast ; no time

to

Dame Brinker sprang forward like a young panther .
She seized his hands , and , leaning over him, cried ,
Raff , Raff, boy, speak to me I

”

“ IS it you, M eitj e
he asked faintly .
I have been

asleep , hurt, I think .
Where is little Hans ?

“ Here I am, father !

” shouted Hans, half mad with

joy .
But the doctor held him back .

He knows us !

” screamed Dame Brinker .
Great

God Ihe knows us I Gretel, Gretel, come see your father I

”

In vain Dr .
Bockman commanded

“ silence !

”

and

tried to force them from the bedside .
He could not keep

them
off
.

Hans and his mother laughed and cried together as

they hung over the newly awakened man .
Gretel made

no sound , but gazed at them all with glad , startled eyes .
Her father was speaking in a faint voice,

“ Is
th e baby asleep , M eitj e

The baby I

”

e choed Dame Brinker .
O Gretel , that

is
you !
And he calls Hans ,

‘ little Hans .

’
Ten years

asleep !
O mynheer ! you have saved us all .
He has

known nothing for ten years .
Children, why don

’t you

thank the meester ?

The good woman
w as beside herself with joy

.
Dr .

Bockman said nothing ;
but , as his eyes met hers , he

THE AWAKENING
27 1

p omted upward .
She understood .
So did Hans and

Gretel .

With o ne accord they knelt by the cot, side by side .

Dame Brinker felt for her husband

’s hand even while

Sh e w as praying .
Dr . B oekm a n

’

s head w a s bowed .
The

assistant stood by the hearth with his back toward them .

“ Why do you pray ?

” murmured the father, looking

feebly from the bed as they rose .
Is it God

’s day ?

”

It w as not Sunday ;
but his
vr ouw bowed her head

she could not speak .

“Then w e should have a chapter,
said Raff Brinker,

speaking with difficulty .

“ I do not know how it is .
I

am very, very weak .
Mayhap the minister will read to

us ?

”

Gretel lifted the big Dutch Bible from its carved
Shelf.

Dr . Bockman , rather dismayed at being called a minister,
coughed , and handed the volume to his assistant .

“ Read ,

” he muttered .

“These people must be kept

quiet, or the man will die yet .

When the chapter was ﬁnished , Dame Brinker mo

tioned mysteriously to the rest, by w ay of telling them
that her husband was asleep .

“ Now, j ufvr ouw,

” said the doctor, in a subdued tone,

as he drew on his thick woollen mittens ,

“ there must be

perfect quiet .
You understand .
This is truly a most

remarkable case .
I
Shall come again to-morrow .
Give

the patient no food to-day ;

”
and , bowing hastily, he

left the cottage, followed by his assistant .

272
HANS BRINKER

His grand coach was not far away .
The driver had

kept the horses moving slowly up and down by the canal,
nearly all the time the doctor had been in the cottage .

Hans went out also .

“ May God bless you, mynheer !

” he said , blushing

and trembling,
I can never repay you ; but if

Yes, you can ,
interrupted the doctor, crossly .
You

can use your wits when the patient wakes again .
This

clacking and snivelling is enough to kill a well man , let
alone one lying on the edge of his grave .
If you want

your father to get well, keep

’em quiet .

”

So
saying,
Dr .
Bockman ,
without
another
word ,

stalked off to meet his coach , leaving Hans standing there
with eyes and mouth wide open .

Hilda was reprimanded severely that day for return

ing late to school after recess, and for imperfect recitations .

She had remained near the cottage until she heard

Dame Brinker laugh , until
Sh e had heard Hans say,

“ Here I am, father !

” and then
Sh e had gone back to

her lessons .
What wonder that she missed them !
How

could she get a long string of Latin verbs by heart , when
her heart did not care a ﬁg for them , but would keep
saying to itself,

“Oh !
I am so glad, I am so glad !

274
HANS
BRINKER

over his eyes would set up such an aching !
Request

him to go to the garret for your foot—stove, instantly
the bones would remind him that he w a s

“ too tired .

Ask him to go to the confectioner

’s , a mile away, and

p r esto ! not a bone would remember that it ever had been
used before .

Bearing all this in mind , you will not wonder when I

tell you that our ﬁve boys were among the happiest of
the happy throng pouring forth from the schoolhouse
that day .

Peter w a s in excellent
Spirits .
He had heard , through

Hilda , of Dame
B rinker

’

s laugh and of Hans

’s joyous

words ; and he needed no further proof that Raff Brinker

w a s a cured man .
In fact , the news had gone forth in

every direction for miles around .
Persons who had never

before cared for the B rinker s, or even mentioned them ,
except with a contemptuous sneer, or a shrug of pre
tended pity, now became singularly familiar with every
point of their history .
There was no end to the number

of ridiculous stories that were ﬂying
abOiit .

Hilda , in the excitement of the moment, had stopped

to exchange a word with the doctor

’s coachman as he

stood by the horses , pommelling his chest, and clapping
his hands .
Her kind heart was overﬂowing .
She could

not help pausing to tell the cold , tired -looking man , that

Sh e thought the doctor would be out soon :
she even

hinted to him that she suspected , only suspected , that a
wonderful cure had been performed ,

—
an idiot brought

to his senses .
Nay, she was sur e of it ; for Sh e had heard

his widow laugh

— no , not his widow, of course, but

his wife ; for the man was as much alive as anybody,
and , for all she knew, sitting up and talking like a

All this was very indiscreet .
Hilda , in an impenitent

sort of way, felt it to be so .

But it is always so delightful to impart pleasant or

surprising news !

She went tripping along by the canal, quite resolved

to repeat the sin ,
ad i nﬁ nitum, and tell nearly every girl

and boy in the school .

Meantime, Janz oon Kolp came skating by .
Of course,

in two seconds , he w a s
Striking
Slippery attitudes, and

shouting saucy things to the coachman , wh o stared at
him in indolent disdain .

This , to Janz oon, w a s equivalent to an invitation to

draw nearer .
The coachman was now upon his box,

gathering up the reins , and grumbling at his horses .

Ja nz oon accosted him .

“ I say .
What

’s going on at the idiot

’s cottage ?
Is

your boss in there ?

”

Coachman nodded mysteriously .

“ Whew !

” whistled Janz oon, drawing closer .
Old

Brinker dead

The driver grew big with importance, and silent in

See here, old pincushion , I

’d run home yonder, and

get you a chunk of gingerbread , if I thought you could
open your mouth .

”

Old pincushion
w as human :
long hours of waiting

had made him ravenously hungry .
At Janz oon

’

s hint,

his countenance showed signs of a collapse .

“ That

’s
right,
old
fellow !

”
pursued
his
tempter .

Hurry up ; what news ? old Brinker dead ?

”

No,

” said the coachman, shoot

ing forth his words, one at a time, like so many bullets .

Like bullets (ﬁguratively speaking) , they hit Janz oon

Kolp .
He jumped as if he had been Shot .

“ Goede Gunst !
You don

’t say so I

”

The man pressed his lips together, and looked
Sig

niﬁcantly toward Master K olp

Shabby residence .

Just then Janz oon saw a group of boys in the distance .

stamp all over the world ,

— whether in Africa , Japan ,

Amsterdam or Paris,

but
the

wonderful news .

Therefore, by sundown , it was well known through

out the neighboring country that Dr . Bockman , chancing
to stop at the cottage, had given the idiot Brinker a
tremendous dose of medicine as brown as gingerbread .
It had taken six men to hold him while it w as poured
down .
The idiot had immediately Sprung to his feet,

in full possession of all his faculties , knocked over the
doctor, or thrashed him (there

XXXVI

A
N EW ALARM

WHEN Dr . Bockman called the next day at the Brinker

cottage, he could not help noticing the cheerful, comfort
able aspect of the place .
An atmosphere of happiness

breathed upon him as he opened the door .
Dame Brinker

sat complacently knitting beside the bed ;
her husband

was enjoying a tranquil slumber ; and Gretel was noise
lessly kneading rye bread on the table in the corner .

The doctor did not remain long .
He asked a few simple

questions , appeared satisﬁed with the answers , and , after
feeling his patient

’s pulse, said ,

“Ah , very weak yet,

j ufvr ouw ;
very weak , indeed .
He must have nourish

ment .
You may begin to feed the patient , ahem !
Not

too much ; but what you do give him , let it be strong,
and of the best .

”

Black
bread
we
have ,
mynheer,
and
porridge,

replied Dame Brinker, cheerily .

“ They have always

agreed with him well .

”

“ Tut, tut !

” said the doctor, frowning :
nothing of

A NEW ALARM
279

the kind .
He must have the juice of fresh meat, white

bread dried and toasted , good Malaga wine, and

—
ahem !

The man looks cold : give him more covering, something
light and warm .
Where is the boy ?

”

Hans , mynheer, has gone into Broek to look for work .

He will be back soon . Will the meester please be seated

Whether the hard , polished stool offered by Dame

Brinker did not look particularly tempting, or whether
the dame herself frightened him, partly because
Sh e was

a woman, and partly because an anxious , distressed look
had suddenly appeared in her face, I cannot say .
Cer

tain it is , that our eccentric doctor looked hurriedly
about him, muttered something about

“ extraordinary

case,

” bowed , and disappeared , before Dame Brinker

had time to say another word .

Strange that the visit of their good benefactor
Should

have left a cloud ; yet so it w a s .
Gretel frowned ,

— an

anxious, childish frown ,

— and kneaded the bread-dough

Violently , without looking up .
Dame Brinker hurried

to her husband

’s bedside, leaned over him , and fell into

silent but passionate weeping .

In a moment Hans entered .

“ Why, mother !

” he whispered in alarm,
what ails

thee ?
Is the father worse ?

”

She turned her quivering face toward him, making

no attempt to conceal her distress .

“ Yes : he is starving, perishing .
The meester said it .

Hans turned pale .

280
HANS
BRINKER

What does this mean , mother ?
We must feed him

at once .
Here, Gretel, give me the porridge .

”

“ Nay !

” cried his mother, distractedly, yet without

raising her voice .

“ It may kill him .
Our poor fare is

too heavy for him .
O Hans ! he will die , the father will

die, if we use him this way .
He must have meat, and

Sweet wine, and a dek-bed .
Oh ! what shall I do, what

shall I do ?

”

She sobbed , wringing her hands .

“ There

is not a stiver in the house .

”

Gretel pouted : it w a s the only way she could express

sympathy just then .
Her tears fell one by one into the

dough .

“ Did the
meester
say he
must have these things,

mother ?

” asked Hans .

“Yes , he did .

”

Well, mother, don

’t
cry :
he shall have them.
I
Shall

bring meat and wine before night .
Take the cover from

my bed .
I can sleep in the straw .

Yes , Hans ;
but it is heavy, scant as it is .
The

meester said he must have something light and warm .
He will perish .
Our peat is giving out , Hans .
The father

has wasted it sorely, throwing it on when I was not look
ing, dear man .

”

“ Never mind , mother,
whispered Hans, cheerfully .

We can cut down the willow-tree and burn it , if need

be ;
but I

’ll bring home something to-night .
There

must be work in Amsterdam, though there

’s none in

Broek .
Never fear, mother :
the worst trouble of
a ll

282
HANS
BRINKER

Perhaps there is some mistake,
he thought .
The

meester surely would have known that meat and
Sweet

wine were not at our command .
And yet the father

looks very weak, he certainly does .
I must get work .

If Mynheer van Holp were back from
Rotterdam, I

could get plenty to do .
But Master Peter told me to

let him know if he could do aught to serve us .
I
Shall

go to him at once .
Oh , if it were but summer !

All this time Hans w a s hastening toward the canal .

Soon his skates were on ; and he was skimming rapidly
toward the residence of Mynheer
v an Holp .

“ The father must have meat and wine at once,
he

muttered .

“ But how can I earn the money in time to

buy them to-day ?
There is no other way but to go, as

I pr omised, to Master Peter .
What would a gift of meat

and wine be to him ?
When the father is once fed , I

can rush down to Amsterdam , and earn the morrow

’s

supply .

”

Then came other thoughts,

— thoughts that made his

heart thump heavily, and his cheeks burn with a new
shame .

“ It is beggi ng, to say the least .
Not one of the

B rinker s has ever been a beggar .
Shall I be the ﬁrst ?

Shall my poor father, just coming back into life, learn
that his family have asked for charity,

— h e, always
so

wise and thrifty ?
NO I

” cried Hans aloud ,

“ better a

thousand times to part with the watch .

“ I can at least borrow money on it in Amsterdam ,

he thought , turning around :

“ that will be no disgrace .

A NEW
ALARM
283

I can ﬁnd work at once, and get it back again .
Nay,

perhaps I can even
speak to the fa ther
about it.

”

This last thought almost made the lad dance for joy .

Why not , indeed , speak to the father ?
He was a ra

tion al being now .

“ He may wake,

”
thought Hans ,

“ quite bright and rested ; may tell us the watch is of no
consequence ;
to sell it , of course .
Huzza !

” and Hans

almost ﬂew over the ice .

A few moments more, and the Skates were again swing

ing from his arm .
He was running toward the cottage .

His mother met him at the door .

“ O Hans I

” she cried , her face radiant with joy,
the

young lady has been here with her maid .
She brought

everything,

— meat , jelly, wine and bread , a whole basket

ful I Then the meester sent a man from town with more
wine, and a ﬁne bed and blankets for the father .
Oh !

he will get well now .
God bless them I

”

“ God bless them !

” echoed Hans , and , for the ﬁrst

time that day, his eyes ﬁlled with tears .

THE FATHER

’S RETURN

THAT evening Raff Brinker felt
SO much better that

he insisted upon sitting up a while on the rough , high
backed chair by the ﬁre .
For a few moments there w a s

quite a commotion in the little

' cottage .
Hans was all

important on the occasion ;
for his father w a s a heavy

man , and needed something ﬁrm to lean upon .
The

dame, though none of your fragile ladies , w a s in such a

State of alarm and excitement at the bold step they were
taking in lifting him without the meester

’
s orders , that

She came near pulling her husband over, even while she
believed herself to be his main prop and support .

“ Steady, vr ouw, steady I

” panted Raff .

“ Have I grown

old and feeble
or is it the fever makes me thus helpless

Hear the man ?

” laughed Dame Brinker,

“ talking

like any other Christian .
Why, you

’re only weak from

the fever, Raff .
Here

’s the chair, settled snug and warm :

now sit thee down

—
hi-di-didy, there w e are I

”

With these words , Dame Brinker let her half of the

286
HANS
BRINKER

Tender little Gretel !
The prayer of her life was
an

swer ed through those tears .
She loved her father from

that moment .
Hans and his mother glanced silently at

each other when they
saw her spring toward him and

throw her arms about his neck .

“ Father, dear father,

”

Sh e whispered , pressing her

cheek close to his ,

“ don

’t
cry

.
We
are all here .

”

“ God bless thee,
sobbed Raff , kissing her again and

again .

“ I had forgotten that !

”

Soon he looked up again , and spoke in a cheerful voice .
I should know her,
vr ouw,

” he said , holding the sweet

young face between his hands, and gazing at it as though
he were watching it grow,

-“ I
Should know her .
The

same blue eyes, and the lips, and , ah , me ! the little song
she could Sing almost before she could stand .
But that

w as long ago,
he added with a sigh , still looking at her

dreamily,

“ long ago : it

’s all gone now .

“ Not
so,
indeed I

”
cried
Dame
Brinker,
eagerly .

Do you think I would let her forget it ?
Gretel, child,

sing the old song thou hast known so long .

Raff B rinker

’

s hands fell wearily, and his eyes closed ;

but it was something to see the smile playing about his
mouth , as Gretel

’s voice ﬂoated about him like an incense .

It was a simple air : she had never known the words .
With loving instinct
she softened every note, until

Raff almost fancied that his two-year-old baby was once
more beside him .

As soon as the song was
finished , Hans, laughing

THE FATHER

’S RETURN
287

softly, mounted a wooden
Stool, and began to rummage

in the cupboard .

“ Have a care, Hans ,
said Dame Brinker, wh o, through

all her poverty, was ever a tidy housewife,

—
“ have a care :

the wine is there at your right, and the white bread b e
yond it .

”

“ Never fear, mother,
answered Hans , reaching far

back on an upper shelf :
I shall do no mischief.

”

Jumping down, he walked toward
his father, and

placed an oblong block of pine wood in his hands .
One

of its ends w as rounded
off ;
and some deep cuts had

been made on the top .

“ Do you know what it is, father ? ” asked Hans .
Raff B rinker

’

s face brightened .
Indeed , I do, boy !

It is the boat I wa s making you yest

—
alack, not yester

day, but years ago .

”

I have kept it ever
Since, father : it can be ﬁnished

when your hand grows strong again .

“ Yes , but not for you, my lad .
I must wait for the

grandchildren .
Why, you are nearly a man .
Have you

helped your mother, boy, through all these years ?

”

“ Ay, and bravely I

” put in Dame Brinker .

Let me see,

” muttered the father, looking in a puz

z led w ay at them all :

“ how long is it since the night

when the waters were
coming in ?

’Tis the last
I

remember .

”

“ We have told thee true, Raff .
It was ten years last

Pinxter-week .

”

288
HANS
BRINKER

Ten years

— and I fell then, you say .
Has the fever

been on me ever since ?

”

Dame Brinker
Scarce knew how to reply .
Should she

tell him all ?
Tell him that he had been an idiot , almost

a lunatic ?
The doctor had charged her on no account

to worry or ex cite his patient .

Hans and Gretel looked astonished when the answer

came .

“ Like enough , Raff ,
Sh e said , nodding her head , and

raising her eyebrows .

“ When a heavy man like thee

falls on his head , it

’s hard to say what will come .
But

thou

’

r t well
now, Raff .
Thank the good Lord I

”

The newly awakened man bowed his head .

“ Ay, well enough , mine
vr ouw,

” he said , after a mo

ment

’s
Silence ;

“ but my brain turns, somehow, like a

spinning-wheel .
It will not be right till I get on the

dikes again .
When
Shall I be at work, think you ?

”

“ Hear the man !

” cried Dame Brinker, delighted , yet

frightened , too, for that matter .
We must get him on

the bed , Hans .
Work, indeed I

”

They tried to raise him from the chair ;
but he w as

not ready yet .

“ Be
off with ye I

” he said , with something like his old

smile (Gretel had never seen it before)

.

“ Does a man

want to be lifted about like a log ?
I tell you, before

three suns , I shall be on the dikes again .
Ah ! there

’ll

be some stout fellows to greet me .
Jan K amph uisen and

young Hoogsv liet .
They have been good friends to thee,

Hans , I

’ll warrant .

THE FATHER

’S
RETURN
289

Hans looked at his mother .
Young Hoogsv liet had

been dead ﬁve years .
Jan K amph uisen w as in the jail

at Amsterdam .

“ Ay, they

’d have done their share, no doubt,
said

Dame Brinker, parrying the inquiry,

“ had
w e asked

them .
But , what with Working and
Studying, Hans has

been busy enough without seeking comrades .

”

“ Working and studying,

” echoed Raff , in a musing

tone .

“ Can the youngsters read and cipher, M eitj e ?

“You
Should
hear
them !

”

Sh e
answered
proudly .

They can run through a book while I mop the ﬂoor .

Hans, there, is as happy over a page of big words as a
rabbit in a cabbage-patch ; as for ciphering

“ Here, lad , help a bit ,
interrupted Raff Brinker :
I

must get me on the bed again .

”

THE THOUSAND GUILDERS

NONE seeing the humble supper eaten in the Brinker

cottage that night would have dreamed of the dainty
fare hidden away near by .
Hans and Gretel looked

rather wistfully toward the cupboard as they drank their
cupful of water, and ate their scanty share of black bread ;
but even in thought they did not rob their father .

“ He relished his supper well,
said Dame Brinker,

nodding sidewise toward the bed ,

“ and fell asleep the

next moment .
Ah , the dear man will be feeble for many

a day .
He wanted sore to Sit up again ; but while I made

Show of humoring him, and getting ready , he dropped
off .

Remember that , my girl, when you have a man of your

own (and many a day may it be before that comes to
pass) ,

— remember you can never rule by differing :

‘ hum

ble wife is husband

’s boss .

’
Tut, tut ! never swallow

such a mouthful as that again , child :
why, I could make

a meal
off of two such pieces .
What

’s in thee, Hans ?

One would think there were cobwebs on the wall .

292
HANS
BRINKER

I am glad you are feeling better,
he said , leaning

over his father .

“Another day will see you quite
Strong

again .

”

“ Ay, like enough .
How long did the money last , Hans

I could not hear your mother .
What did she say ?

”

“ I said , Raff ,
stammered Dame Brinker in great

distress ,
that it w a s all gone .

“ Well, well , wife, do not fret at that :
one thousand

guilders is not so very much for ten years , and with
children to bring up ; but it has helped to make you all
comfortable .
Have you had much
Sickness to bear

“ N

— no ,

” sobbed the dame, lifting her apron to her

eyes .

“ Tut

— tut , woman , why do you cry ?

”
said
Raff ,

kindly .

“ We will soon ﬁll another pouch , when I am on

my feet again .
Lucky I told you all about it before I

fell

Told me what, man ?
Why, that I buried the money .
In my dream just

now, it seemed I had never said aught about it .

”

Dame Brinker Started forward .
Hans caught her arm .

“ Hist
mother !

” he whispered , hastily leading her

away :
we must be very careful .
Then , while she

stood with clasped hands , waiting in breathless anxiety,
he once
more
approached
the cot .
Trembling with

eagerness he said ,

“ That was a troublesome dream .
Do you remember

when you buried the money, father ?

THE THOUSAND GUILDERS
293

Yes, my boy .
It was before daylight on the same day

I was hurt .
Jan K amph uisen said something, the sun

down before, that made me distrust his honesty .
He

w as the only one living, besides mother, wh o knew we
had saved a thousand guilders : so I rose up that night,
and buried the money

.
Blockhead that I was, ever to

suspect an old friend I

”

“ I

’ll be bound , father,
pursued Hans , in a laughing

voice, motioning to his mother and Gretel to remain
quiet ,

“ that you

’ve forgotten where you buried it .

”

“ Ha , ha ! not I , indeed .
But good -night , my son, I

can sleep again .

”

Hans would have walked
away ;
but his mother

’s

gestures were not to be disobeyed : so he said gently,

“ Good-night, father !
Where did you say you buried

the money ?
I w a s only a little one then .

”

“ Close by the willow-sapling behind the cottage,

said Raff Brinker, drowsily .

“ Ah , yes !
North Side of the tree, wasn

’t it , father ?

No, the south side .
Ah , you know the spot well

enough , you rogue .
Like enough you were there when

your mother lifted it .
Now, son , easy ; shift this pillow,

so
Good-night !
Good-night , father !
said Hans, ready to dance for

The moon rose very late that night , shining in , full

and clear, at the little

'
window ;
but its beams did not

HANS
BRINKER

disturb Raff Brinker .
He
Slept soundly ; so did Gretel .

As for Hans and his mother, they had something else
to do .

After making a few hurried preparations, they
Stole

forth with bright , expectant faces, bearing a broken
spade and a rusty implement that had done many a
day

’s service when Raff was a hale worker on the dikes .

It was so light out of doors, they could see the willow

tree distinctly .
The frozen ground w a s hard as stone ;

but Hans and his mother were resolute .
Their only

dread was, that they might disturb the sleepers in the
cottage .

“ This ysbr eeker is just the thing, mother,
said Hans ,

striking many a vigorous blow ;

“ but the ground has

set so ﬁrm , it

’ll be a fair match for it .

”

“Never
fear,
Hans ,

’

Sh e
answered , watching
him

eagerly .
Here, let me try a while .

”

They soon succeeded in making an impression ;
one

opening, and the rest was not so difficult .

Still they worked on , taking turns , and whispering

cheerily to one another .
Now and then Dame Brinker

stepped noiselessly over the threshold , and listened , to
be certain that her husband slept .

“ What grand news it will be for him

money was
not ther e !

ANNIE BOUMAN had a healthy distaste for Janz oon

Kolp .
Janz oon Kolp , in his own rough way, adored

Annie .
Annie declared she could not ,

“ to save her life,

say one civil word to that odious boy .
Janz oon believed

her to be the
Sweetest, sauciest creature in the world .

Annie laughed among her playmates at the comical ﬂap
ping
of Janz oon

’

s tattered and dingy jacket : he sighed

in solitude over the ﬂoating grace of her jaunty blue
petticoat .
She thanked her
Stars that her brothers were

not like the K olp s; and he growled at his
Sister because

she was not like the Boumans.
They seemed to exchange

natures whenever they met .
His presence made her

harsh and unfeeling ; and the very sight of her made him
gentle as a lamb .
Of course, they were thrown together

very often .
It is thus, that, in some mysterious way,

we are convinced of error, and cured of prejudice .

In this case, however, the scheme failed .
Annie de

tested Janz oon more and more at each encounter ;
and

Janz oon liked her better and better every day .

298
HANS
BRINKER

He killed a
Stork, the wicked old wr etch I she would

say to herself.

She
knows
I
am
strong
and
fearless,
thought

Janz oon .

“ How red and freckled and ugly he is I

” was Annie

’s

secret comment when
Sh e looked at him .

“ How
Sh e
stares,
and
stares !

”
thought
Janz oon .

Well, I am a ﬁne, weather-beaten fellow, anyway .

”

“ Janz oon Kolp , you impudent boy, go right away

from me I

” Annie often said .
I don

’t want any of your

company .

“ Ha , ha I

” laughed Janz oon to himself.
Girls never

say what they mean .
I

’ll skate with her every chance

I can get .

”

And so it came to pass that the pretty maid would

not look up that morning, when, skating homeward
from Amsterdam,
Sh e became convinced that a great,

burly boy w a s coming down the canal toward her .

“ Humph ! if I look at him,

“ I

“ Good-morrow again, Annie !

change at our house
Since you left .

”

“ How so
Sh e exclaimed , opening her eyesvery wide .

300
HANS
BRINKER

Of course I am,
he replied , looking up with a smile .

Well, Hans , if you a r e going to sell your skates,

” said

Annie, somewhat confused ,
I mean if you

— well, I

know somebody who would like to buy them : that

’s all .

“ Not Janz oon Kolp
asked Hans , ﬂushing .

Oh , no I

” she pouted

“ He is not one of my friends .

But you know him ,
persisted Hans .

Annie laughed .

“ Yes , I know him ;
and it

’s all the

worse for him that I do .
Now please, Hans , don

’t ever

talk any more to me about Janz oon .
I hate him I

”

“ Hate him ?
You hate any one, Annie ?

”

She
Shook her head saucily .

“ Yes ; and I

’ll hate you

too , if you persist in calling him one of my friends .
You

boys may like him , because he caught the greased goose
at the K er mis last summer, and climbed the pole with
his great ugly body tied up in a sack ; but I don

’t care

for such things .
I

’ve disliked him ever since I saw him

try to push his little sister out of the merry-go-round at
Amsterdam ;
and it

’s no secret up our way who killed

the Stork on your mother

’s roof.
But we mustn

’t talk

about such a bad , wicked fellow .
Really, Hans, I know

somebody who would be glad to buy your
Skates .
You

won

’t get half a price for them in Amsterdam .
Please

give them to me .
I

’ll take you the money this very

afternoon .

”

If Annie wa s charming even when
She said
hate,

there w a s no withstanding her when she said
please :

at least, Hans found it to be so .

off the Skates, and rubbing

them carefully with a snarl of twine before handing them
to her,

“ I am sorry to be so particular ; but , if your friend

I must buy peat and meal for the mother early

“ runners
from his

capacious pockets, and fastened them on as best he could ,
he did not hear Annie murmur,

“ I wish I had not been so

rude ;
poor, brave Hans !
What a noble boy he is !

”

And as Annie skated homeward , ﬁlled with pleasant
thoughts ,
Sh e did not hear Hans say,

“ I grumbled like

a bear .
But bless her ! some girls are like angels I

”

Perhaps it was all for the best .
One cannot be ex

p ected to know everything that is going on in the world .

XL

LOOKING FOR WORK

LUXURIES unﬁt us for returning to hardships easily

endured before .
The wooden runners squeaked more

than ever .
It was as much as Hans could do to get on

with the clumsy old things ; still he did not regret that
he had parted with his beautiful skates, but resolutely
pushed back the boyish trouble that he had not been
able to keep them just a little longer, at least, until after
the race .

“ Mother surely will not be angry with me,
he thought,

for selling them without her leave .
She has had care

enough already .
It will be full time to speak of it when

I take home the money .

Hans went up and down the streets of Amsterdam that

day, looking for work .
He succeeded in earning a few

stivers by assisting a man wh o w as driving a train of
loaded mules into the city ;
but he could not secure

steady employment anywhere .
He would have been

glad to obtain a
Situation as porter or errand-boy ; but

words ; and , before morning, one man actually resolved ,
that, if the Broek boy came in again , he would instruct
his head man Blanker t to set him at something .

But Hans knew nothing of all this .
Toward sundown

he
Started on his return to Broek, uncertain whether the

strange, choking sensation in his throat arose from dis

cour agem ent, or resolution .
There w a s one more chance .

Mynheer
v an Holp might have returned by this time .

Master Peter, it was reported , had gone to Haarlem to
attend to something connected with the great skating
race .
Still Hans would go and try .

Fortunately Peter had returned early that morning .

He was at home when Hans reached there, and was just
about starting for the Brinker cottage .

“Ah , Hans !

” he cried as the weary boy approached

the door

“ You are the very one I wished to see .
Come

in , and warm yourself.

”

After tugging at his well-worn
hat , which
always

would
Stick to his head when he was embarrassed , Hans

knelt down ,

— not by way of making a new style of Orien

tal salute, nor to worship the goddess of cleanliness who
presided there, but because his heavy shoes would have
ﬁlled the soul of a Broek housewife with horror .
When

their owner stepped softly into the house, they were
left outside to act as sentinels until his return .

Hans left the Van Holp mansion with a lightened heart .

Peter had brought word
from
Haarlem
that
young

LOOKING FOR WORK
305

Brinker was to commence working upon the summer
house doors immediately .
There
w as
a
comfortable

workshop on the place ; and it w a s to be at his service
until the carving was done .

Peter did not tell Hans that he had skated all the way

to Haarlem for the purpose of arranging this plan with
Mynheer van Holp .
It was enough for him to see the

glad , eager look rise on young B rinker

’

s face .

“ I think I can do it,

” said Hans ,
though I have never

learned the trade .

”

“ I am sure you can ,
responded Peter, heartily .
You

will ﬁnd

‘ every tool you require in the workshop .
It is

nearly hidden yonder by that wall of twigs .
In summer,

when the hedge is green, one cannot see the shop from
here at all .
How is your father to-day

“ Better, mynheer : he improves every hour .

It is the most astonishing thing I ever heard of.

That gruff old doctor is a great fellow, after all .

”

“ Ah , mynheer !

” said Hans, warmly,

“ he is more

than great : he is good .
But for the meester

’
s kind heart

and great
Skill, my poor father would yet be in the dark .

I think, mynheer,

” he added with kindling eyes,
sur

gery is the very noblest science in the world .

”

Peter shrugged his shoulders .

“ Very noble it may be,

but not quite to my taste .
This Dr . Boekman certainly

has skill .
As for his heart

— defend me from such hearts

as his !

“ Why do you say so, mynheer
asked Hans .

306
HANS BRINKER

Just then a lady slowly entered from an adjoining

apartment .
It was M ev r ouw van Holp , arrayed in the

grandest of caps , and the longest of satin aprons , rufﬂed
with lace .
She nodded placidly as Hans stepped back

from the ﬁre, bowing as well as he knew how .

Peter at once drew a high -backed oaken chair toward

the ﬁre ; and the lady seated herself.
There w a s a block

of cork on each side of the chimney-place .
One of these

he placed under his mother

’s feet .

Hans turned to go .

“Wait a moment, if you please, young man ,
said the

lady .

“ I accidentally overheard you and my son speak

ing, I think, of my friend Dr . B oekm an .
You are right,

young man .
Dr .
Bockman has a very kind heart .

You perceive, Peter, w e may be quite mistaken in judging
of persons solely by their manners ; though a courteous
deportment is by no means to be despised .

I intended no disrespect, mother,
said Peter ;
but

surely one has no right to go growling and snarling through
the world as they say he does .

”

‘ They say .

’
Ah , Peter !

‘ they

’ means everybody

or nobody .
Surgeon B oekm an has had a great sorrow .

Many years ago he lost his only Child , Under very pain
ful circumstances ,

— a ﬁne lad , except that he was a

thought
too
hasty
and
high-spirited .
Before
then,

Gerard B oekm an wa s one of the most agreeable gentle
men I ever knew .

”

So saying, M ev r ouw van Holp , looking kindly upon

308
HANS
BRINKER

look of puzzled surprise when he saw Hans kneel
by the canal, and put on the wooden skates .

“ Very queer !

” muttered Peter,
Shaking his head

he turned to go into the house .

“ Why in the world

don

’t the boy wear his new ones ?

XLI

THE FAIRY GODMOTHE R

THE sun had gone down quite out of sight , when our

hero, with a happy heart, but something like a sneer on
his countenance as he jerked
off the wooden

“ runners ,

”

trudged
hopefully toward the tiny hut-like building,

known of old as the

“ Idiot

’s Cottage .

Duller eyes than his would have discerned two slight

ﬁgures moving near the doorway .

That gray, well-patched jacket, and the dull blue

skirt, covered with an apron of still duller blue ;
that

faded , close-ﬁtting cap ;
and those quick little feet in

their great boat-like shoes,

— they were Gretel

’s, of course .

He would have known them anywhere .

That bright , coquettish , red jacket, with its pretty

Skirt bordered with black ;
that graceful cap bobbing

over the gold ear-rings ;
that dainty apron ;
and those

snug leather Shoes that seemed to have grown with the
feet ,

— why, if the Pope of Rome had sent them to him

by express , Hans could have sworn they were Annie

’s .

The two girls were slowly pacing up and down in

3 10
HANS
BRINKER

front of the cottage .
Their arms were intertwined , of

course ;
and their heads were nodding and shaking as

emphatically as if all the affairs of the kingdom were
under discussion .

With a joyous
Shout Hans hastened toward them .

“ Huzza , girls , I

’ve found work !

”

This brought his mother to the cottage-door .
She, too, had pleasant tidings .
The father was still

improving .
He had been sitting up nearly all day, and

w a s
now
Sleeping, as Dame Brinker declared ,

“just as

quiet as a lamb .

”

“ It is my turn now, Hans,
said Annie, drawing him

aside, after he had
told

' his mother the good word from

Mynheer van Holp .
Your skates are sold , and here

’s

the money .

”

“ Seven guilders !
cried Hans , counting the pieces in

astonishment

“ why, that is three times as much as I

paid for them .

“ I cannot help that,
said Annie .
If the buyer knew

no better, it is not our fault .

Hans looked up quickly .

“ O Annie !

O Hans !

”

Sh e mimicked , pursing her lips, and try

ing to look desperately wicked and unprincipled .

Now, Annie , I know you would never mean that !

You must return some of this money

“ But I

’ll not do any such thing,
insi sted Annie .

They

’re sold ; and that

’s the end of it .

”
Then , seeing

31 2
HANS
BRINKER

They slipped behind the cottage,
said Hans ,
like

enough to hide from us .
Hist !
I

’ll catch them for you .

They both can move quicker and softer than yonder
rabbit ; but I

’ll give them a good start ﬁrst .

“Why, there is a rabbit , sure enough .
Hold , Hans !

the poor thing must have been in sore need to venture
from its burrow this bitter weather .
I

’ll get a few crumbs

for it within .

”

So saying, the good woman bustled into the cottage .

She soon came out again ;
but Hans had forgotten to

wait, and the rabbit, after taking a cool survey of the
premises , had scampered off to unknown quarters .
Turn

ing the corner of the cottage, Dame Brinker came upon
the children .
Hans and Gretel were Standing before

Annie, wh o was seated carelessly upon a stump .

“ That is as good as a picture !

” cried Dame Brinker,

halting in admiration of the group .

“ Many a painting

have I seen at the grand house at Heidelberg not a whit
prettier .
My two are rough chubs, Annie ; but you look

like a fairy .

”

“ Do I ?

” laughed Annie, sparkling with animation .

Well, then , Gretel and Hans, imagine I

’m your god

mother, just paying you a visit .
Now, I

’ll grant you

each a wish .
What will you have, Master Hans ?

”

A shade of earnestness passed over Annie

’s face as

she looked up at him ; perhaps it was because she wished
from the depths of her heart that for once she could have
a fairy

’s power .

THE
FAIRY GODMOTHER
313

Something whispered to Hans that for the moment

She was more than mortal .

“ I wish ,

” said he, solemnly,
I could ﬁnd something

I w a s searching for last night .

”

Gretel
laughed
merrily .
Dame
Brinker
moaned ,

Shame on you, Hans !

” and passed wearily into the

cottage .

The fairy godmother sprang up, and stamped her foot

three times .

“ Thou shalt have thy wish ,
said
She,
let them say

what they will .
Then, with playful solemnity, she put

her hand into her apron-pocket, and drew forth a large
glass bead .

“ Bury this,
said
Sh e, giving it to Hans ,

“ where I have
Stamped , and ere moonrise thy wish shall

be granted .

”

Gretel laughed more merrily than ever .
The godmother pretended great displeasure .

“ Naughty child !

” said she, scowling terribly .
In

punishment for laughing at a fairy, thy wish
Shall not be

granted .

”

“ Ha !

” cried Gretel, in high glee .
Better wait till

you

’re asked , godmother .
I haven

’t made any wish !

Annie acted her part well .
Never smiling through all

their merry laughter, she
stalked away, the embodiment

of offended dignity .

“ Good -night, fairy !

” they cried again and again .

“Good-night , mortals !

” she called out at last as
Sh e

sprang over a frozen ditch , and ran toward her home .

314
HANS
BRINKER

Oh Iisn

’t sh e

— just like ﬂowers , so sweet and lovely !

cried Gretel, looking after her in great admiration .

“ And

to think how many days Sh e stays in that dark room with
her grandmother .
See !
Sh e has stopped .
Why, brother

Hans I What is the matter ? What are you going to do

“ Wait and see !

” answered Hans, as he plunged into

the cottage, and came out again , all in an instant, bear
ing the spade and ysbr eeker in his hands .

“ Call Annie !

I

’m going to bury my magic h ead I

”

Raff Brinker still slept soundly .
His wife took a small

block of peat from her nearly exhausted
Store, and put

it upon the embers .
Then, opening the door,
Sh e called

gently,

“ Come in , children !

Mother, mother !
See here !

” shouted Hans .

Holy St .
Bavon I

” exclaimed the dame, springing

over the doorstep .

“ What has come to the boy ?

”

“ Come quick, mother,

” he cried , in great excitement ,

working with all his might , and driving in the ysbr eeker
at each word .

“ Don

’t you
see ?
This is the spot,

right here on the south side of the stump .
Why didn

’t

w e think of it last night ?
The stump is the
Old willow

tree,

— the one you cut down last spring, because it

sh aded the potatoes .
That little tree wasn

’t here whe n

father
Huzza I

”

Dame Brinker could not speak .
She dropped on her

knees beside Hans just in time to see him drag forth

the
old
stone pot!

THE FAIRY GODMOTHER
31 5

He thrust in his hand , and took out—
a piece of brick,

then another, then another, then the
Stocking and the

pouch, black and mouldy, but ﬁlled with the long-lost
treasure .

Such a time !
Such laughing ! such crying ! such count

ing, after they went into the cottage .
It w a s a wonder

that Raff did not waken .
His dreams were pleasant,

however ; for he smiled in his sleep .

Dame Brinker and her children had a ﬁne supper, I

can assure you .
No need of saving the delicacies now .

“ We

’ll buy the father some nice, fresh things to

morrow,
said the dame, as
Sh e brought forth the meat,

wine, bread and jelly that Hilda had sent, and placed
them on the clean pine table .

“Ah , but the good man

Shall have comforts enough and to spare, so he
Shall,

bless him !
Is it not so, Hans ?
Sit by, children, sit by .

That night Annie fell asleep , wondering whether it

w a s a knife Hans had lost, and thinking how funny it
would be if he should ﬁnd it, after all .

Hans had scarce closed his eyes , before he found him

self trudging through
a thicket : pots of gold were lying

all around ; and watches and
Skates and glittering beads

were swinging from every branch .

Strange to say, each tree, as he approached it, changed

into a stump ;
and on the
Stump sat the prettiest fairy

imaginable clad in a scarlet jacket and blue petticoat .

XLII

THE MYSTERIOUS WATCH

SOMETHING else than the missing guilders was brought

to light on the day of the fairy godmother

’s visit .
This

w a s the
Story of the watch , that for ten long years had

been
so jealously
guarded
by
Raff

’s
faithful
vr ouw

,

Through many an hour of sore temptation she had dreaded
almost to look upon it, lest she might be tempted to dis
obey her husband

’s request .
It had been hard to see her

children hungry, and to know that the watch , if sold ,
would enable the roses to bloom in their cheeks again .

“ But nay,
she would exclaim,

“ M eitj e Brinker is not

one to forget her man

’s last bidding, come what may .

”

“ Take good care of this , mine
vr ouw,

” he had said as

he handed it to her : that was all .
No explanation fol

lowed ; for the words were scarcely Spoken , when one of
his
fellow-workmen
rushed
into
the
cottage,
crying,

Come, man !
The waters are rising !
You

’re wanted

on the dikes .

”

Raff had started at once ; and that, as Dame Brinker

3 16

318
HANS BRINKER

Well, if not, since it

’s no affair of ours, we

’ll say
no

more about it,

” said Raff , shaking his head sadly .

“ Like

enough , while I

’ve been dead on the earth , all this time,

the poor boy

’s died , and been in heaven .
He looked near

enough to it, poor lad I

”

“ Raff Brinker !
If you

’re going to treat me this w ay,

and I nursing you and h ea ring with you
Since I was

twenty-two years old , it

’s a shame ;
ay, and a disgrace I

”

cried the
vr ouw, growing quite red , and scant of breath .

Raff

’s voice was feeble yet :

“ Treat you
what way,

M eitj e

“What
way ?

”
said
Dame
Brinker,
mimicking his

voice and manner,

“what w ay ?
Why, just as every

woman in the world is treated after she

’s Stood by a

man through the worst, like
a

“ M eitj e !

”

Raff
was
leaning
forward with
outstretched
arms .

His eyes were full of tears .

In an instant Dame Brinker w as at his feet, clasping

his hand in hers .

“ Oh, what have I done !
Made my good man cry,

and he not back with me four days !
Look up , Raff I

Nay, Raff , my own boy, I

’m sorry I hurt thee .
It

’s hard

not to be told about the watch , after waiting ten years
to know ; but I

’ll ask thee no more, Raff .
Here, we

’ll

put the thing away that

’s made the ﬁrst trouble between

us , after God just giving thee back to me .

”

“ I w as a fool to
c ry, M eitj e,

” he said , kissing her ;

THE MYSTERIOUS WATCH
319

and it s no more than right ye should know the truth .

But it seemed like it might be telling the secrets of the
dead to talk about the matter .

”

“ Is the man

— the lad

— thou wert talking of dead ,

think thee ?

” asked th e
vr ouw, hiding the watch in her

hand , but seating herself expectantly on the end of his
long foot-bench .

“ It

’s hard telling,
he answered .

Was he so sick, Raff ?

”

No, not sick, I may say, but troubled ,
vr ouw,

— very

troubled

“ Had he done any wrong, think ye
she asked , lower

ing her voice .

Raff nodded .

“ M u rder ?

” whispered the wife, not daring to look up .

He said it was like to that, indeed .

”

O Raff Iyou frighten me .
Tell me more— you speak

so strange ; and you tremble .
I must know all .

”

“ If I tremble, mine
vr ouw, it must be from the fever .

There is no guilt on my soul, thank God I

”

“ Take a
Sip of this wine, Raff .
There, now you are

better .
It was like to a crime, you were saying ?

”

“ Ay, M eitj e,

— like to murder :
that he told me him

self.
But I

’ll never believe it .
A likely lad , fresh and

honest-looking as our own youngster, but with some
thing not so bold and
Straight about him .

”

“ Ay, I know,
said the dame, gently, fearing to in

ter r up t the story .

329
HANS BRINKER

He came upon me quite sudden,
continued Raff .

I had never seen his face before,

— the palest , fright

enedest face that ever was .
He caught me by the arm .

‘ You look like an honest man ,

’ says he .

”

“ Ay, he was right in that,

” interrupted the dame,

emphatically .

Raff looked somewhat bewildered .

“Where wa s I , mine
vr ouw?

”

The lad took hold of your arm , Raff ,
she said ,

gazing at him anxiously .

“ Ay, so .
The words come awkward to me ; and every

thing is half like a dream , ye see .

”

“ S-stut !
What wonder, poor man I

” sighed the dame,

stroking his hand .

“ If ye had not head enough for a

dozen, the wit would never have come to ye again .
Well,

the lad caught ye by the arm, and said ye looked honest

(well he might)

.
What then ?
Was it noontime ?

“ Nay, before daylight,

— long before early chimes .

It w a s the same day you were hurt,

” said the dame .

I know it seemed you went to your work in the middle of

the night .
You left off where he caught your arm, Raff .

“Yes,

” resumed her husband ;

“ and I can see his face

this minute,

-so white and wild looking .

‘ Take me down

the river a w ay,

’ says he .
I was working then, you

’ll

remember, far down on the line, across from Amsterdam .
I told him I w a s no boatman .

‘ It

’s an affair of life and

death ,

’ says he,

‘ take me on a few miles .
Yonder skiff

is not locked ; but it may be a poor man

’s boat and I

’d

322
HANS
BRINKER

Where were you ?
Why, not very far, forsooth .
The

lad hadn

’t yet given ye the watch .
Alack !
I misgive

whether he came by it honestly .

”

“ Why,
vr ouw !

” exclaimed Raff , in an injured tone .

He was dressed soft and ﬁne as the prince himself.
The

watch was his own, clear enough .

“ How came he to give it up ?

” asked the dame, look

ing uneasily at the ﬁre ;
for it needed another block of

peat .

“ I told ye just
now,
he answered with a puzzled air .

Tell me again ,

’ said Dame Brinker, wisely patient .

Well, just before jumping from the boat, he says ,

handing me the watch ,

‘ I

’m ﬂying from my country, as

I never thought I could .
I trust you, because you look

honest .
Will you take this to my father,

-not to-day,

but in a week, and tell him his unhappy boy sent it ; and
tell him, if ever the time comes that he wants me to
come back to him, I

’ll brave everything, and come .
Tell

There, the Test is all gone
him to send a letter to— to
from me .
I
ca n

’t remember where the letter w a s to go .

Poor lad , poor lad !

” resumed Raff , sorrowfully, taking

the watch from his
vr ouw

’
s lap as he spoke ;
and it

’s

never been sent to his father to this day .

”

“ I

’ll take it, Raff , never fear, the moment Gretel gets

back .
She will be in soon .
What was the father

’s name,

did you say ?
Where were you to ﬁnd him ?

”

Alack !
answered Raff , speaking very slowly,

“ it

’s

all slipped me .
I can see the lad

’s face, and his great eyes

THE MYSTERIOUS WATCH
323

ju st as plain Iand I remember his opening the watch , and
snatching something from it , and kissing it .
But no

more .
All the rest whirls past me .
There

’s a sound like

rushing waters comes over me when I try to think .

“ Ay

.
That

’s plain to see, Raff; but I

’ve had the same

feeling after a fever .
You

’re tired now ;
I must get ye

straight on the bed again .
Where is the child , I wonder

Dame Brinker opened the door, and called ,

“ Gretel ,

(3retel ?

”

“ Stand aside,
vr ouw,
said Raff , feebly, as he leaned

forward , and endeavored to look out upon the bare land
scape .

“ I

’ve half a mind to stand beyond the door just

oncef

’

“ Nay, nay,
Sh e laughed .

“ I

’ll tell the meester how

ye tease and ﬁdget and bother to be let out in the air ;
and , if he says it, I

’ll bundle ye warm to-morrow, and

give ye a turn on your feet .
But I

’m freezing you with

this door open .
I declare, if there isn

’t Gretel , with her

apron full, skating on the canal like wild .
Why, man I

”

she continued almost in a scream , as she slammed the
door,

“

th ou

’

r t walking to the bed without my touching

thee !
Thou

’lt fall !

”

The dame

’s

“ thee
proved her mingled fear and de

light, even more than the rush which
Sh e made toward

her husband .
Soon he was comfortably settled under

the new cover, declaring, as his
vr ouw tucked him in

snug and warm , that it was the last daylight that should

324
HANS
BRINKER

Ay I I can hope it myself,
laughed Dame Brinker,

now you have been frisking about at that rate
As

Raff closed his eyes , the dame hastened to revive her
ﬁre, or, rather, to dull it ; for Dutch peat is like a Dutch
man , slow to kindle, but very good at a blaze when once
started .
Then,
putting
her
neglected
spinning-wheel

away,
Sh e drew forth her knitting from some invisible

pocket, and seated herself by the bedside .

“ If you could remember that man

’s name, Raff,
she

began cautiously,

“ I might take the watch to him while

you

’re sleeping : Gretel can

’t but be in soon .

”

Raff tried to think, but in vain .

“ Could it be
Boomphoffen ?

”
suggested the dame .

“ I

’ve heard how they

’ve had two sons turn out bad ,

Gerard and Lambert .

“ It might be,

” said Raff .
Look if there

’s letters on

the watch : that

’ll guide us some .

”

“ Bless thee, man ! ” cried the happy dame, eagerly

lifting the watch :
why,

Sharper than ever !

Sure enough .
Here

Seems to me,

there

to make out .
But you

XLIII

A DISCOVERY

THE next sun brought a busy day to the B rinker s .

In the ﬁrst place, the news of the thousand guilders had ,
of course, to be told to the father .
Such tidings as that

surely could not harm him .
Then , while Gretel was dili

gently obeying her mother

’s injunction to

“ clean the

place fresh as a new brewing,

” Hans and the dame sal

lied
forth
to
revel
in
the
purchasing
of peat
and

provisions .

Hans
w as careless
and
contented ;
the
dame
w as

ﬁlled with delightful anxieties caused by the unreason
able demands
of ten thousand guilders

’ worth of
new

wants that had sprung up like mushrooms in a single
night .
The happy woman talked so largely to Hans on

their way to Amsterdam , and brought back such little
bundles after all, that he scratched his bewildered head
as
he
leaned
against
the
chimney-piece,
wondering

whether,

“ bigger the pouch , tighter the String

” was in

3 26

A DISCOVERY
327

Jacob Cats , and therefore true, or whether he had dreamed
it when he lay in a fever .

“ What thinking on, Big-eyes
chirruped his mother,

half-reading his thoughts as she bustled about, prepar
ing the dinner,

“ what thinking on ?
Why, Raff , would

ye believe it
the child thought to carry half Amsterdam

back on his head !
Bless us ! he would have bought as

much coffee as would have ﬁlled this
ﬁ r e-pot .

‘ No,

no, my lad I

lad en ;

’
and then how he stared I

—
ay, just as he

stares this minute

— Hoot, lad ! ﬂy around a mite .
Ye

’ll

grow to the chimney-place with your staring and won
dering .
-Now, Raff , here

’s your chair at the head of

the table, where it should be, for there

’s a MAN to the

house now : I

’d say it to the king

’s face .
Ay, that

’s the

w ay; lean on Hans : there

’s a Strong staff for you ! Grow

ing like a weed too, and it seems only yesterday Since
he was toddling .
Sit by, my man, sit by .

”

“ Can you call to mind ,
vr ouw,

” said Raff , settling

himself cautiously in
the
big
chair,
the wonderful

music-box that cheered your working in the big house at
Heidelberg

“ Ay, that I can I

” answered the dame .
Three turns

of a brass key, and the witchy thing would send the
music fairly running up and down one

’s back :
I
r e

member
it well .
But, Raff
(growing solemn in an

instant) ,

“you would never throw our guilders away

for a thing like that ?

”

328
HANS BRINKER

No, no ! not I , vr ouw;
for the good Lord has already

given me a music-box without pay .

”

All three cast quick, frightened glances at one
an

other and at Raff .
Were his wits on the wing again ?

“ Ay, and a music-box that ﬁfty pouchful would not

buy from me,

” insisted Raff .

“ And it

’s set going by

the turn of a mop-handle ; and it slips and glides around
the room, everywhere in a ﬂash , carrying the music about ,
till you

’d
Swear the birds were back again .

”

Holy St .
B av on l

”
screeched the dame
what

’s

in the man ?

“ Comfort and joy, vr ouw :
that

’s what

’s in him !
Ask

Gretel, ask my little music-box Gretel, if your man has
lacked comfort and joy this day .

“ Not he, mother,

” laughed Gretel .
He

’s been my

music-box too .
We sang together half the time you

were gone .

”

“ Ay, so !

” said the dame, greatly relieved .
Now,

Hans, you

’ll never get through with a piece like that ;

but never mind , chick,
th ou

’

st had a long fasting .

Here, Gretel, take another slice of the sausage :
it

’ll

put blood in your cheeks .

”

“ Oh , oh , mother !

” laughed Gretel , eagerly holding

forth her platter .

“ Blood don

’t grow in girls

’ cheeks :

you mean roses .
—Isn

’t it roses, Hans ?

”

While
Hans
was
hastily
swallowing
a
mammoth

mouthful, in order to give a suitable reply to this poetic
appeal, Dame Brinker settled the matter with a quick,

339
HANS
BRINKER

Well he may, mynheer,
cried the dame ;
for only

last night we found a thousand guilders that

’s been lost

to us these ten years .

”

Dr . Bockman opened his eyes

“ Yes, mynheer,

” said Raff .
I bid the
vr ouw tell

you, though it

’s to be a secret among us ; for I see you

c an keep your lips closed as well as any man .

”

The doctor scowled .
He never liked personal remarks .

“ Now, mynheer,

” continued Raff,

“ you can take your

rightful pay .
God knows you have earned it, if bringing

such a poor tool back to the world and his family can be
called a service .
Tell the
vr ouw what

’s to pay, mynheer :

she will hand out the sum right willingly

“Tut , tut !

” said the doctor, kindly .
Say nothing

about money .
I can ﬁnd plenty of such pay any time ;

but gratitude comes seldom .
That boy

’s

‘ Thank you,

’

he added , nodding sidewise toward Hans,

“ was
pay

enough for me .

”

“ Like enough ye have a boy of your own ,
said Dame

Brinker, quite delighted to see the great man becoming
so sociable .

Dr .
Boekman

’

s good -nature vanished at once .
He

gave a growl (at least it seemed so to Gretel) , but made
no actual reply .

“ Do not think the
vr ouw meddlesome, mynheer,
said

Raff .

“ She has been sore touched of late about a lad

whose folks have gone
aw ay, none know where ;
and I

had a message for them from the young gentleman .

”

A DISCOVERY
33 1

The name was Boomph off en,
said the dame, eagerly .

Do you know aught of the family, mynheer
The doctor

’s reply w a s brief and gruff .

“ Yes .
A troublesome set .
They went , long since,

to America .

”

“ It might be, Raff ,
persisted Dame Brinker, timidly,

that the
meester
knows somebody in that country ;

though I

’m told they are mostly savages over there .
If

he could get the watch to the B oomph off ens with the
poor lad

’s message, it would be a most blessed thing .

”

“ Tut,
vr ouw !
Why pester the good meester , and dying

men and women wanting him everywhere ?
How do ye

know ye have the true name ?

”

“ I

’m sure of it I

” she replied .
They had a son Lam

bert ; and there

’s an L for Lambert, and a B for B oomp

hoffen, on the back ; though , to be sure, there

’s an odd

J too ; but the meester can look for himself.

”

So saying, she drew forth the watch .

L .
J

.
B . I

” cried
Dr .
Bockman , springing toward

her .

Why attempt to describe the scene that followed ?

I need only say that the lad

’s message was delivered to

his father at last,

— delivered while the great surgeon was

sobbing like a little child .

“ Laurens, my Laurens I

” he cried , gazing with yearn

ing eyes at the watch as he held it tenderly in his palm .

“Ah , if I had but known sooner !
Laurens a homeless

wanderer ?
Great Heaven ! he may be suffering, dying,

332
HANS
BRINKER

at this moment !
Think, man , where is he ?
Where did

my boy say the letter must be sent ?

”

Raff
Shook his head sadly .

“Think !

” implored the doctor .
Surely the memory

so lately awakened through his aid could not refuse to
serve him in a moment like this .

“ It is all gone, mynheer,

” sighed Raff .

Hans, forgetting distinctions of rank and
Station , for

getting everything but that his good friend was in trouble,
threw his arms around the doctor

’s neck .

“ I
can ﬁnd your son , mynheer .
If alive, he is
s ome

wher e.
The earth is not so very large :
I will devote

every day of my life to the search .
Mother can spare

me now .
You are rich , mynheer :
send me where you

will .

”

Gretel began to cry

.
It wa s right for Hans to go ; but

how could they ever live without him ?

Dr .
Boekm an made no reply, neither did he push

Hans away .
His eyes were ﬁxed anxiously upon Raff

Brinker .
Suddenly he lifted the watch , and with trem

bling eagerness attempted to open it .
Its stiffened spring

yielded at last : the case ﬂew
Open, disclosing a watch

paper in the back bearing a group of blue forget-me
nots .
Raff, seeing a shade of intense disappointment

pass over the doctor

’s face, hastened to say,

“There w as something else in it,

'
mynh eer ;
but the

young gentleman tore it out before he h anded it to me .

I saw him kiss it as he put it away .

334
HANS
BRINKER

a fool,
Sitting stubbornly at home, thinking he had

abandoned me .
I never dreamed , Brinker, that the boy

had discovered the mistake .
I believed it was youthful

folly, ingratitude, love of adventure, that sent him away .
My poor, poor Laurens I

”

But you know all now, mynheer,
whispered Hans .

You know he was innocent of wrong, that he loved

you and his dead mother .
We will find him .
You Shall

see him again , dear meester
.

“ God bless you I

” said Dr . Boekm an, seizing the boy

’s

hand ;
it may be as you say .
I shall try , I shall try

and , Brinker, if ever the faintest gleam of recollection
concerning him should come to you, you will send me
word at once ?

”

“ Indeed
we will !

” cried all but Hans , whose silent

promise would have satisﬁed the doctor, even had the
others not spoken .

“ Your boy

’s eyes ,
he said , turning to Dame Brinker,

are strangely like my son

’s .
The ﬁrst time I met him,

it seemed that Laurens himself w a s looking at me .

”

“ Ay, mynheer,

” replied the mother, proudly .

“ I have

marked that you were much drawn to the child .

For a few moments the meester seemed lost in thought ;

then , arousing himself, he spoke in a new voice,

“ Forgive me, Raff Brinker, for this tumult .
Do not

feel distressed on my account .
I leave your house to

day a happier man than I have been for many a long
year .
Shall I take the watch ?

”

A DISCOVERY
335

Certainly you must, mynheer .
It
w as your son

’s

wish .

”

“ Even so,
responded the doctor, regarding his trea

sure with a queer frown ; for his face could not throw off
its bad habits in an hour,

“ even so .
And now I must

be gone .
No medicine is needed by my patient, only

peace and cheerfulness ;
and both are here in plenty .

Heaven bless you, my good friends !
I shall ever be

grateful to you .

”

“ May Heaven bless you , too , mynheer ! and may you

soon ﬁnd the dear young gentleman I

” said Dame Brinker,

earnestly , after hurriedly wiping her eyes upon the corner
of her apron .

Raff uttered a hearty
Amen I

” and Gretel threw such

a wistful , eager glance at the doctor that he patted her
head as he turned to leave the cottage .

Hans went out also .

“ When I
can serve you , mynheer, I am ready .

Very well, boy ,

’ replied Dr . Bockman , with peculiar

mildness .

“ Tell them within to say nothing of what has

j ust passed .
Meantime, Hans , when you are with your

father, watch his mood .
You have tact .
At any mo

ment he may suddenly be able to tell us more .

“ Trust me for that , mynheer .

”

Good-day, my boy !

” cried the doctor, as he sprang

into his
Stately coach .

“Ah a I

” thought Hans, as it rolled away,
the meester

has more life in him than I thought .

”

XLIV

THE
RACE

THE
20th of December came at last, bringing with it

the perfection of winter weather .
All over the level land

scape lay the warm sunlight .
It tried its power on lake,

canal and river ; but the ice ﬂashed deﬁance, and showed
no
Sign of melting .
The very weather-cocks stood still

to enjoy the sight .
This gave the Windmills a holiday .

Nearly all the past week they had been whirling briskly
now, being rather out of breath , they rocked lazily in
the clear, still air .
Catch a windmill working when the

weather-cocks have nothing to do !

There w a s an end to grinding, crushing and sawing

for that day .
It was a good thing for the millers near

Broek .
Long before noon , they concluded to take in

their sails, and go to the race .
Everybody would be

there .
Already the north side of the frozen Y w a s bor

dered with eager spectators : the news

_of the great skat

ing-match had travelled far and wide .
Men , women and

children , in holiday attire, were ﬂocking toward the spot .

338
HANS BRINKER

costume,

-Shy young rustics in brazen buckles ;
simple

village-maidens concealing their ﬂaxen hair under ﬁllets
of gold ; women whose long, narrow aprons were stiff
with embroidery ;
women with short
corkscrew curls

hanging over their foreheads ;
women with shaved heads

and close-ﬁtting caps ;
and women in striped skirts and

windmill bonnets ; men in leather, in homespun, in
v el

v et and broadcloth ; burghers in model European attire,
and burghers in short jackets , wide trousers, and steeple
crowned hats .

There were beautiful Friesland girls in wooden shoes

and coarse petticoats , with solid gold crescents encircling
their heads, ﬁnished at each temple with a golden rosette,
and hung with lace a century old .
Some wore necklaces ,

pendants and earrings of the purest gold .
Many were

content with gilt, or even with brass ; but it is not an
uncommon thing for a Friesland woman to have all the
family treasure in her head -gear .
More than one rustic

lass displayed the value of two thousand guilders upon
her head that day .

Scattered throughout the crowd were peasants from

the Island of Marken , with sabots, black stockings, and
the widest of breeches ; also women from Marken , with
short blue petticoats, and black jackets gayly ﬁgured
in front .
They wore red sleeves, white aprons, and a cap

like a bishop

’s mitre over their golden hair .

The children , often , were as quaint and odd-looking

as their elders .
In short , one-third of the crowd seemed

THE RACE
339

to
have
stepped
bodily
from
a
collection
of Dutch

paintings .

Everywhere could be seen tall women and
Stumpy

men, lively-faced
girls,
and youths whose expression

never changed from sunrise to sunset .

There seemed to be at least one specimen from every

known town in Holland .
There were Utrecht water

bearers, Gouda cheese-makers, Delft pottery-men , Schie
dam distillers, Amsterdam diamond-cutters , Rotterdam
merchants , dried-up
herring-packers, and two sleepy

eyed shepherds from Texel .
Every man of them had

his pipe and tobacco-pouch .
Some carried what might

be called the smoker

’s complete
o utﬁt,

-a pipe, tobacco,

a pricker with which to clean the tube, a silver net for
protecting the bowl, and a box of the strongest of brim
stone matches .

A true Dutchman , you
must
remember,
is
rarely

without his pipe on any possible occasion .
He may, for

a moment , neglect to breathe ; but when the pipe is for
gotten, he must be dying, indeed .
There were no such

sad cases here .
Wreaths of smoke were rising from every

possible quarter .
The more fantastic the smoke-wreath ,

the more placid and solemn the smoker .

Look at those boys and girls on stilts !
That is a good

idea .
They can see over the heads of the tallest .
It is

strange to see those little bodies high in the air, carried
about
on mysterious legs .
They have such a resolute

look on their round faces , what wonder that nervous old

340
HANS
BRINKER

gentlemen , with tender feet, wince and tremble while
the long-legged little monsters stride past them !

You will read , in certain books , that the Dutch are a

quiet people : so they are generally .
But listen ! did ever

you hear such a din ?
All made up of human voices

no, the horses are helping somewhat, and the ﬁddles are
squeaking pitifully ;
(how it must pain
ﬁddles to be

tuned I) but the mass of the sound comes from the great

vox huma na that belongs to a crowd .

That queer little dwarf, going about with a heavy

basket, winding in and out among the people, helps not
a little .
You can hear his shrill cry above all other sounds ,

“ Pypen en tabac !
Pypen
en tabac I

”

Another, his big brother, though evidently some years

younger, is selling doughnuts and bonbons .
He is call

ing on all pretty children , far and near, to come quickly,
or the cakes will be gone .

You know quite
a
number among the spectators .

High up in yonder pavilion, erected upon the border of
the ice, are some persons whom you have seen very lately .
In the centre is Madame van Gleck .
It is her birthday,

you remember :
she has the post of honor .
There is

Mynheer van Gleck, whose meerschaum has not really
grown fast to his lips :
it only appears so .
There are

grandfather and grandmother, whom you met at the St .
Nicholas f2te.
All the children are with them .
It is so

mild , they have brought even the baby .
The poor little

creature is swaddled very much after the manner of an

342
HANS
BRINKER

The one with the blue ﬂags contains the musicians .

Those pagoda-like affairs , decked with sea-shells, and
streamers of every possible hue, are the judges

’ stands ;

and those columns and ﬂagstaffs upon the ice mark the
limit of the race-course .
The two white columns , twined

with green, connected at the top by that long, ﬂoating
strip of drapery, form the starting-point .
Those ﬂag

staffs, half a mile
off , stand at each end of the boundary

line, cut sufficiently deep to be distinct to the skaters,
though not deep enough to trip them when they turn
to come back to the starting-point .

The air is so clear, it seems scarcely possible that the

columns and ﬂagstaffs are so far apart .
Of course, the

judges

’ stands are but little nearer together .

Half a mile on the ice, when the atmosphere is like

this, is but a short distance, after all, especially when
fenced with a living chain of spectators .

The music has commenced .
How melody seems to

enjoy itself in the open air !
The ﬁddles have forgotten

their agony, and everything is harmonious .
Until you

look at the blue tent, it seems that the music springs
from the sunshine, it is so boundless, so joyous .
Only

the musicians are solemn .

Where are the racers ?
All assembled together near

the white columns .
It is a beautiful sight,

— forty boys

and girls in picturesque attire, darting with
electric

swiftness in and out among each other, or sailing in pairs
and
triplets ,
beckoning,
chatting, whispering,
in
the

fulness of youthful glee .

THE RACE
343

A few careful ones are soberly tightening their straps ;

others, halting on one leg, with ﬂushed , eager faces, sud

d enly cross the suspected skate over their knee, give it
an examining shake, and dart
off again .
One and all

are possessed with
th e spirit of motion .
They cannot

Stand still .
Their
Skates are a part of them ; and every

runner seems bewitched .

Holland is the place for skaters, after all .
Where else

can nearly every boy and girl perform feats on the ice
that would attract a crowd if seen in Central Park ?
Look at Ben !
I did not see him before .
He is really

astonishing the natives ;
no easy thing to do in
th e

Netherlands .
Save your strength , Ben, you will need

it soon .
Now other boys are trying !
Ben is surpassed

already .
Such jumping, such poising, such spinning,

such india-rubber exploits generally !
That boy with

a red
cap is the lion now : his back is a watch-spring, his

body is cork— no, it is iron, or it would snap at that .
He is a bird , a top , a rabbit, a corkscrew, a sprite, a ﬂesh
ball, all in an instant .
When you think he

’s erect , he is

down ;
and when you think he is down , he is up .
He

drops his glove on the ice, and turns a somerset as he
picks it up .
Without stopping, he snatches the
cap from

Jacob Poot

’s astonished head , and claps it b ack again

“ hind side
before .

”
Lookers-on
hurrah
and
laugh .

Foolish boy !
It is arctic weather under your feet, but

more than temperate overhead .
Big drops already are

rolling down your forehead .
Superb skater as you are,

you may lose the race .

344
HANS
BRINKER

A French traveller,
Standing with a note-book in his

hand , sees our English friend , Ben , buy a doughnut of
the dwarf

’

S brother, and eat it .
Thereupon he writes

in his note-book that the Dutch take enormous mouth
fuls, and
universally are fond of potatoes boiled
in

molasses .

There are some familiar faces near the white columns .

Lambert , Ludwig, Peter and Carl are all there, cool ,
and in good skating-order .
Hans is not far
off .
Evi

d ently he is going to join in the race, for his
Skates are

on,

-the very pair that he sold for seven guilders .
He

had soon suspected that his fairy godmother w a s the
mysterious

“ friend

”
who bought them .
This settled ,

he had boldly charged her with the deed ; and she, know
ing well that all her little savings had been spent in the
purchase, had not had the face to deny it .
Through the

fairy godmother, too, he had been rendered amply able
to buy them back again .
Therefore Hans is to be in

the race .
Car! is more indignant than ever about it ;

but, as three other peasant-boys have entered , Hans is
not alone .

Twenty boys and twenty girls .
The latter, by this

time, are standing in front, braced for the start ;
for

they are to have the ﬁrst

“ run .

”
Hilda , Rychie and

Katrinka are among them .
Two or three bend hastily

to give a last pull at their skate-straps .
It is pretty to

see them stamp to be sure that all is ﬁrm .
Hilda is

speaking pleasantly to a graceful little creature in a red

346
HANS
BRINKER

Off again .
No mistake this time .
Whew ! how fast

they go !

The multitude is quiet for an instant, absorbed in

eager, breathless watching .

Cheers spring up along the line of Spectators .
Huzza !

ﬁve girls are ahead .
Who comes ﬂying back from the

boundary-mark ?
We cannot tell .
Something red , that

is all .
There is a blue spot ﬂitting near it, and a dash of

yellow nearer still .
Spectators at this end of the line

strain their eyes, and wish they had taken their post
nearer the ﬂagstaff .

The wave of cheers is coming back again .
Now we

c an see .
Katrinka is ahead !

She passes the Van Holp pavilion .
The next is Ma

dame van Gleck

’

s .
That leaning ﬁgure gazing from it

is a magnet .
Hilda shoots past Katrinka , waving h er

hand to her mother as
Sh e passes .
Two others are close

now, whizzing on like arrows .
What is that ﬂash of red

and gray ?
Hurrah , it is Gretel !
She, too, waves her

hand , but toward no gay pavilion .
The crowd is cheer

ing ; but
Sh e hears only her father

’s voice,

-“ Well done,

little Gretel !

”
Soon Katrinka , with a quick, merry

laugh
Shoots past Hilda .
The girl in yellow is gaining

now .
She passes them all,

—
all except Gretel .
The

judges lean forward without seeming to lift their eyes
from their watches .
Cheer after cheer ﬁlls the air : the

very columns seem rocking .
Gretel has passed them .

She has w on .

THE RACE
347

GRETEL BRINKER,
O N E MILE I

” shouts the crier .

The judges nod .
They write something upon a tablet

which each holds in his hand .

While the girls are resting,

—some crowding eagerly

around our frightened little Gretel , some standing aside
in high disdain ,

-the boys form in a line .

Mynheer van Gleck drops the handkerchief, this time .

The buglers give a Vigorous blast s

— Off
Start the boys !

Half-way already .
Did ever you see the like !

Three hundred legs ﬂa shings by in an instant .
But

there are only twenty boys .
No matter :
there were

hundreds of legs , I am sure .
Where are they now
There

is such a noise , one gets bewildered .
What are the people

laughing at ?
Oh ! at that fat boy in the rear .
See him

go !
See him !
He

’ll be down in an instant :
no, he

won

’t .
I wonder if he knows he is all alone : the other

boys are nearly at th e boundary-line .
Yes , he knows it .

He stops .
He wipes his hot face .
He takes
off his
cap ,

and looks about him .
Better to give up with a good

grace .
He has made a hundred friends by that hearty,

astonished laugh .
Good Jacob Poot I

The ﬁne fellow is already among the spectators, gazing

as eagerly as the rest .

A cloud of feathery ice ﬂies from the heels of the skaters

as they

“ bring to,

” and turn at the ﬂagstaff s .

Something black is coming now, one of the boys :
it

is all w e know .
He has touched the
vox huma na stop of

the crowd : it fairly roars .
Now they come nearer ; we

348
HANS
BRINKER

can see the red cap .
There

’s Ben, there

’s Peter, there

’s

Hans .

Hans is ahead .
Young Madame van
Gend almost

crushes the ﬂowers in her hand :
Sh e had been quite sure

that Peter would be ﬁrst .
Carl Schummel is next , then

Ben , and the youth with the red
c ap

.
The others are

pressing close .
A tall ﬁgure darts from among them .

He passes the red
cap , he passes Ben, then Carl .
Now it

is an even race between him and Hans .
Madame van

Gend catches her breath .

It is Peter !
He is ahead !
Hans shoots past him .

Hilda

’s eyes ﬁll with tears :
Peter must beat .
Annie

’s

eyes ﬂash proudly .
Gretel gazes with clasped hands

four
Strokes more will take her brother to the columns .

He is there !
Yes ; but so was young Schummel just

a second before .
At the last instant , Carl , gathering his

powers , had whizzed between them, and passed the goal .

“ CARL SCHUMMEL,
O N E MILE I

” shouts the crier .

Soon Madame van
Gleck rises again .
The falling

handkerchief
Starts the bugle ;
and the bugle, using its

voice as a bowstring, Shoots off twenty girls like so many
arrows .

It is a beautiful sight ; but one has not long to look

before we
can fairly distinguish them , they are far in

th e distance .
This time they are close upon one
a n
.

other .
It is hard to say, as they come speeding back

from the ﬂagstaff, which will reach the columns ﬁrst .
There are new faces among the foremost,

—
eager, glow

350
HANS BRINKER

Hilda, Annie and Gretel, seated upon the long crimson

bench ,
can remain quiet no longer .
They spring to their

feet, so different ! and yet one in eagerness .
Hilda in

stantly reseats herself :
none shall know how interested

Sh e is ; none shall know how anxious , how ﬁlled with one
hope .
Shut your eyes , then , Hilda , hide your face rip

pling with joy .
Peter has beaten .

“ PETER VAN HOLP , O N E MILE I

” calls the crier .

The same buzz of excitement as before, while the

judges take notes, the same throbbing of music through
the din ;
but something is different .
A little crowd

presses close about some object near the column .
Carl

has fallen .
He is not hurt , though somewhat stunned .

If he were less sullen, he would ﬁnd more sympathy in
these warm young hearts .
As it is , they forget him as

soon as he is fairly on his feet again .

The girls are to skate their third mile .
How resolute the little maidens look as they stand in

a line !
Some are solemn with a sense of responsibility ;

some wear a smile, half-bashful, half-provoked ; but one
air of determination pervades them all .

This third mile may decide the race .
Still, if neither

Gretel nor Hilda win, there is yet a chance among the
rest for the
Silver skates .

Each girl feels sure that, this time, Sh e will accomplish

the distance in one-half the time .
How they
Stamp to

try their runners !
How nervously they examine each

Strap !
How erect they stand at last, every eye upon

THE RACE
35 1

The bugle thrills through them again .
With quiver

ing eagerness they spring forward , bending, but in perfect
balance .
Each ﬂashing stroke seems longer than the

last .

Now they are skimming
off in the distance .

Again the eager straining of eyes ;
again the
Shouts

and cheering ; again the thrill of excitement, as , after a
few moments, four or ﬁve, in advance of the rest, come

sp eeding

x b ack, nearer, nearer, to the white columns .

Who is ﬁrst ?
Not
Rychie,
Katrinka , Annie,
nor

Hilda , nor the girl in yellow, but Gretel,

—Gretel , the

ﬂeetest sprite of a girl that ever skated .
She was but

playing in the earlier race :
now she is in earnest, or,

ra ther, something within her has determined to win .
That lithe little form makes no effort ;
but it cannot

Stop ,

-no t until the goal is passed !

In vain the crier lifts his voice :
he cannot be heard .

He has no news to tell : it is already ringing through the
crowd,

—Gr etel has won the silver
skates !

Like a bird , she has ﬂown over the ice ;
like a bird ,

she looks about her in a timid , startled w ay

.
She longs

to dart to the sheltered nook where her father and mother
stand .
But Hans is beside her : the girls are crowding

round .
Hilda

’s kind , joyous voice breathes in her ear .

From that hour, none will despise her .
Goose-girl or

not, Gretel stands acknowledged Queen of the Skaters .

With natural pride, Hans turns to see if Peter van

Holp is witnessing his
Sister

’s triumph .
Peter is not

352
HANS
BRINKER

looking toward them at all

‘

.
He is kneeling, bending

his troubled face low, and working hastily at his skate

Strap .
Hans is beside him at once .

“Are you in trouble, mynheer

Ah , Hans ! that you ?
Yes , my fun is over .
I tried

to tighten my strap , to make a new hole ; and this bother
ation of a knife has cut it nearly in two .

”

“ Mynheer,

” said Hans, at
th e same time pulling
off

a
Skate,

“ you must use my strap I

”

“ Not I , indeed , Hans Brinker !
cried Peter, looking

up ,

“ though I thank you warmly .
Go to your post, my

friend : the bugle will sound in a minute .

”

“ Mynheer,

” pleaded Hans, in a husky voice,
you

have called me your friend .
Take this Strap— quick !

There is not an instant to lose .
I shall not skate this

time : indeed , I am out of practice .
Mynheer, you must

take it ;

” and Hans, blind and deaf to any remonstrance,

Slipped his strap into Peter

’s skate, and implored him to

put it on .

“ Come, Peter !

” cried Lambert from the line

are waiting for you .

”

“ For madame

’s sake,
pleaded Hans,
be quick !
She

is motioning to you to join the racers .
There, the
skate

is almost on :
quick, mynheer, fasten it .
I could not

p ossibly

i
win .
The race lies between Master Schummel

and yourself.

You are a noble fellow, Hans !

” cried Peter, yield

ing at last .
He sprang to his post just as the h andker

354
HANS
BRINKER

up a lively air, then a tremendous march .
The
sp ecta

tors , thinking something new
w as about to happen ,

deigned to listen and to look .

The racers formed in
Single ﬁle .
Peter, being tallest ,

Stood ﬁrst .
Gretel, the smallest of all, took her place at

the end .
Hans,
who had borrowed a
Strap from the

cake-boy, w a s near the head .
I Three gayly twined arches were placed at intervals
upon the river, facing the Van Gleck pavilion .

Skating Slowly, and in perfect time to the music, the

boys and girls moved forward , led on by Peter .
It w a s

beautiful to see the bright procession glide along like a
living creature .
It curved and doubled , and drew its

graceful length in and out among the arches : whichever

w ay Peter, the head , went , the body was sure to follow .
Sometimes it steered direct for the centre arch ;
then ,

as if seized with a new impulse, turned away, and curled
itself about the ﬁrst one ;
then unwound slowly, and

bending low, with quick, snake-like
cu r v ings, crossed

the river, passing at length through the farthest arch .

When the music w a s slow, the procession seemed to

crawl like a thing afraid ; it grew livelier, and the crea
ture darted forward with a spring , gliding rapidly among
the arches , in and out , curling, twisting, turning, never
losing form , until, at the shrill call of the bugle rising
above the music, it suddenly resolved itself into boys
and girls standing in double semicircle before Madame
van Gleck

’

s pavilion .

THE
RACE
355

Peter and Gretel stand in the centre, in advance of

the
others .
Madame
v a n
Gleck
rises
majestically .

Gretel trembles , b utfeels that Shemust look at the beau
tiful lady .
She cannot hear what is said , there is such

a buzzing all around her .
She is thinking that she ought

to try and make a courtesy, such as her mother makes
to the meester , when suddenly something
SO dazzling is

placed in her hand that she gives a cry of joy .

Then she ventures to look about her .
Peter, too , has

something in his hands .

“ Oh ,
oh I how splendid I

” she

cries ;
and

“ Oh ! how splendid !
is echoed as far as

people
can see .

Meantime the
silver
Skates
ﬂash
in the
sunshine,

throwing dashes of light upon those two happy faces .

M ev r ouw van Gend sends a little messenger with her

bouquets ,

— one for Hilda , one for Carl, and others for

Peter and Gretel .

At
Sight of the ﬂowers , the Queen of the Skaters b e

comes uncontrollable .
With
a bright stare of gratitude,

she gathers
Skates and bouquet in her apron , hugs them

to her bosom, and darts
off to search for her father and

mother in the scattering crowd .

XLV

JOY IN THE COTTAGE

PERHAPS you were surprised to learn that Raff and

his
vr ouw were at the
Skating-race :
you would have

been more so, had you been with them on the evening
of that merry
20th of December .
To see the Brinker

cottage standing sulkily alone on the frozen marsh , with
its bulgy, rheumatic-looking walls, and its slouched hat
of a roof pulled far over its eyes, one would never suspect
that a lively scene was passing within .
Without, nothing

w a s left of the day but a low line of blaze at the horizon .
A few venturesome clouds had already taken ﬁre ;
and

others, with their edges burning, were lost in the gather
ing smoke .

A stray gleam of sunshine, slipping down from the

willow-stump , crept stealthily under the cottage .
It

seemed to feel that the inmates would give it welcome,
if it could only get near them .
The room under which

it hid w a s as clean as clean could be .
The very cracks

in the rafters were polished .
Delicious odors ﬁlled the

358
HANS BRINKER

so happy and proud that she would scarce have been sur
prised
at a visit from the king himself.

“ Good-evening,
j ufvr ouw!

”
said
the
trio, making

magniﬁcent bows .

“ Dear me !

” thought Dame Brinker as she bobbed

up and down like a churn-dasher :

“ it

’s lucky I learned

to courtesy at Heidelberg !

Raff w a s content to return the boys

’ salutations with

a respectful nod .

“ Pray be seated , young masters ,
said the dame, as

Gretel bashfully thrust a stool toward them .

“ There

’s

a lack of chairs , as you see : but this one by the ﬁre is
at your service ;
and , if you don

’t mind the hardness ,

that oak chest is as good a seat as the best .
— That

’s

right, Hans , pull it out .

”

By the time the boys were seated to the dame

’s satis

faction , Peter, acting as
Spokesman, had explained that

they were going to attend a lecture at Amsterdam, and
had stopped on the way to return Hans

’ strap

Oh , mynheer !

” cried Hans , earnestly .
It is too

much trouble .
I am very sorry .

”

“ No trouble at all, Hans .
I could have waited for

you to come to your work to-morrow, had I not wished
to call .
And , Hans, talking of your work, my father is

much pleased with it .
A carver by trade could not have

done it better .
He would like to have the south arbor

ornamented also ;
but I told him you were going to

school again .

”

JOY
IN THE COTTAGE
359

Ay !
put in
Raff
Brinker,
emphatically,
Hans

must go to school at once, and Gretel as well : that is
true .

”

“ I am glad to hear you say so,
responded Peter,

turning toward the father,

“ and very glad to know that

you are again a well man .

”

“ Yes , young master, a well man, and able to work as

steady as ever, thank God I

”

!Here Hans hastily wrote something on
th e edge of a

time-worn almanac that hung by the chimney-place !

“ Ay, that

’s right, lad , set it down .
Figgs— Wiggs

alack, alack !

” added Raff, in great dismay,

“ it

’s gone

again !

”

“ All right, father,
said Hans ,
the name

’s down now

in black and white .
Here, look at it, father :
mayhap

the rest will come to you .
If w e had the place as well,

it would be complete .
Then, turning to Peter, he said

in a low tone,

“ I have an important errand in town,

mynheer ; and if

“ Wist !

”
exclaimed the
dame, lifting her hands ,

not to Amsterdam to-night, and you

’ve owned your

legs were aching under you .
Nay, nay, it

’ll be soon

enough to go at early daylight .

“ Daylight, indeed I

” echoed Raff .
That would never

do .
Nay, M eitj e, he must go this hour .

”

The
vr ouw looked for an instant as if Raff

’s recovery

w as becoming rather a doubtful beneﬁt :
her word was

no longer sole law in the house .
Fortunately the proverb ,

369
HANS
BRINKER

Humble Wife is husband

’s boss,
had taken deep root

in her mind : even as the dame pondered , it bloomed .

“ Very well, Raff ,

” she said smilingly,

“ it is thy boy

as well as mine .
Ah !
I

’ve a troublesome house, young

masters .

”

Just then Peter drew a long strap from his pocket .
Handing it to Hans, he said in an
undertone,
I

need not thank you for lending me this , Hans Brinker .
Such boys as you do not ask for thanks ;
but I must

say you did me a great kindness, and I am proud to
acknowledge it .
I did not know,

” he added laughingly,

“ until fairly in the race, how anxious I w a s to win .

”

Hans was glad to join in Peter

’s laugh : it covered his

embarrassment , and gave his face a chance to cool
off

a little .
Honest, generous boys like Hans have such a

stupid w ay of blushing when you least expect it .

“ It
w as nothing, mynheer,

” said the dame, hasten

ing to her son

’s relief.
The lad

’s whole soul was in

having you Win the race : I know it was .

”

This helped matters beautifully .

“Ah , mynheer !

” Hans hurried to say,
from the ﬁrst

start I felt
Stiff and
Strange on my feet .
I w as well out

of it, so long as I had no chance of winning .

”

Peter looked rather distressed .

We may hold different opinions there .
That part of

the business troubles me .
It is too late to mend it
now ;

but it would be really a kindness to me if

The rest of Peter

tiful .
FOR THE FLEETEST was written upon the cover in

sparkling letters .
It w a s lined with velvet ; and in one

corner w a s
Stamped the name and address of the maker .

Gretel thanked Peter in her own simple w ay ;
then

being quite delighted and confused , and not knowing
what else to do, lifted the case, carefully examining it
in every part .

“ It

’s made by Mynheer Birmingham,

”

she said after a while, Still blushing, and holding it b e
fore her eyes .

“ Birmingham I

” replied Lambert v an M ounen :
that

’s

the name of a place in England .
Let me see it .

“ Ha , ha I

” he laughed , holding the open case toward

the ﬁ r elight,
no wonder you thought so .
But it

’s a

slight mistake .
The case was made at Birmingham ;

but the maker

’s name is in smaller letters .
Humph !

they

’re so small I can

’t read them .

”

“ Let me try,
said Peter, leaning over his shoulder .

Why, man , it

’s perfectly distinct .
It

’s T

—
H— it

’s T

Well,

”
exclaimed Lambert , triumphantly,

“ if you

can read it so easily, let

’s hear it .
T

—
H, what ?

”

“ T, H

— T, H .
Oh ! why, Thomas Higgs, to be sure,

replied Peter, pleased to be able to decipher it
at last .

Then, feeling they had been behaving rather
uncer e

moniously, he turned toward Hans .

Peter turned pale .
What
w a s the matter with the

people ?
Raff and Hans had started up , and were star

ing at him in glad amazement .
Gretel looked wild .
Dame

363

Brinker, with an unlighted candle in her hand , wa s rush
ing about the room, crying,

“ Hans , Hans ! where

’s your

hat ?
Oh , the meester ! oh , the meester !

”

“ Birmingham ! Higgs !

” exclaimed Hans .
Did you

say Higgs ?
We

’ve found him !
I must be

You see, young masters ,

” panted the dame, at the

same time snatching Hans

’ hat from the bed ,

“ you

He

’t—
I mean— oh ,

Hans , you must go to Amsterdam this minute I

”

“ Good-night, mynheers !

” panted Hans, radiant with

sudden joy,

—
“ good -night !
You will excuse me, I must

go .
Birmingham

— Higgs

— Higgs

—
Birmingh am I

”
And ,

s eizing his hat from his mother, and his skates from Gretel,
he rushed from the cottage .

What could the boys think, but that the entire Brinker

family had gone suddenly crazy ?

They bade an embarrassed

“ good-evening,
and turned

to go .
But Raﬁ stopped them .

“This Thomas Higgs , young masters, is
a

—
a person .

Ah I

” exclaimed Peter, quite sure that Raﬁ w a s the

most crazy of all .

“ Yes , a person

—
a—
ah em I

—
a friend .
We thought

him dead .
I hope it is the same man .
In England , did

you say ?

“ Yes, Birmingham ,
answered Peter
it must be

Birmingham in England .

”

“ I know the man ,

” said Ben , addressing Lambert .

His factory is not four miles from our place .
A queer

fellow, still as an oyster .
Don

’t seem at all like an Eng

lishman .
I

-a solemn-looking chap,

with magniﬁcent eyes .
He made a beautiful writing

case once for me to give Jenny on her birthday .
Makes

pocket-books , telescope-cases, and all kinds of leather
work .

”

As this was said in English , Van M ounen, of course,

translated it for the beneﬁt of all concerned , noticing
meanwhile that neither Raff nor his
vr ouw looked very

miserable, though Raff
w a s trembling, and the dame

’s

eyes were swimming with tears .

You may believe the doctor heard every word of the

story, when , later in the evening, he came driving back
with Hans
The three young gentlemen had been gone

some time,
Dame Brinker said ;

“ but like enough , by

hurrying, it would be easy to ﬁnd them coming out from
the lecture, wherever that w a s .

”

“True,

” said Raﬁ , nodding his head :
the

It would be well to see

the young English gentleman, mynheer, before he for
gets all about Thomas Higgs .
It

Slippery name, d

One can

Strong as a pile-driver, and my boy writ it

Ay, mynheer, I

lad .
He

Dame Brinker, raising her hands eagerly, took up the

thread of the discourse .

XLVI

THE MYSTERY OF THOMAS HIGGS

HIGGS

’ factory was a mine of delight for the gossip s

of Birmingham .
It
was a small building, but quite

large enough to hold a mystery .
Who the proprietor

was, or where he came from, none could tell .
He looked

like a gentleman, that was certain, though everybody
knew he had risen from an apprenticeship ; and he could
handle his pen like a writing-master .

Years ago he had suddenly appeared in the place, a

lad of eighteen ;
learned his trade faithfully, and risen

in the conﬁdence of his employer ;
been taken in as a

partner soon after his time was up ;
and ﬁnally, when

old Willett died , had assumed the business on his
own

account .
This w as all that was known of his affairs .

It w as a common remark among some of the good

people that he never had a word to say to a Christian

soul ; while others declared , that though he spoke beau
tiful , when he chose to, there w as something wrong in
his accent .
A tidy man, too, they called him, all but for

THE MYSTERY
OF THOMAS HIGGS
367

having that scandalous green pond alongside of his fac
tory, which wasn

’t deep enough for an eel, and was

“just a fever-nest, as sure as you live .

His nationality was a great puzzle .
The English name

spoke plain enough for one side of his house ; but of what
manner of nation was his mother ?
If
She

’d been an

American, he

’d certain have had high cheek-bones and

reddish skin ;
if a German , he would have known the

language, and Squire Smith declared he didn

’t ; if French

(and his having that frog-pond made it seem likely) , it
would come out in his speech .
No, there was nothing

he could be but Dutch .
And ,
Strangest of all, though

the man always pricked up his ears when you talked of
Holland , he didn

’t seem to know the ﬁrst thing about

the country when you put him to the point .

Anyhow, as no letters ever came to him from his

mother

’s family in Holland , and as nobody living had

ever seen old Higgs, the family couldn

’t be anything

much .
Probably Thomas Higgs himself w a s no better

than he
Should be, for all he pretended to carry himself

so
Straight ;
and , for their parts, the gossips declared ,

they were not going
to
tr ouble their heads about him .

Consequently Thomas Higgs and his affairs were never
failing subjects of discussion .

Picture, then, the consternation among all the good

people, when it was announced by

“ somebody who w a s

there, and ought to know,

” that the post-boy had that

very morning handed Higgs a
foreign-looking letter ;

368
HANS
BRINKER

and the man had
turned as white as the wall, rushed

to his factory, talked a bit with one of the head-workmen ,
and , without bidding a creature good-bye, was
off bag

and baggage before you could wink, ma

’am .

”
Mistress

Scrubbs, his landlady, was in deep afﬂiction .
The dear

soul became quite out of breath while speaking of him .

“ To leave lodgin

’

s in that
sudd ent w ay, without never

so much as a day

’s warnin

’

, which w a s what every woman

who didn

’t wish to be trodden under foot (which , thank

HeV V i ng ! wasn

’t her w ay) had a perfect right to expect,

— yes, and a week

’

, now you mention it ;
and

without even so much as sayin

,

‘ Many thanks to you,

Mistress Scrubbs, for all past kindnesses,

most numerous, though she said it, wh o shouldn

’t say

—
leastwise

It was really scander

lous, though , to be sure, Mister

to the last fa r thin

’

; and it fairly brought tears to her eyes

to see his dear empty boots lyin

’ there in the corner of

his room, which alone showed trouble of mind ;
for he

always stood

’em up
a str aigh t as
solger s, though , bein

’

half-soled
twice, they hadn

’t, of course,
been worth

takin

’ away .

”

Whereupon her dearest friend , Miss Scr umpkins, ran

home to tell all about it .
And , as everybody knew the

Scr umpkinses, a
shining gossamer of news
w a s soon

woven from one end of the
Street to the other .

An investigating committee met th at evening at Mrs .

XLVII

BROAD SUNSHINE

ONE snowy day in January, Laurens Bockman went

with his
father
to
pay
his
respects to the Brinker

family .

Raﬁ w a s resting after the labors of the day .
Gretel,

having ﬁlled and lighted his pipe, w a s brushing every
Speck of ash from the hearth .
The dame w a s spinning ;

and Hans, perched upon a stool by the window,
w a s

diligently studying his lessons .
A peaceful, happy house

hold , whose main excitement during the past week had
been the looking forward to this possible Visit from
Thomas Higgs .

AS soon as the grand presentation
w a s over, Dame

Brinker insisted upon giving her guests some hot tea .

It w a s enough to freeze any one,
she said ,

“ to be out

in such crazy, blustering weather .

”
While they were

talking with her husband , she whispered to Gretel that
the young gentleman

’s eyes and her boy

’s were certainly

as much alike as four beans, to say nothing of a way they

37°

BROAD SUNSHINE
37 1

both had of looking as if they were stupid , and yet knew
as much as a body

’s grandfather .

Gretel was disappointed .
She had looked forward to

a tragic scene, such as Annie Bouman had often de
scribed to her from story-books ; and here was the gentle
man who came so near being a murderer, who for ten
years had been wandering over the face of the earth , wh o
had believed himself deserted and scorned by his father,
the very young gentleman who had ﬂed from his country
in such magniﬁcent trouble, sitting by the ﬁre just as
pleasant
and natural as could be !

To be sure, his voice had trembled when he talked

with her parents ; and he had met his father

’s look with

a bright kind of smile that would have suited a dragon
killer bringing the waters of perpetual youth to his king ;
but, after all, he wasn

’t at all like the conquered hero in

Annie

’s book .
He did not say, lifting his hand toward

heaven ,

“ I hereby swear to be forever faithful to my

home, my God , and my country ,

” which would have

been only right and proper under the circumstances .

All things considered , Gretel was disappointed .
Raﬁ ,

however, was perfectly satisﬁed .
The message w a s de

livered ; Dr . Bockman had his son safe and sound ; and
the poor lad had done nothing sinful, after all, except
in thinking his father would have abandoned him for
an accident .
To be sure, the graceful stripling had h e

come rather a heavy man .
Raﬁ
had
unconsciously

hoped to clasp that same boyish hand again ;
b ut all

372
HANS
BRINKER

things were changed to Raﬁ , for that matter .
So he

pushed back every feeling but joy, as he
saw father and

son sitting side by side at his hearthstone .
Meantime

Hans
wa s wholly occupied in the thought of Thomas

Higgs

’ happiness in being able to be the
meester

’
s as

sistant again ;
and Dame Brinker was sighing softly to

herself, wishing that the lad

’s mother were alive to see

him,

-such a ﬁne young gentleman as he
w a s,

— and

wondering how Dr . Bockman could bear to see the silver
watch getting so dull .
He had worn it ever since Raff

handed it over, that was evident .
What had he done

with the gold one he used to wear ?

The light w a s shining full upon Dr .
Boekman

’

s face .

How
contented
he
looked !
how
much
younger
and

brighter than
formerly !
The hard
lines were
quite

melting away .
He
was laughing, as he said to the

father,

“Am I not a happy man , Raﬁ Brinker ?
My son Will

sell out his factory this month , and open a warehouse in
Amsterdam .
I
shall have all my spectacle-cases for

nothing .

”

Hans started from his revery .
A warehouse, myn

heer !
And will Thomas Higgs—
I mean is your son not

to be your assistant again ?

”

A shade passed over the meester

’
s face ; but he bright

ened with an effort, as he replied ,

“ Oh , no ! Laurens has had quite enough of that .
He

wishes to be a merchant .

374
HANS
BRINKER

These great people, she knew well enough , never like to
hear poor folk speak up so pert .

The meester turned around .

“ How old are you, Hans Brinker ?

Fifteen, mynheer,

” w as the startled reply

Would you like to become a physician ?

Yes,
mynheer,

”
answered
Hans,
quivering
with

excitement .

“Would you be willing, With your parents

’ consent,

to devote yourself to study, to go to the University,
and , in time, be a student in my ofﬁce

YES , mynheer .

”

You would not grow restless, think you, and change

your mind just as I had set my heart upon preparing you
to be my successor ?

”

Hans

’ eyes ﬂashed .

“No , mynheer !
I would not change .

You may believe himthere
,

” cried

‘ the dame, who

could remain quiet no longer .
Hans is like a rock,

when once he decides ;
and as for study, mynheer, the

child has almost grown fast to his books , of late
.
He

can jumble
oﬁ Latin already, like any priest .

”

The doctor smiled .

“ Well, Hans, I see nothing to

prevent us from carrying out this plan, if your father
agrees .

”

“ Ahem !
said Raﬁ , too proud of his boy to be very

meek .

“The fact is , mynheer, I prefer an active, out-of

door life myself.
But if the lad

’s inclined to study for a

meester , and he

’d have the beneﬁt of your good word to

And Gretel— ah , what a vista of puzzling work sud

d enly
Opens before her !
Yes, for dear Hans

’ sake she

will
Study now .
If h e really is to be a meester , his sister

must not shame his greatness .

How faithfully those glancing eyes shall yet seek for

the jewels that lie hidden in rocky school-books !
And

how they shall yet brighten and droop at the coming of
one whom
She knows of now only as the boy wh o wore

a red cap on that wonderful day when she found
th e

silver skates in her apron !

But the doctor and Laurens are going .
Dame Brinker

CONCLUSION

OUR story is nearly told .
Time passes in Holland

just as surely and steadily as here : in that respect, no
country is odd .

To the Brinker family it has brought great changes .

Hans has spent the years faithfully and proﬁtably, con
quering obstacles as they arose, and pursuing one object
with all the energy of his nature .
If often
the way has

been rugged , his resolution has never failed .
Some

times he echoes, with his good old friend , the words
said long ago in that little cottage near Broek,

“ Surgery

is an ugly business ;
but always in his heart of hearts

lingers the echo of those truer words,

“ It is great and

noble : it awakes a reverence for God

’s work .

”

Were you in Amsterdam to-day, you might see the

famous Dr . Brinker riding in his grand coach to
Visit

his patients ;
o r , it might be, you would see him skating

with his own boys and girls upon the frozen canal .
For

Annie Bouman , the beautiful, frank-hearted peasant
girl, you would inquire in vain : but Annie Brinker, the

vr ouw of the great physician, is very like her;
only, as

Hans says, she is even lovelier, wiser, more like a fairy
godmother, than ever .

Peter van Holp, also, is a married man .
I could have

told you before that he and Hilda would join hands, and
glide through life together, just as, years
ago, they

skimmed side by side over the frozen , sunlit river .

Katrinka is not quite so merry as formerly ;
and , I

grieve to say, some of the tinkling bells are out of tune .
But
Sh e is the life of her social circle still .
I wish she

would be in earnest, just for a little while ;
but no, it

is not her nature .
Her cares and sorrows do nothing

more than disturb the tinkling :
they never waken any

deeper music .

Rychie

’

s soul has been
Stirred to its depths during

these long years .
Her history would tell how seed care

lessly sown is sometimes reaped in anguish , and how a
golden harvest may follow a painful planting .
If I mis

take not, you may be able to read the written record
before long ; that is, if you are familiar with the Dutch
language .
In the witty but earnest author, whose words

are welcomed at this day in thousands of Holland homes,
few could recognize the haughty, ﬂipp ant Rychie, who
scoffed at little Gretel .

Lambert van M ounen and Ludwig van Holp are good

Christian men, and , what is more easily to be seen at a
glance, thriving citizens .
Both are dwellers in Amster

dam ; but one clings to the old city of that name, and
the other is a pilgrim to the
new .

pleasant summer afternoons, when the pond-lilies rear
their queenly heads above the water .

The
Story of Hans Brinker would be but half told , if

we did not leave him with Gretel standing near .
Dear,

quick, patient little Gretel !
What is she now ?
Ask

old Dr . Boekm an : he will , d ecla r e she is the ﬁnest singer,
the loveliest woman, in Amsterdam . Ask Hans and Annie
they Will assure you she is the
clearest sister ever known .

Ask her husband ,

-h e who wore the red cap on the day

of the grand skating-race : you will learn that
Sh e is the

brightest, sweetest little wife in Holland .
Ask Dame

Brinker and
Raﬁ :
their eyes will glisten with joyous

tears .
Ask the poor : the air will be ﬁlled with b lessmgs.

But, lest you forget a tiny form trembling and sob

bing on the mound before the Brinker cottage, ask the
Van Glecks : they will never weary telling of the darling
little girl who won the silver skates .
