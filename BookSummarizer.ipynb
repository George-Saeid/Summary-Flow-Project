            "First paragraph :  For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country. Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter. As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, 'Let me see the child, and die.' The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him: 'Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.' 'Lor bless her dear heart, no!' interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.\n",

One day, a Brazilian journalist phoned to say that President Clinton had been photographed reading the book. Some time later, when I was in Turkey, I opened the magazine Vanity Fair and there was Julia Roberts declaring that she adored the book. Walking alone down a street in Miami, I heard a girl telling her mother: “You must read The Alchemist!” The book has been translated into fifty-six languages, has sold more than twenty million copies, and people are beginning to ask: What’s the secret behind such a huge success? The only honest response is: I don’t know. All I know is that, like Santiago the shepherd boy, we all need to be aware of our personal calling. What is a personal calling? It is God’s blessing, it is the path that God chose for you here on Earth. Whenever we do something that fills us with enthusiasm, we are following our legend. However, we don’t all have the courage to confront our own dream. Why? There are four obstacles. First: we are told from childhood onward that everything we want to do is impossible. We grow up with this idea, and as the years accumulate, so too do the layers of calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be invisible. But it’s still there. afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in be happy and are prepared to accompany us on that journey. Once we have accepted that love is a stimulus, we come up work out, because we cannot fall back on the old excuse: “Oh, well, I staked everything on it and that the path of the personal calling is no easier than any other path, except that our whole heart is in this journey. Then, we warriors of light must be prepared to have patience in difficult times and to know that the Universe is conspiring in our favor, even though we may not understand how. I ask myself: are defeats necessary? Well, necessary or not, they happen. When we first begin fighting for our dream, we have no experience and make many mistakes. The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times. only going to suffer more than other people? Because, once we have overcome the defeats—and we always worthy of the miracle of life. Each day, each hour, is part of the good unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest of our lives. Having disinterred our dream, having used the power of love to the very next day. Then comes the fourth obstacle: the fear of realizing the dream for which we fought all our lives.

            "First paragraph :  The Count of Monte Cristo. Alexander Dumas. Open Purchase the entire Coradella Collegiate Bookshelf on CD at http://collegebookshelf.net http://collegebookshelf.net About the author Alexandre Dumas was born Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie in Villers-Cotterêts, Aisne, near Paris, France, the grandson of the Marquis Antoine-Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie. While his grandfather served the government of France as General Commissaire in the Artillery in the colony of Santo Domingo, (today’s Dominican Republic but at the time a part of Haiti), he married MarieCéssette Dumas, a black slave. In 1762, she gave birth to a son, ThomasAlexandre, and she died soon thereafter. When the Marquis and his young son returned to Normandy, it was at a time when slavery still existed, and the boy suﬀered as a result of being half black. In 1786, Thomas- Alexandre joined the French army, but to protect the aristocratic family’s reputation, he enlisted using his mother’s maiden name. Following the Revolution in France, the Marquis lost his estates but his mulatto son, Thomas- Alexandre Dumas, distinguished himself as a capable and daring soldier in Napoleon Bonaparte’s army, rising through the ranks to become a General by the age of 31. General Dumas married Marie-Louise Elizabeth Labouret and in 1802 she gave birth to their son, Alexandre Dumas, who would become France’s most commercially successful author. General Dumas died in 1806 when Alexandre was only four, leaving a nearly impoverished mother to raise him under diﬃcult conditions. Unable to provide her son with much in the way of education, it nonetheless did not hinder young Alexandre’s love of books and he read everything he could get his hands on. Growing up, his mother’s stories of his father’s brave military deeds during the glory years of Napoleon, spawned Alexandre’s vivid imagination for adventure and heroes. Although poor, the family still had the father’s distinguished reputation and aristocratic connections and after the restoration of the monarchy, twenty-year-old Alexandre Dumas moved to Paris where he obtained employment at the Palais-Royal in the oﬃce of the powerful duc d’Orléans. While working in Paris, Dumas began to write articles for magazines as well as plays for the theatre. In 1829 his ﬁrst play was produced, meeting with great public acclaim. The following year his second play proved equally popular and as a result, he was ﬁnancially able to work full time at writing. However, in 1830, he participated in the revolution that ousted King Charles X and replaced him on the throne with Dumas’ former employer, the duc d’Orléans, who would rule as Louis-Philippe, the Citizen King. Until the mid 1830s, life in France remained unsettled with sporadic riots by disgruntled Republicans and impoverished urban workers seeking change. As life slowly returned to normal, the nation began to industrialize and with an improving economy combined with the end of press censorship, the times turned out to be a very rewarding for the skills of Alexandre Dumas. After writing more successful plays, he turned his eﬀorts to novels.\n",
